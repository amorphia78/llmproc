    <p>Roger Hallam, the founder of Extinction Rebellion, has admitted he would block an ambulance carrying a dying patient to hospital. In response to footage of a woman begging Insulate Britain campaigners to let her pass through their roadblock outside the Blackwall Tunnel, Hallam confirmed he too would have blocked her way.<br><br>Speaking on The London Economic Podcast, Hallam said he would have &quot;stayed there&quot; and confirmed he wouldn&#x27;t move even if the emergency vehicle was carrying a dying patient. He justified his stance by saying, &quot;What we&#x27;re talking about is the loss of people&#x27;s pensions in the next ten years, the loss of people&#x27;s incomes, the mass migration of hundreds of millions of people, the indescribable injustice to people of colour in the global south because of the collective selfishness of people in the north.&quot;<br><br>The protesters have glued themselves to the road and blocked both sides of the Blackwall Tunnel on the northbound A102, resulting in traffic chaos for rush hour drivers. A distressed woman was seen pleading with activists to move so she could follow an ambulance rushing her 81-year-old mum to hospital.</p>

    <p><br><br>Thirty-eight people have been arrested on suspicion of disrupting the highway and conspiracy to cause public nuisance, according to the Metropolitan Police. The Met stated, &quot;We consider protests of this nature unreasonable and are acting as quickly as possible to minimise disruption caused to members of the public using the roads.&quot;<br><br>The group, calling for all homes in the UK to be insulated by 2030, has carried out ten protests in three weeks. In response to these actions, Boris Johnson is threatening prison sentences of up to six months and unlimited fines for protesters who try to block motorways in the future. The government is also taking out a fresh injunction aimed at preventing climate activists from blocking roads.</p>
