        <h1>Jury acquits Extinction Rebellion protesters despite ‘no defence in law’</h1>
        
<p>Six Extinction Rebellion activists have been cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell&#x27;s London headquarters in 2019, despite the judge directing jurors that they had no defence in law. The protesters, including two of the group&#x27;s co-founders, were acquitted after a trial at Southwark crown court.<br><br><br><br>Prosecutor Diana Wilson told jurors that each of the defendants deliberately sprayed graffiti or smashed windows of the Shell building in Belvedere Road, central London, on 15 April 2019. The protest, which saw activists pour fake oil, glue themselves to windows and doors, break glass, climb on to a roof and spray graffiti, was part of wider Extinction Rebellion demonstrations across the capital.<br><br><br><br>Wilson said that while some protesters stood outside the building holding banners or speaking through megaphones, &quot;these defendants went further&quot;, adding: &quot;The seven involved caused significant damage.&quot;<br><br><br><br>All those who stood trial explained they had targeted the Shell building because the oil giant was directly contributing to the climate crisis, thereby causing serious injury and death, and argued that it was a &quot;necessary&quot; and &quot;proportionate&quot; response to the harm being caused.</p>

    <p><br><br>Judge Gregory Perrins directed jurors that even if they thought the protesters were &quot;morally justified&quot;, it did not provide them with a lawful excuse to commit criminal damage. However, the jury of seven women and five men took seven hours and four minutes to acquit them of both charges.<br><br><br><br>The defendants, who represented themselves, were jubilant as they left court. One of the acquitted protesters, Simon Bramwell, said: &quot;This is such a significant victory for the consciousness of the British people when it comes to the huge, immediate threat of climate change and the absolute failure of our government to do anything meaningful about it.&quot;</p></body></html>
