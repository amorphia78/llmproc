    <p>Raj Chada, defending, said an independent review, commissioned by Hertfordshire Police, found officers had been placed under &quot;significant political pressure&quot;.<br><br>However, Judge Sally Fudge found Ms Patel&#x27;s conversations with senior officers had not influenced decisions taken on the ground.<br><br>Convicting the defendants, Judge Fudge said that while the demonstration was &quot;peaceful&quot; it had a significant impact on the ability of businesses to function and caused newspapers to lose an estimated £1m.<br><br>Laura Frandsen, who has two previous convictions for similar offences, was ordered to pay a £150 fine, and to pay the court £150 with a surcharge of £34.<br><br>The other five defendants were given 12-month conditional discharges and ordered to pay £150 to the court and a £22 surcharge.</body></html>
