    <p>Footage captures a dramatic confrontation between a motorist and Insulate Britain protesters blocking the road. The incident occurred during a school run near the Dartford Crossing at Purfleet, Essex, where protesters had disrupted traffic at an industrial estate.<br><br>A woman in a Range Rover, attempting to take her 11-year-old son to school, confronts the protesters. She screams at them, &quot;Let me take my son to school,&quot; and demands they move out of the way. After her initial pleas are ignored, the woman returns to her vehicle and drives at a pair of protesters, pushing them along the road.<br><br>The confrontation escalates as the woman exits her car again, shouting, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what the f***ing issue is, my son needs to get to school.&quot; Other bystanders can be heard swearing at the protesters and encouraging the woman&#x27;s actions.</p>

    <p><br><br>Insulate Britain, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, has been causing disruptions for motorists in recent weeks with sit-ins on major roads, including the M25. The group is demanding that the UK Government implement policy and funding for a national home insulation programme, starting with social housing. They are calling on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to make &quot;significant legislative change to start lowering emissions.&quot;<br><br>The protesters have caused misery for motorists in recent weeks with sit-ins on the M25, Britain's busiest motorway. Their actions have faced accusations of hypocrisy, with the group&#x27;s ringleader Liam Norton admitting he &quot;doesn&#x27;t care&quot; about insulation and reportedly not insulating his own home.</p>
