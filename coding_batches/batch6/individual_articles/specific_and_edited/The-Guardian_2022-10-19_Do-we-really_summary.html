        <h1>Do we really care more about Van Gogh’s sunflowers than real ones?</h1><p>Two Just Stop Oil activists threw soup at Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers in the National Gallery in London, decorating the glass protecting the painting with tomato soup. The painting itself was undamaged, as the protesters had calculated. This action appears to have horrified some people more than the collapse of our planet, which these campaigners are seeking to prevent.<br><br>The protesters&#x27; tactics have been labeled &quot;extreme&quot; by some, who claim that such actions will prompt people to &quot;stop listening.&quot; However, we are already paying little attention to warnings from scientists, campaigners, and eminent committees about the destruction of the habitable planet.<br><br>The response by the media and government to this protest action has been significant. Home Secretary Suella Braverman claimed that while there is widespread agreement on the need to protect the environment, &quot;democracies reach decisions in a civilised manner.&quot; So what are the democratic means of contesting the government’s decision to award more than 100 new licences to drill for oil and gas in the North Sea?</p>

    <p><br><br>Disruptive protest actions are necessary to shake us out of our stupor regarding the climate crisis. We are approaching planetary tipping points with unimaginable consequences, and more drastic measures are needed to alert people to the scale of the crisis.<br><br>the government is carefully criminalising every effective means of protest in England and Wales, leaving us with nothing but authorised processions conducted in near silence and letters to our MPs, which are universally ignored by both media and legislators.<br><br>Whenever I visit the National Gallery, I can’t help but wonder how many of the places in its treasured landscape paintings have been destroyed by development or agriculture. But if someone were to burn or slash the paintings themselves, it would be an abhorrent act of brutality. Why is life less valuable than the depiction of life?</p></body></html>
