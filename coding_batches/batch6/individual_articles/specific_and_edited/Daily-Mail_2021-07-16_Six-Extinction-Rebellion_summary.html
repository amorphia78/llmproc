    <p>Six Extinction Rebellion activists have been convicted of obstructing the highway after blockading a national newspaper printing press in a demonstration that cost publishers more than £1million. The protest, which took place on September 4 at the Newsprinters printing works in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, stopped 3.5million newspapers from reaching readers.<br><br>Around 50 XR members used vehicles and bamboo structures as lock-ons to deny access to or from the Broxbourne site. The protest lasted 14 hours and targeted certain parts of the print media who, according to the defendants, &quot;failed to accurately report on the climate crisis and are guilty of corruption&quot;.<br><br>Judge Sally Fudge at St Albans Magistrates&#x27; Court found that while the demonstration was &#x27;peaceful&#x27;, it had a significant impact on the ability of businesses to function. The protest caused a &quot;loss of business revenue valued at over £1 million&quot; and had a ripple effect from distributors to individual consumers.</p>

    <p><br><br>The six convicted protesters, aged between 30 and 56, received conditional discharges or small fines. Judge Fudge noted that the protesters spoke in their defense &quot;with passion and clarity&quot; and had clearly thought carefully about their actions.<br><br>The Newsprinters presses publish titles including the Sun, Times, Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, and London Evening Standard. Extinction Rebellion said it is considering an appeal against the convictions, stating they will &quot;continue to demand that the press tell the truth about the climate and ecological emergency.&quot;</p>
