    <p>Comic Rob Beckett was running late to a recording of his new audio book when his taxi was unable to arrive at the studio due to road closures caused by the march. He set off on foot and attempted to glide past the jeering crowds but accidentally got caught up in the protests, sparking news crews into thinking he was a major Stop The Oil ringleader.</p>
    
    <p>On Sunday, Stop The Oil protesters occupied London bridges and lied down in the middle of the road as they brought the capital to a standstill. Met Police confirmed they made 31 arrests on the second day of a month-long campaign to protest against soaring energy prices and climate crisis.<br><br>The protests were the start of an &#x27;October uprising&#x27; revealed last week in an undercover investigation by The Mail on Sunday. Just Stop Oil boasted it had &#x27;brought central London to a standstill by blocking four key bridges to Westminster – Waterloo, Westminster, Lambeth and Vauxhall.<br><br>A JSO spokesman said: &#x27;We will continue in civil resistance until this government takes immediate steps to meet our demand to end the cost-of-living and climate crisis by stopping new oil and gas. We need to start a rapid transformation to a fairer society, decided by ordinary people and paid for by those who are profiting from humanity&#x27;s destruction.&#x27;</p>

    <p><br><br>The disruptive action caused significant traffic issues in central London, with roads closed and public transportation disrupted. The protesters&#x27; tactics of occupying bridges and lying down in the middle of roads effectively paralyzed parts of the city, drawing attention to their cause but also inconveniencing many commuters and residents.<br><br>The Met Police&#x27;s response, resulting in 31 arrests, highlights the ongoing tension between the protesters&#x27; right to demonstrate and the authorities&#x27; duty to maintain public order and keep the city functioning.</p>
