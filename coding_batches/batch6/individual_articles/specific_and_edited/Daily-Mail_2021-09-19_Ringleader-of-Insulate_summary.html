    <p>A ringleader of the M25-blocking eco-group Insulate Britain does not have insulation in his own home, according to reports. Liam Norton&#x27;s south-west London home is single-glazed, has no cavity wall insulation and uses gas central heating, reports the Sun.<br><br>Mr Norton, an electrician, is one of the leading figures in Insulate Britain - an Extinction Rebellion off-shoot campaigning the Government to reduce home heating emissions to zero. The group infuriated motorists three times last week by blocking the M25 in a bid to put pressure on the Government to pay for all social housing to be fully insulated.<br><br>Mr Norton&#x27;s property is owned by a housing association. When asked about his home&#x27;s lack of insulation, Mr Norton told the Sun: &#x27;This is a good example of one of Britain&#x27;s leaky homes and why we need the Government to get on with the job.&#x27;<br><br>As many as 80 activists from the Insulate Britain group brought the motorway to a halt on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Members of the group sat, and some even glued themselves to the road, causing huge delays for drivers.</p>

    <p><br><br>Police chiefs came under intense pressure for the way they tackled the protests, with Priti Patel summoning Met Commissioner Cressida Dick and other force bosses responsible for the M25 after they failed to drag away protesters &#x27;immediately&#x27;. The anger at the police&#x27;s handling of the situation was increased after photos emerged showing some protesters attending all three demonstrations, despite being previously arrested.<br><br>The Home Secretary held an emergency Zoom call with police chiefs after protesters shut down the UK&#x27;s busiest road during rush hour every 48 hours this week. A source close to the Home Secretary said she reiterated her message that &#x27;these people are breaking the law and must be removed immediately&#x27;.</p>
