    <p>Air passengers faced huge queues at London airports last night as border chaos continued to affect UK holidaymakers, with Stansted and Heathrow badly hit amid claims of long waits.<br><br>Team GB hockey player Shona McCallin was among those returning to Heathrow yesterday and filmed a video showing how most of the Border Force desks were closed while travellers continued to stand in line. Others said the queues were so bad at Stansted that they missed the last train to London Liverpool Street station and were instead faced with paying £180 for an Uber for what is normally a £55 journey.<br><br>Since international travel reopened in May, there have been huge queues at Heathrow, with some passengers reporting three-hour waits at passport gates. The Home Office has admitted the situation is &#x27;unacceptable&#x27;.<br><br>Ricardo Abreum, chief product officer at payments service ePayments in London, was caught up in the Stansted chaos at midnight last night. He told MailOnline: &quot;It was a ridiculous situation that happens too often. The flight landed at 11.20pm, I left the airport at 1.30am.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>At Heathrow, Ibrahim Harb, who works in marketing, tweeted a video of huge queues shortly before 2pm yesterday, saying: &quot;Unacceptable queuing time in Heathrow. Some passengers have been waiting for six hours.&quot;<br><br>The recent chaos at Britain&#x27;s borders has been driven by &#x27;nightmare&#x27; changes to guards&#x27; rotas which have forced them to work long shifts. An IT failure at Heathrow last Friday caused further problems, with thousands of people forced to wait in queues of up to three hours.<br><br>A Border Force official suggested that the problems are at least partly caused by changes to the staff rota which saw shifts extended by two hours in August. The Immigration Services Union backed up these claims, saying that a range of rostering issues during the Covid-19 pandemic has created &#x27;chaos for staff and caused widespread resentment&#x27;.</p>
