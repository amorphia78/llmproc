Just Stop Oil activists have announced an immediate halt to their protests on the M25 motorway. The environmental group has been blocking parts of the busy motorway for four days, leading to multiple arrests. #GE #MS A spokesman for the group stated that no protests would be held on Friday or in the "foreseeable future," allowing the government "to do the right thing." #ME #GS #ES The Metropolitan Police reported that 58 people had been charged over the four days of protests. #EE #GE #MS Just Stop Oil's primary demand is for the government to halt new licences for the exploration of oil and other fossil fuels in the UK. #ME #GS During the protests, activists climbed on overhead gantries in multiple locations of the M25, causing the motorway to be closed. A police officer was injured during Wednesday's protests when a collision occurred involving a police motorcyclist and two lorries during a rolling roadblock. #GE #NS Chief Constable BJ Harrington warned that it is "only a matter of time" before someone is killed during a protest. The Home Office stated it was giving police strengthened powers to "match the rise in guerrilla protest tactics," noting that the serious disruption is extremely dangerous and costs taxpayers millions while draining police resources. #NE

Title: Left-wing activists slam Ryan Gosling's movie The Fall Guy for closing down Sydney Harbour Bridge - after climate protester was sent to jail for eight months for blocking the expressway

Left-wing activists have taken to Twitter to criticize the closure of Sydney Harbour Bridge this weekend for filming of Ryan Gosling's The Fall Guy. #GS #ES The closure comes weeks after climate change protester Deanna 'Violet' Coco, 31, was sent to prison in December for eight months after she blocked a lane in April. #EE #GE Twitter activists fumed at what they called a 'double standard' #NS after Ms Coco was put behind bars for what a magistrate called 'selfish emotional' actions. #NE One wrote, 'Filming a Ryan Gosling flick closes the Harbour Bridge. All good. But a woman delays traffic on same to protest fossil fuels and she's imprisoned. Got it.' #GS The court was told Coco drove a large hire truck along the Cahill Expressway on the bridge to purposefully block a lane during peak hour on April 13, around 8.30am. While the truck was obstructing traffic, she stood on top of it, held a lit emergency flare and livestreamed the event. After 25 minutes, police arrived and forcibly removed the protesters from the iconic Sydney landmark, #ES with Coco resisting arrest. #EE #GE
#PH #CS  #CE
#MS Defence lawyer Mark Davis told the court a 'salient fact' in Coco's case was that she only blocked one lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge when there were five. 'One lane was blocked ... it was a deliberate decision to only block one lane,' Mr Davis said. 'To put it simply, the traffic may have still been moving, there was no suggestion there was backup of traffic.' #ME #ES Coco was convicted and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight months. Her legal counsel immediately filed an appeal. #EE Coco is a serial protester and a member of climate activist groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Fireproof Australia.

Subtitle: #GS The eco-activist, who helped to block roads on the M25, #GE drove from Cambridge to Poland in a diesel van after a four-month stint in Canada

#GS Cameron Ford, an Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain activist, gained notoriety last month after #ES spending his 31st birthday in a police cell #EE for blocking roads on the M25. The carpenter from Whittlesford, Cambridge, remained unapologetic for the disruption to motorists, #MS commenting at the time: "I hope by causing disruption through civil disobedience that we can get our message across." #ME Mr Ford's actions were part of a series of protests aimed at disrupting traffic on the M25 motorway. The protests were organized by Insulate Britain, a group #GE #MS demanding that the government insulate all social housing in Britain by 2025 and retrofit all homes with improved insulation by 2030. #ME However, new photos have emerged reportedly showing Mr Ford indulging in globe-trotting holidays across Canada and Europe. Photographs reveal the activist embarked on a four-month holiday across Canada in the autumn of 2019, potentially involving a round trip of 8,500 miles in flights. It is believed he travelled at least 1,500 miles within Canada during the jaunt, which could amount to a total of 10,000 miles travelled.

When challenged by the Telegraph over his holidays, Mr Ford did not deny the existence of the photos. Speaking from atop the roof of a garden shed, Mr Ford told the Telegraph: #MS "If we start looking for anyone who is not a hypocrite we are not going to solve the problem. I am not perfect, I want a future that is liveable. This is not about me." #ME He claimed the photos published by the Mail Online were an attempt to "demonise" him. Mr Ford confirmed to the Telegraph he had travelled to Poland with his girlfriend to visit her family.
