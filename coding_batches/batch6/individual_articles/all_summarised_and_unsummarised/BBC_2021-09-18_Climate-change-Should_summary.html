        <h1>Climate change: Should green campaigners put more pressure on China to slash emissions?</h1>

    <p>Climate activists in the UK have been blocking motorways to pressure the government on climate action, but some question whether this is the right target given China&#x27;s much larger share of global emissions. China produces 28% of global emissions compared to the UK&#x27;s 1%.<br><br>However, when asked about demonstrating against China, the radical green group Extinction Rebellion (XR) responded furiously. An XR member accused the questioner of perpetuating anti-Chinese racist stereotypes and failing to report climate change properly.<br><br>There are practical reasons for this response: climate groups like Greenpeace and WWF have offices in Beijing and could be shut down if they protest too strongly. Additionally, China is considered a developing country in climate negotiations, and targeting China could ease pressure on historically wealthy nations like the UK to cut emissions.</p>

    <p><br><br>Climate diplomacy acknowledges that rich countries with a longer history of industrialization have caused most of the warming so far. Moreover, much of China&#x27;s CO2 emissions come from manufacturing goods for Western consumers.<br><br>While stronger action from Beijing is essential to prevent further global heating, some argue that China is not as blameworthy as it seems. The issue of fairness is embedded in international climate negotiations, with rich nations expected to take more responsibility for historic pollution.<br><br>Despite these considerations, some veteran activists and commentators believe green groups should reconsider their approach to China. They suggest small, polite pickets at Chinese embassies worldwide as a potential strategy to exert pressure without giving ammunition to climate change deniers.</p>
