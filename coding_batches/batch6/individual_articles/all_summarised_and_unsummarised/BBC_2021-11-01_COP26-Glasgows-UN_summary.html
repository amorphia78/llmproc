    <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has addressed world leaders at Glasgow&#x27;s COP26 climate change summit. The UK is hosting the two-week conference, which was delayed by a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. About 25,000 delegates are attending, with thousands of activists also travelling to Scotland&#x27;s biggest city for fringe events and protests.<br><br>The opening ceremony began with a performance by Skye musician Br√¨ghde Chaimbeul, followed by Mr Johnson&#x27;s speech. The PM told leaders and delegates that the &quot;anger and the impatience of the world&quot; would be uncontainable &quot;unless we make this COP26 in Glasgow the moment that we get real about climate change&quot;.<br><br>Climate activists from vulnerable parts of the world, including one from the Amazon, spoke about the threat climate change poses to them. Prince Charles, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, and Sir David Attenborough also addressed the gathering.</p>

    <p><br><br>World leaders, including US President Joe Biden, arrived in Glasgow to outline their climate plans. Scotland&#x27;s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged the &quot;mixed message&quot; of air travel involved but emphasized the importance of in-person meetings for progress.<br><br>The summit has caused some travel disruption in Glasgow. Congestion on the M8 was exacerbated by traffic accidents, with tailbacks reported from the city centre to Glasgow Airport. The Clydeside Expressway and Clyde Arc near the COP26 site were closed, increasing peak-time delays.<br><br>The COP26 global climate summit is seen as crucial for bringing climate change under control, with almost 200 countries being asked for their plans to cut emissions.
