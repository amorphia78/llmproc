    <p>Two climate change protesters glued themselves to the frame of John Constable&#x27;s painting &#x27;The Hay Wain&#x27; in London&#x27;s National Gallery today, shocking visitors and forcing the evacuation of art tourists and a class of 11-year-olds on a school trip.<br><br>Music student Eben Lazarus, 22, and psychology student Hannah Hunt, 23, both from Brighton, stepped over a rope barrier wearing white T-shirts with the logo of Just Stop Oil (JSO). They attached themselves to the painting&#x27;s frame and placed their own image of &#x27;an apocalyptic vision&#x27; of the landscape&#x27;s future, featuring an old car dumped in front of the Mill and the Hay Wain cart carrying an old washing machine.<br><br>A video shared by JSO, a climate activist group, shows Lazarus and Hunt kneeling on the floor with a hand each on the frame. One protester told onlookers, &quot;I want to work in the arts not disrupt them, but the situation we are in means that we have to do everything nonviolently possible to prevent the civilisational collapse that we are hurtling towards.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Hunt later stated that the disruption will end when the government makes a &#x27;meaningful statement&#x27; that it will end new oil and gas licences. She added, &quot;I&#x27;m here because our government plans to license 40 new UK oil and gas projects in the next few years. This makes them complicit in pushing the world towards an unlivable climate and in the death of billions of people in the coming decades.&quot;<br><br>The Metropolitan Police were called to the scene at 2.25pm by staff, and the gallery confirmed that the room was closed to the public.</p>
