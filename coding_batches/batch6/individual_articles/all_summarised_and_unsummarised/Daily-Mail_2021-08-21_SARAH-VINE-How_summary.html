    <p>There are few topics that divide opinion more keenly in my house than Love Island. The Teenagers, each in their unique way, are obsessed. My daughter watches it with her boyfriend; they seem to love and hate it in equal measure, taking sides furiously while at the same time disparaging the show&#x27;s obvious flaws.<br><br>My son takes a more straightforward view. &quot;I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s not to like about being sent to Majorca and being paid to have as much sex as you can with a load of fit women. Then come home to five million followers on Instagram and a bunch of brands desperate to sign you up and never having to work again,&quot; he said.<br><br>His view is largely representative of his age group and, I suspect, the reason why Love Island is such a ratings-grabber. It boasts lucrative sponsorship and product-placement deals worth somewhere north of £70 million, with brands including Tinder, Just Eat, JD Sports and various other sources of youthful gratification.<br><br>It&#x27;s also why I hate it so much. Hate the vacuous messages it sends and the cynical way it manipulates the contestants. Hate the cookie-cutter version of physical desirability it promotes. Hate the fleshy vulgarity of it and, perhaps most of all, hate the rank hypocrisy and sheer brass neck of ITV for screening it alongside adverts for mental health charities.</p>

    <p><br><br>This series has led to a record 33,540 complaints to the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom. It is representative of everything that is depressingly soul-destroying about the modern world. The plastic surgery, the absence of morals, the something-for-nothing culture.<br><br>It&#x27;s barbaric and gladiatorial in the way it presents suffering as entertainment, encouraging us to salivate and pore over glistening young bodies. There&#x27;s something of the Colosseum about the way these muscle-bound young people are forced to demonstrate their physical and sexual prowess for the pleasure of the spectator.<br><br>It&#x27;s cruel, crass and exploitative. And it demeans us all. Tomorrow is the final episode. Let&#x27;s hope it&#x27;s the last.</p>
