    <p>Protest group Extinction Rebellion (XR) is carrying out a week of demonstrations to highlight what it says is government inaction on climate change.<br><br>On Wednesday, some protesters glued themselves to the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) over the government&#x27;s commitment to keep drilling for North Sea oil and gas.<br><br>Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the group via social media: &quot;You cannot - and we won&#x27;t - switch off domestic oil and gas production.&quot;<br><br>Extinction Rebellion protests this week have focused on tackling the UK&#x27;s reliance on oil and other fossil fuels.<br><br>XR Scientists - the sub-group protesting at BEIS - has accused the government of &quot;irresponsible and dangerous pursuit&quot; of fossil fuels, which is incompatible with climate change.<br><br>The UK currently gets 80% of its energy from fossil fuels.<br><br>In April, the government published the new UK Energy Security Strategy, which included new licensing for North Sea oil and gas, and a new investigation into fracking.<br><br>The group describes itself as an international &quot;non-violent civil disobedience&quot; movement.<br><br>It says life on Earth is in crisis and facing a mass extinction. It wants governments to declare a &quot;climate and ecological emergency&quot; and take immediate action.<br><br>The group uses an hourglass inside a circle as its logo, to represent time running out for many species.<br><br>In the UK, Extinction Rebellion has three main demands:<br><br>Reducing CO2 emissions to almost zero in such a short period would be extremely ambitious.<br><br>Severe restrictions on flying would be needed. Diets would have to change by drastically cutting back on meat and dairy.<br><br>And there would have to be a massive increase in renewable energy, along with many other radical changes.<br><br>However, the group itself doesn&#x27;t say exactly what the solutions to tackle climate change should be.<br><br>Instead, it wants the government to create a &quot;citizens&#x27; assembly&quot;, made up of ordinary people. They would decide how to solve the climate crisis, with advice from experts.</p>

    <p>The group often uses disruptive tactics to highlight its demands.<br><br>Police made 480 arrests during protests in London last year.<br><br>Across a two-week period in August and September, activists blocked Oxford Circus and erected a giant table in Covent Garden. More than 130 people locked or glued themselves to roads and buildings.<br><br>This followed previous campaigns across London, Manchester and Cardiff in 2019 and 2020.<br><br>There have also been protests in other countries:<br><br>Insulate Britain launched last autumn and called for a national programme to ensure homes are insulated to be low energy by 2030.<br><br>It is supported by some members of Extinction Rebellion and its allied networks - although the groups are not officially integrated.<br><br>Insulate Britain is a much smaller UK-specific campaigning organisation.<br><br>Many of those directly affected by protests have objected to the tactics used by both Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion.<br><br>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has accused both groups of being &quot;crusties&quot; who block the streets and cause disruption.<br><br>Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said while there was a place for direct action, Insulate Britain was &quot;not necessarily always doing it in the most constructive way&quot;.<br><br>But District Judge Stephen Leake who fined some Insulate Britain protesters for blocking the M25 motorway, said he was &quot;inspired&quot; by their climate concerns.<br><br>Younger people are most likely to agree with its aims, according to a survey of more than 3,000 people carried out after the London 2019 protests.<br><br>Among 18 to 24-year-olds, 41% either &quot;strongly supported&quot; or &quot;somewhat supported&quot; the disruption of traffic and public transport in London to highlight Extinction Rebellion&#x27;s aims.<br><br>That compared with 33% of those aged 50-65, and 26% of over-65s.</p></body></html>
