    <p>&quot;I found myself feeling just so completely and utterly helpless, and realised I had to take action.&quot;<br><br>Claudia Penna Rojas became a part of climate activist group Just Stop Oil in February.<br><br>You might know them for their protest actions which have included tying themselves to football goalposts, climbing on oil tankers and stopping traffic.<br><br>&quot;I was aware of global warming as an issue, but the urgency of the situation has sunk in,&quot; 24-year-old Claudia tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.<br><br>Many of the impacts of global warming are now simply &quot;irreversible&quot;, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with their scientific reports being described as &quot;a code red for humanity&quot; by the UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres.<br><br>Just Stop Oil describe themselves as a &quot;coalition of groups working together&quot; to demand the government stop the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels - like oil, gas and coal - in the UK.<br><br>It has divided opinion, with some criticising their disruptive tactics and others praising them for raising attention.<br><br>Methods such as strikes, boycotts and mass protests - often used by climate protest groups to make their point - have been criticised for being extreme, &quot;selfish&quot; and creating too much disruption to people&#x27;s lives.<br><br>Members of the group have broken the law and been arrested for offences such as criminal damage.<br><br>Some politicians have condemned the group&#x27;s tactics for causing lives to be &quot;brought to a standstill&quot;.<br><br>Newsbeat has been finding out more from the individuals involved in the group.<br><br>Claudia moved to the UK aged eight, from Chile, where most of her family still live. She says Chile has faced &quot;mega droughts&quot; for many years, and believes it&#x27;s a result of climate change.<br><br>&quot;People don&#x27;t have access to water and I&#x27;m terrified that within the next few years, my family could be struggling to survive.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now&#x27;s the time where we have to give it absolutely everything. It doesn&#x27;t really feel like a choice, it feels like a duty.&quot;<br><br>She hoped one day to have a family of her own, but doesn&#x27;t think that&#x27;ll happen because of the climate crisis, saying it &quot;feels unfair&quot; to bring a child into &quot;this world&quot;.<br><br>For Zak, he was living &quot;a normal child&#x27;s life&#x27;, when he started to see &quot;there was injustice in the world&quot; from the age of 12.<br><br>&quot;I thought what I&#x27;ve been doing for the past two years in the animal rights movement, it&#x27;s not achieved much change,&quot; the 15-year-old says.<br><br>&quot;I was looking to get involved in action, which is going to create change.&quot;<br><br>Zak joined the group after being inspired by the Insulate Britain campaign, who were known for gluing themselves to the motorway and stopping traffic.</p>

    <p>Xanthe Flynn, who uses the pronouns they/them, says they don&#x27;t like to &quot;call it activism because it&#x27;s my whole life&quot;.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s not just a protest that you go and do, and then you go back to your safe space,&quot; the 18-year-old says.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s also been a massive learning space. Because I didn&#x27;t get taught really about this in school.&quot;<br><br>Zak and Xanthe have both been arrested as a result of their actions.<br><br>&quot;I sat on top of an oil tanker for about six, seven hours before I was arrested,&quot; Zak says.<br><br>Zak says being held by police &quot;isn&#x27;t the nicest thing&quot; but is &quot;incomparable to the consequences of climate change&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Being arrested is not something any of us want to do, it&#x27;s quite scary,&quot; Xanthe adds.<br><br>As for the impact on their futures of having a police record, both are concerned, but &quot;it&#x27;s not the most important thing&quot; Xanthe says.<br><br>&quot;I&#x27;ll explain to future employers why I was arrested. And if they don&#x27;t understand I think it&#x27;ll be very hard to be in that job.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Would I really want to be employed by someone who judges me for getting arrested for doing something which is quite literally an act of love?,&quot; Zak adds.<br><br>But are there other, less disruptive ways to get their message across?<br><br>Claudia says they don&#x27;t &quot;want to cause disruption&quot; and adds their tactics are &quot;not something they choose to do for fun&quot;.<br><br>After years of petitions and words, she adds &quot;we&#x27;re out of time&quot;.<br><br>&quot;What other options are we left with, apart from to put our bodies on the line,&quot; says Zak.<br><br>There has been criticism of the group for being &quot;middle-class, privileged&quot; young people, but Claudia says: &quot;If you have the privilege of being able to take that risk, then you have a duty to do so&quot;.<br><br>Zak, though, says he has encountered people from lots of different backgrounds in the group.<br><br>&quot;They take time off work, some of them potentially risk their jobs.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a case of everyone being a trust fund kid whose lifestyles are funded by parents.<br><br>&quot;I think it&#x27;s a case of people caring about the future generations.&quot;<br><br>Xanthe is happy to use their privilege of &quot;being white and born in Oxford&quot;.<br><br>&quot;I can do that because I know that I might not get treated as badly, so the consequences won&#x27;t be so bad.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We can use our privilege. Because a lot of people can&#x27;t.&quot;<br><br>Despite feeling worried about the current situation, Claudia, Zak and Xanthe are united in still optimistic things can improve.<br><br>&quot;I think that we need to have hope to continue and hope that something will change,&quot; Xanthe adds.<br><br>Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.<br><br>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.</p>
