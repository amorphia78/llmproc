    <p>Protesters with Extinction Rebellion have blocked roads as they began a fortnight of action in London which they say will cause &#x27;significant disruption&#x27;. The environmental campaigners plan to continue from August 22 until September 5 in the hope of making headlines and getting people to take the climate crisis seriously.<br><br>A giant pink table has been placed in the middle of a busy junction in Covent Garden, painted with the slogan &#x27;come to the table&#x27; urging people to engage with climate policy. Activists also staged a party game in the street, saying that global leaders were playing &#x27;musical chairs&#x27; and &#x27;passing the buck&#x27; over the environment.<br><br>Gail Bradbrook, co-founder of the activist group, opened the &#x27;Impossible Rebellion&#x27; with a speech expressing solidarity with nations that are disproportionately affected by climate change. Demonstrations are scheduled in central locations including St James&#x27; Park and Piccadilly Circus.</p>

    <p><br><br>The Metropolitan Police said a &#x27;significant&#x27; operation would be put in place to manage the protests over the busy bank holiday weekend, but acknowledged the activists&#x27; &#x27;important cause&#x27;. In a tweet, they said: &#x27;A group of protesters have blocked the roads around Long Acre junction in #Westminster with a structure. Officers are on scene and specialist teams are being deployed. Road closures are in place.&#x27;<br><br>Several celebrities have backed the cause, with Stephen Fry praising the group in a video shared on Twitter, saying they were attempting to &#x27;recalibrate, realign, revolutionise politics&#x27; through their &#x27;mucky&#x27; and &#x27;disruptive&#x27; demonstrations.<br><br>Game of Thrones actor Jerome Flynn attended a protest, saying: &#x27;We&#x27;ve got used to certain systems that are life destructive, we created them, we&#x27;ve become addicted to them, and we know the world is burning as a result.&#x27;</p>
