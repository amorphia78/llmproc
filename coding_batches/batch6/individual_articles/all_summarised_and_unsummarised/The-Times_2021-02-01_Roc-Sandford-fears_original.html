        <h1>Roc Sandford fears for his children Blue and Lazer in HS2 tunnel protest</h1><p>An island laird has said that he fears for the lives of his son and daughter who are burrowed deep in a protest camp tunnel 500 miles away.<br><br>Speaking from his home on the Hebridean island of Gometra, Roc Sandford, an environmental activist, criticised health and safety chiefs.<br><br>Sandford said he had lodged a complaint with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) for failing to halt eviction tactics he claims have put the lives at risk of his daughter Blue, son Lazer, and other protesters.<br><br>Blue, 18, and Lazer, 20, are in a 100ft-long tunnel secretly constructed under Euston Square Gardens in London by activists protesting against HS2’s high-speed rail development plan.<br><br>As safety fears grow for the small band of eco warriors who have witnessed five soil collapses in the tunnel as eviction teams worked on gaining access, the father urged HSE to intervene before someone is hurt.<br><br>The protesters have been in the tunnel since Wednesday and are considering legal action against HSE.<br><br>Sandford said: “It is clear that a dangerous situation is rapidly evolving which is within HSE’s statutory obligations to address with utmost urgency.<br><br>“This is an emergency. HSE’s current response is totally inadequate. Heads will roll at HSE on this, ideally at the top, they need to get in there before someone gets seriously hurt. This is not a time to get bureaucratic and play for time, they need to get down to Euston and do their job, which is to listen to what the protesters are saying and address the life-threatening risks they are being subjected to at the hands of HS2 and NET (National Eviction Team).”<br><br>Reiterating allegations made by the protesters in video footage, and calls for help from the depths of the tunnel, Sandford claims the eviction team has put lives at risk by denying activists the right to monitor oxygen levels in the depths of the tunnel and allowing water to flood in. He added: “My son Lazer was injured by a tree root dropped on him from nine feet up. This is putting lives at risk. I am not a lawyer but my understanding is that the actions of NET are clearly unlawful.”<br><br>Sandford is a member of Extinction Rebellion and has attended many climate protests. Now his children are following in his footsteps, although he says he is not as brave as them.<br><br>“They have completely outclassed me in their protests which proves it isn’t coming from me,” he said. “I am always begging them to be careful and I sometimes feel like I am going to collapse with fear but I am also so proud of what they are achieving.” He added: “We’re putting children in danger by using petrol, diesel, gas. This puts carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which makes it heat up like a sauna, which causes food shortages, floods, burning forests and wars. It’s not a video game or a disaster movie, it’s real and it’s happening now all over the world and soon it will be happening to us.</p>

    <p>“Top climate scientists are saying governments like ours are risking killing almost all our children. It’s as simple as that. My children have burrowed deep under Euston with their friends to protest HS2. They are being besieged down there.<br><br>“It’s so scary and I have been going though a really dark and miserable place knowing I could lose them. They are so brave to do this but they shouldn’t have to carry this responsibility.”<br><br>Greg Smith, MP for Buckingham, said: “I am concerned for the safety of all involved in these protest tunnels and have raised my concerns about the use of the HS2 National Eviction Team for this with the minister.”<br><br>A spokesman for HSE said: “Concerns have been raised with HSE and these are being looked into. We remain in contact with HS2 in order to review any plans that would affect workers, protesters or rescue personnel.”<br><br>The Metropolitan Police did not wish to comment.<br><br>A spokeswoman for HS2 said: “We have had police and paramedics on the site and have had the London fire brigade there to assess the operation, and safety of all . . . remains at the forefront of everything we are doing.”<br><br>Defiant daughter<br><br>As her father feared for her life at his home in the Hebrides Blue Sandford said she had no regrets about joining the London tunnel protest (Moira Kerr writes).<br><br>Speaking from the heart of the tunnel in a late-night call on Saturday, the 18-year-old said: “I’m prepared to stay as long as it takes, I don’t regret doing this, I think it has a real chance of stopping HS2.”<br><br>She added: “We’re all doing well, there’s a lot of jokes and we’re staying strong. There’s a lot of water dripping down — most of the sleeping bags are wet and my clothes are soaked, but we’re safe.”<br><br>She claimed: “The bailiffs are being unsafe in jumping down on top of us in the down shaft and dropping loads of dirt on us . . . and removing our drainage system from the park, which is causing a lot of water to drip down, which caused the collapses before.<br><br>“The tunnel is completely stable now, we have not had any more collapses but as a precautionary measure it will be much safer once the bailiffs put back the drainage system and start working safely.”<br><br>The pupil, who is on school strike over government inaction on climate change, also claimed that the bailiffs were refusing to send an oxygen monitor down to the end of the tunnel.</p></body></html>
