    <p>Exactly 20 years ago, 28 Greenpeace activists were acquitted of criminal damage after destroying a field of genetically-modified (GM) maize on a farm in Norfolk. What led to this key moment in environmental protest?<br><br>In summer 1999, Michael Uwins was summoned to London by Greenpeace. The reason was on a &quot;need to know&quot; basis.<br><br>The group&#x27;s East of England co-ordinator, he had been trained in non-violent &quot;direct action&quot; and knew something was about to happen.<br><br>What followed would make international headlines and result in a landmark legal verdict that gave a boost to environmental activism.<br><br>A trial crop of GM maize had been planted at Lyng, near Dereham, Norfolk, not far from Mr Uwins&#x27; home.<br><br>Greenpeace opposed such trials, claiming they would cause genetic pollution of the environment.<br><br>&quot;We were told we had to &#x27;destroy that crop&#x27; - because it was about to flower,&quot; said Mr Uwins, now 74.<br><br>&quot;Before we made up our minds, we were given a percentage of the likelihood of arrest. It was 100%. That had never happened before.&quot;<br><br>So, at 05:00 BST on 26 July 1999, the protesters, including a vicar and a beauty consultant, stormed the six-acre (2.4 hectare) field of modified fodder maize, trampling and pulling at the 7ft (2.1m) plants.<br><br>Leading them, in white overalls, was Greenpeace executive director Lord Peter Melchett, a former government minister and himself a Norfolk farmer.<br><br>The activists destroyed a large section of the crop with a machine armed with whirling 4ft (1.2m) blades.<br><br>They planned to bag it up and deliver it to Norfolk-based GM contractors AgrEvo.<br><br>&quot;We totally believed in what we were doing,&quot; Mr Uwins said.<br><br>&quot;We were not anti-science or GM as such; it was about open-air field trials. It was irresponsible and had to be stopped.&quot;<br><br>According to embedded Guardian journalist John Vidal, the activists were confronted by &quot;furious&quot; landowner William Brigham and family members.<br><br>&quot;They were ramming and chasing the protesters around the field - it was all very dangerous,&quot; Mr Uwins said.<br><br>Mr Brigham declined to comment when contacted by the BBC this week.<br><br>The police arrived and, one by one, the protesters were arrested and charged with criminal damage and theft.<br><br>Mr Uwins recalls a &quot;surreal moment&quot; in custody. &quot;A station sergeant came round taking a fish supper order: who wanted cod, and so on.&quot;<br><br>The activists argued they had lawful excuse for their actions, to prevent neighbouring land from being unlawfully invaded by genetically-modified pollen.<br><br>&quot;We did what we did to prevent a crime&quot;, said Mr Uwins.<br><br>At Norwich Crown Court they were found not guilty of theft in April 2000, but the jury could not decide on the criminal damage charge and was discharged.<br><br>A second trial began that autumn. It lasted two weeks, resulting in acquittal for all defendants on 20 September.<br><br>They had been confident of victory, but were still relieved, said Mr Uwins, who remembers jurors hugging them outside court.<br><br>&quot;We felt triumphant. We felt we had achieved something and it was a message to the government that these field trials should not happen.&quot;<br><br>Co-defendant Nicole Sanderson, then 29, said the case forced the GM industry to &quot;sit up and take responsibility&quot;.<br><br>&quot;When you take part in an environmental action - and I&#x27;ve taken part in hundreds - you are trying to stop something you believe to be wrong. You don&#x27;t think about court and whether the 12 people of the jury agree with you,&quot; she said.</p>

    <p>&quot;Sometimes you are bringing the issue into the public eye, to right a wrong before it happens.<br><br>&quot;The jury had to listen to some very complex science; it was a massive case. If they had misunderstood any of it at any point they could have ruled against us.&quot;<br><br>The National Farmers&#x27; Union (NFU), however, described the acquittal as &quot;perverse&quot;.<br><br>&quot;This gives the green light to wanton vandalism and trespass,&quot; it was reported as writing to then Home Secretary Jack Straw.<br><br>Twenty years on, the NFU said in a statement that &quot;crop genetic improvement has been part of agriculture for hundreds of years&quot; but that the European Union had been &quot;discouraging in its approach to new food technologies&quot;.<br><br>It added: &quot;Access to modern biotechnology would enable British farmers to use resources more efficiently, remain competitive in a global market and deliver even more high quality and nutritious food for the public.&quot;<br><br>Another Norfolk farmer, David Hill, took part in a five-year cycle of GM crop trials, starting with sugar beet.<br><br>&quot;I&#x27;d seen the bad varieties of weed beet in the 1960s and this was an opportunity, in one fell swoop, to grow a greener and cleaner crop of sugar beet. The environmental benefits were immense,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;When I heard about the protest, I was bloody angry about it. We didn&#x27;t fear them coming: we had very good security and we worked within official guidelines.&quot;<br><br>Greenpeace was delighted with the acquittal, but when contacted this week, declined to comment, saying it had not run campaigns on GM crops for several years.<br><br>However, Liz O&#x27;Neill, director of the GM Freeze campaign group, said: &quot;These protests took place amid a headlong rush to release GMOs (genetically modified organisms) without proper testing, monitoring or the labelling that gives consumers a choice about what they are eating.<br><br>&quot;They helped bring the issue to the attention of politicians, regulators and the media resulting in the safety-first approach that has protected our food and our farms ever since.&quot;<br><br>Lord Melchett died in August 2018. In 2000, he appeared on Desert Island Discs, telling Sue Lawley: &quot;You only win a campaign if people support you and people will only support you if you&#x27;re right - if what you&#x27;re saying is correct or if what you predict turns out to be the case.&quot;<br><br>His daughter Jessie Mond Wedd, 39, said he was &quot;a wonderful dad, committed to environmentalism&quot;.<br><br>She said: &quot;He had a very individual way of looking at the world; he loved the outdoors and wildlife and felt a real sense of fear that it was in jeopardy&quot;<br><br>&quot;I often wonder what he would make of it all now, seeing the Extinction Rebellion movement enter mainstream consciousness.&quot;<br><br>The case inspired her to become a barrister, and she is now studying for a Masters in Environmental Law and Sustainable Development.<br><br>As for Mr Uwins, he has &quot;absolutely no regrets&quot; and feels &quot;immensely proud&quot; of his actions.<br><br>He now considers himself an &quot;armchair activist&quot;, but said: &quot;If the same thing happened again I would get my walking stick out of the cupboard and head straight up there.&quot;<br><br>Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
