    <p>Guerrilla &quot;subvertisers&quot; have launched a campaign of spoof adverts targeting BMW and Toyota, aiming to reveal the truth behind the carmakers&#x27; claims to be going green. As the European Motor Show opened in Brussels, climate activists hijacked more than 400 advertising billboards and bus stops in Belgium, France, Germany and England.<br><br>The posters were installed over the past few days by activists from Subvertisers International, Brandalism and Extinction Rebellion. Satirising the manufacturers&#x27; advertising messages, the billboards highlighted what activists describe as misleading adverts and aggressive lobbying tactics used by Toyota and BMW.<br><br>Spoof BMW adverts ran on the London underground and on bus stops showing a family of crash-test dummies surrounded by fumes, with the message: &quot;When we test our emissions, the test dummy – is you.&quot; In Brighton, a billboard was taken over by a vision of a cartoon climate dystopia, including dead animals, toxic waste and burning forests, with a Toyota 4x4 in the middle. The slogan read: &quot;Let&#x27;s ruin everything.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Tona Merriman, a spokesperson for Brandalism, said: &quot;Toyota have pushed their &#x27;Beyond Zero&#x27; sustainability adverts whilst lobbying governments around the world to weaken air quality plans and threatening legal action to protect their profits over a livable climate. Their adverts are duplicitous.&quot;<br><br>Brandalism said the pan-European subvertising actions were a call for greater government regulation of &quot;environmentally harmful products&quot; to prevent polluters making &quot;misleading green claims.&quot; Merriman added, &quot;Toyota and BMW use slick marketing campaigns to promote oversized SUV models that clog up urban neighbourhoods.&quot;<br><br>Both Toyota and BMW responded to the criticism, defending their environmental commitments and strategies for reducing emissions.</p>
