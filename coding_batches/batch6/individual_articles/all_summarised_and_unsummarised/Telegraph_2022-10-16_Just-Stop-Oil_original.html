        <h1>Just Stop Oil protesters spray paint over Aston Martin showroom and block Park Lane</h1><h2>Activists vow to ignore tougher penalties for breaching court injunctions as they glue themselves to the tarmac</h2><p>Activists from Just Stop Oil have vowed to ignore tougher penalties for breaching court injunctions as they sprayed orange paint over an Aston Martin car showroom on their 16th consecutive day of disruption.<br><br>The eco-campaigners sat in Park Lane in central London at 11am on Sunday, some gluing themselves to the tarmac or locking themselves together.<br><br>The group said it would ignore tough new penalties under the Public Order Bill set to go through Parliament on Tuesday.<br><br>Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary, has proposed to make it a criminal offence for people to carry glue with the intention of sticking themselves to highways or each other and they could face six months in jail.<br><br>She will also allow herself to apply for court injunctions to stop protests where it is in the public interest in a bid to &quot;streamline the process&quot;, a spokesman told The Telegraph. This previously had to be done by transport agencies.<br><br>She added: “I will not bend to protestors attempting to hold the British public to ransom. Preventing our emergency services from reaching those who desperately need them is indefensible and hideously selfish.”<br><br>More than 350 Just Stop Oil protestors, who are calling for the Government to halt all new oil and gas licences and consents, have been arrested in London since the start of October alone.<br><br>In a statement released on Sunday, Just Stop Oil said: &quot;We will not be intimidated by changes to the law, we will not be stopped by injunctions sought to silence nonviolent people. These are irrelevant when set against mass starvation, slaughter, the loss of our rights, freedoms and communities. The Home Secretary is demonstrating that politics is broken.&quot;<br><br>Photos and footage from the scene in Park Lane showed police officers trying to talk to those blocking the road while a cordon was set put up around the activists.<br><br>Chloe Thomas, 19, a pregnant mother and freelancer from Cannock who joined the action, said: &quot;How do I explain to my daughter in the years to come where the animals went, where the culture went, where the beauty went, why there are no bees and why I can&#x27;t put food in her tummy?</p><p>&quot;You know it&#x27;s bad, don&#x27;t you? As citizens, as humans, as parents and children we have a responsibility and a right under British law to protect ourselves and those we love.&quot;<br><br>Patrick Michael John McCarthy, 67, a carer from Telford, who was also at the protest, said: &quot;Please understand these actions are not easy for any of us.<br><br>&quot;It is uncomfortable, sometimes frightening and financially draining, so why do it. Because we have seen the devastating truth about the existential threats we face and cannot &#x27;unsee&#x27; that. The real question is why millions aren&#x27;t in civil resistance rather than why I am.&quot;<br><br>The action comes just days after Just Stop Oil protesters threw tins of tomato soup over Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers painting in the National Gallery and sprayed paint over the rotating New Scotland Yard sign.<br><br>The campaign group said it will also be protesting outside Downing Street every day in October.<br><br>Mel Carrington, of Just Stop Oil, told The Telegraph: &quot;It just shows the Government has lost the plot entirely; that they are on the back foot.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s inconceivable really that they would criminalise peaceful people who have a very reasonable demand which is don&#x27;t do things which are going to lead to mass starvation, slaughter and societal collapse so the idea that we represent a threat to law and order is laughable.<br><br>&quot;We are undeterred, we are carrying on, we are not going to be stopped by these threats. We are not going to be stopped or intimidated by changes to the law, and will carry on.&quot;<br><br>On Ms Braverman, she said: &quot;I feel she is out of her depth and at a loss and is lashing out. My feeling is that people are not going to be deterred by this, they will carry on because the alternative is so horrific and our demand is very reasonable.<br><br>&quot;I&#x27;ve no doubt that they will do it if they are still in power. That&#x27;s clearly the intention and we have already seen the tightening of the laws on protests against peaceful protesters.&quot;</p></body></html>
