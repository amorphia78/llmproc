    <p>&#x27;We are by far the most ecological, sustainable and new zero series that ever existed. We are pushing boundaries in every direction.&#x27;<br><br>Former race winner Robin Frijns was also confused by what he saw.<br><br>&#x27;I just cannot really get my head around those people, what they are thinking really,&#x27; two-time race winner Robin Frijns told The Race.<br><br>&#x27;We are here, Formula E is standing for helping the environment and then they do this. I don&#x27;t really understand.&#x27;<br><br>Race fans had a field day on Twitter roasting the activists.<br><br>&#x27;If you want to make your protest a joke, you do something like this,&#x27; wrote one user.<br><br>&#x27;Doing this at a formula e race is f***ing hilarious,&#x27; replied another.<br><br>&#x27;Do they know what the E stands for?&#x27; said a third.<br><br>The demonstration comes just days  after an activist from Just Stop Oil forced a World Championship snooker match to be cancelled after leaping on a table and throwing orange powder all over it.</p></body></html>
