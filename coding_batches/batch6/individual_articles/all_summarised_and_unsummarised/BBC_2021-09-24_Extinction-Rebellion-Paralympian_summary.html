    <p>A former Paralympic champion has been jailed for a year after gluing himself to the roof of a British Airways plane during an Extinction Rebellion protest. James Brown, who is visually impaired, climbed onto the Amsterdam-bound aircraft at London City Airport in October 2019. The 56-year-old glued his right hand to the plane and wedged his phone in the door to prevent it from closing.<br><br>Judge Gregory Perrins sentenced Brown to 12 months&#x27; imprisonment, of which he will serve half, at Southwark Crown Court. The judge stated, &quot;You cynically used your disability to put your plan into action,&quot; and added, &quot;The right to protest does not entitle you to cause major widespread disruption to a major airport... simply because you think it is the right thing to do.&quot;<br><br>Brown spent an hour on the aircraft before being removed. Prosecutors said he caused disruption to more than 300 British Airways passengers, costing the airline Â£40,000. The incident was part of a larger coordinated action, with the judge noting, &quot;This is a case in which you acted together with at least 10 other activists to plan and execute a major act of disruption.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Brown, who represented himself at trial, denied one count of causing a public nuisance, claiming he had &quot;to do something spectacular&quot; to draw attention to the climate crisis. He was found guilty in July after a jury deliberated for less than an hour.<br><br>The double gold medallist from Exeter had booked his flight on the morning of the stunt and had a bottle of superglue in his luggage that went undetected by security. Brown declined assistance from cabin staff, informing them of his intention to climb onto the roof of the plane.</p>
