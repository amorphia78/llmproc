    <p>Cameron Ford, an Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain activist, gained notoriety last month after spending his 31st birthday in a police cell for blocking roads on the M25. The carpenter from Whittlesford, Cambridge, remained unapologetic for the disruption to motorists, commenting at the time: &quot;I hope by causing disruption through civil disobedience that we can get our message across.&quot;<br><br>Mr Ford&#x27;s actions were part of a series of protests aimed at disrupting traffic on the M25 motorway. The protests were organized by Insulate Britain, a group demanding that the government insulate all social housing in Britain by 2025 and retrofit all homes with improved insulation by 2030.<br><br>However, new photos have emerged reportedly showing Mr Ford indulging in globe-trotting holidays across Canada and Europe. Photographs reveal the activist embarked on a four-month holiday across Canada in the autumn of 2019, potentially involving a round trip of 8,500 miles in flights. It is believed he travelled at least 1,500 miles within Canada during the jaunt, which could amount to a total of 10,000 miles travelled.</p>

    <p><br><br>When challenged by the Telegraph over his holidays, Mr Ford did not deny the existence of the photos. Speaking from atop the roof of a garden shed, Mr Ford told the Telegraph: &quot;If we start looking for anyone who is not a hypocrite we are not going to solve the problem. I am not perfect, I want a future that is liveable. This is not about me.&quot;<br><br>He claimed the photos published by the Mail Online were an attempt to &quot;demonise&quot; him. Mr Ford confirmed to the Telegraph he had travelled to Poland with his girlfriend to visit her family.<br><br>The article highlights the apparent contradiction between Mr Ford&#x27;s environmental activism and his personal travel habits, potentially undermining the credibility of his protests and the broader environmental movement.</p>
