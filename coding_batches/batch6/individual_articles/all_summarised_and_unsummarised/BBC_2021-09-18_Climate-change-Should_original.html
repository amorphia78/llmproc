        <h1>Climate change: Should green campaigners put more pressure on China to slash emissions?</h1>

    <p>China will be urged at the UN next week to speed up the timetable for curbing its planet-heating carbon emissions.<br><br>It will be nudged by the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who&#x27;s experiencing climate pressure himself from activists blocking motorways.<br><br>But is the UK, with its world-leading emissions targets, the right target for demonstrators?<br><br>China produces 28% of global emissions and the UK just 1%. So shouldn&#x27;t they be picketing the Chinese embassy instead of the M25 motorway?<br><br>On the face of it, that seems a reasonable question. And some veteran activists would indeed support a well-judged China protest - we&#x27;ll come to that later.<br><br>But when I initially asked the radical green group Extinction Rebellion (XR) if they had considered demonstrating against China, it triggered a furious response.<br><br>An XR member tweeted accusing me of perpetuating anti-Chinese racist stereotypes and failing to report climate change properly.<br><br>Why so vitriolic?<br><br>Well, there are two reasons. The first is practical: climate campaigning groups like Greenpeace and WWF have offices in Beijing and if they rattle China too hard, they could be swiftly closed down.<br><br>The second reason touches a sore spot on the geopolitical history of climate change. For the purposes of climate negotiations, China has been regarded as a developing country because major industrialisation occurred from the mid-20th Century - after some other countries.<br><br>Picketing the Chinese embassy would ostensibly transfer blame for the current crisis on to Beijing - while easing pressure for carbon cuts in historically wealthy nations such as the UK.<br><br>That&#x27;s exactly what some newspaper columnists want.<br><br>But it runs counter to global climate diplomacy, which acknowledges that it&#x27;s rich countries with a longer history of industrialisation that have caused most of the warming so far.<br><br>What&#x27;s more, much of the CO2 on China&#x27;s carbon accounts is created by manufacturing stuff that Western consumers buy.<br><br>So much stronger action from Beijing is certainly essential to prevent global heating getting even worse. But to be fair, China&#x27;s not quite as blameworthy as it seems.<br><br>The issue of fairness is embedded in international negotiations on climate action. During early talks in the 1990s, countries were divided into Annex 1 and Non-Annex 1.<br><br>Annex 1 - the rich nations and eastern Europe - agreed to take responsibility for their historic pollution by cutting emissions on home ground.<br><br>Non-Annex 1 - developing countries including (then) China agreed to begin reporting on their emissions - not cutting them - in return for financial aid.<br><br>Thanks to its turbo-charged economy China&#x27;s now emitting more CO2 than all rich nations put together, according to some estimates.<br><br>The total per person is still half that in the USA, but China&#x27;s overtaken the UK (if you don&#x27;t take into account the CO2 emitted manufacturing exported goods).<br><br>President Xi Jinping has offered to freeze emissions growth by 2030, but scientists say that&#x27;s not enough to evade deadly climate change.<br><br>In other words, China may consider it unfair to be expected to slash emissions at this stage of its economic growth - but if it doesn&#x27;t, the planet is in even more serious trouble.<br><br>This challenges the narrative of green groups, which have typically reserved their fire for the rich who caused the problem.</p>

    <p>In today&#x27;s dire circumstances, should they reconsider? I put the question to environment campaigners.<br><br>WWF chief executive Tanya Steele told me: &quot;As an organisation we support the right to protest. But we should focus on global collective responsibility - not on any single nation&quot;. WWF Beijing won&#x27;t exist if she appears anti-Chinese.<br><br>Neil Verlander from Friends of the Earth said: &quot;The UK government, with its historic contribution to climate change, is the focus of campaigning, as this is where we have the biggest influence.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We don&#x27;t have any plans to picket any embassies.&quot;<br><br>A spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion UK told me: &quot;We mustn&#x27;t allow those trying to frustrate action to use China as a scapegoat and further excuse their own responsibility.<br><br>&quot;However, if a local or affiliated group chose to protest against the Chinese government, if the conditions were appropriate then we might well support.&quot;<br><br>Some veteran activists and commentators think the green groups have gone soft.<br><br>They believe a strategic re-think is needed - but how can they exert pressure on China without giving succour to climate naysayers in the UK?<br><br>Journalist Geoffrey Lean, who pioneered environment reporting in the UK, shares one idea.<br><br>&quot;I would put small, polite pickets at every Chinese embassy worldwide. The Chinese authorities listen most to something coming from several different sources at the same time.<br><br>&quot;It would also preserve Chinese &quot;face&quot; more than a big single demonstration, and would almost certainly not make news - so it wouldn&#x27;t be picked up by the deniers.&quot;<br><br>Polite protest banners, he says, might appeal to Chinese pride with slogans such as &quot;China - please save the climate!&quot; or &quot;Great Helmsman, please cut emissions for our children.&quot;<br><br>This plan appealed to former Friends of the Earth founders Tom Burke and Jonathon Porritt.<br><br>Both agreed that green groups should protest against Chinese emissions.<br><br>Burke said: &quot;I would definitely campaign at the Chinese embassy. NGOs nowadays have grown fat and corporate. Sometimes they need to go back to basics.&quot;<br><br>Veteran Greenpeace strategist Chris Rose said: &quot;In the old days we didn&#x27;t do much more than biting ankles. But sometimes there&#x27;s a case for ankle-biting - and China is one exampleâ€¦ along with India.&quot;<br><br>Any action much be subtle, though, according to another long-standing independent campaigner, Cindy Baxter. She pointed out the President Xi had committed to strong action to curb coal power, but that provincial governments had ignored him.<br><br>She warned: &quot;If there was a blockade outside Chinese embassies, the right wing columnists would say &#x27;told you so&#x27;. That would be counter-productive. I would put a small picket out there - not a huge demonstration.&quot;<br><br>Whether or not the green groups decide to switch tactics, one thing is in no doubt - the world needs urgent emissions cuts from China - and indeed every other nation.<br><br>The website Climate Action Tracker estimates that global emissions in nine years&#x27; time are set to be roughly double the level required to meet the goal of holding the temperature rise to 1.5C.<br><br>And that&#x27;s when a temperature rise of just 1.1C has already been causing death and destruction.<br><br>Follow Roger on Twitter.</p>
