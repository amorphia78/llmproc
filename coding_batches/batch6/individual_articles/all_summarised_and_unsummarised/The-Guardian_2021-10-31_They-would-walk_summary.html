    <p>A group of about a dozen pilgrims from the female-run faith group Camino to Cop26 have completed a 500-mile walk from London to Glasgow for the Cop26 summit. The journey, which took 55 days, was part of a larger movement with approximately 250 individuals expected to arrive in Glasgow on foot from various parts of Europe.<br><br>The pilgrims, ranging from 18-year-old students to 74-year-old grandmothers, are part of Extinction Rebellion and aimed to raise awareness about the climate and ecological crisis along their route. They slept on floors of churches, village halls, and community centers, raising Â£17,000 to cover their costs and support climate activists in developing countries.<br><br>The group&#x27;s diverse backgrounds included devout Jews, Christians, Buddhists, and atheists. They carried minimal possessions in 10kg rucksacks and traveled with an electric van filled with lentils and rice. Along the way, they engaged in various activities, from joining samba players under Birmingham&#x27;s Spaghetti Junction to wild swimming.</p>

    <p><br><br>Rev Helen Burnett, a vicar who helped organize the pilgrimage, sees the journey as a way to fulfill her Christian calling to &quot;love thy neighbour&quot; and care for vulnerable people. She believes that walking and praying can help resolve issues and that people often find God in nature rather than in buildings.<br><br>The pilgrims received positive responses from communities they passed through, with some people applauding their efforts. Organizer Melanie Nazareth, a barrister, found inspiration in rural communities for sustainable living practices.<br><br>The arrival of these pilgrims in Glasgow is expected to mark the &quot;opening ceremony&quot; for nonviolent protests planned during the UN climate talks. This pilgrimage demonstrates a unique approach to climate activism, combining faith, physical endurance, and community engagement to draw attention to the urgent need for action on climate change.</p>
