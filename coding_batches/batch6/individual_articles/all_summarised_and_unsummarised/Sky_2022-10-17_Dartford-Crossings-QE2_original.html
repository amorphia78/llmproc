    <p>The Dartford Crossing bridge has been closed and there are long tailbacks after two oil protesters climbed the structure.<br><br>There are two-hour delays in both directions and five to six miles of congestion, said National Highways.<br><br>Climate change activist group Just Stop Oil said two of its supporters had scaled the 84m-high masts on the north side of the QE2 bridge &quot;to demand that the government halts all new oil and gas licences and consents&quot;.<br><br>It&#x27;s the latest protest by the group&#x27;s activists, who on Sunday sprayed an Aston Martin showroom with orange paint and a few days earlier threw tomato soup over Van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers.<br><br>&quot;The bridge has been closed while we resolve the incident which we will do as quickly and as safely for all involved,&quot; Essex Police said.<br><br>&quot;It does mean that we have had to close the bridge to traffic, but a diversion is going to be put in place through the tunnel.<br><br>&quot;This is likely to cause delays throughout this morning and this incident may take some time to resolve due to the complexities of safely getting people down from height.&quot;<br><br>The bridge, which links Essex and Kent, was shut after the report of climbers was received just before 3.50am. As daylight broke, they were pictured dangling from its steel cables.<br><br>The Dartford Crossing also includes two tunnels and is notoriously busy, being the only way to cross the Thames east of London by road.</p>

    <p>Engineer and protester Morgan Trowland, 39, released a statement through Just Stop Oil.<br><br>&quot;I can&#x27;t challenge this madness in my desk job, designing bridges, so I&#x27;m taking direct action, occupying the QE2 bridge until the government stops all new oil,&quot; he said.<br><br>Another protester, identified only as Marcus, 33, a teacher, said: &quot;Only direct action will now help to reach the social tipping point we so urgently need.&quot;<br><br>There was anger from drivers who faced long delays trying to get to work.<br><br>&quot;I&#x27;m currently sitting in traffic burning loads of fuel waiting to get on the Woolwich ferry to cross the Thames to get to workâ€¦. No thanks to the two d******** who have climbed the #darfordcrossing,&quot; tweeted Nick Reave.<br><br>&quot;My husband works for electricity board for London and can&#x27;t even get out our road,&quot; posted Sioxsie Wild.<br><br>&quot;He had VITAL engineering job to do. Ambulances are stuck and emergency services are stuck. This is causing more damage and literally harm to life.&quot;<br><br>Southbound/clockwise traffic is being diverted via the East Bore Tunnel, said National Highways. Traffic northbound/anti-clockwise is being confined to the West Bore Tunnel only.</p></body></html>
