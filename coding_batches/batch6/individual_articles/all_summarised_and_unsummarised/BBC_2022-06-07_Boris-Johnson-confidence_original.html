    <p>After winning a confidence vote called by Conservative MPs, the prime minister has called for MPs to &quot;draw a line under issues our opponents want to talk about&quot;.<br><br>With the political picture uncertain, residents in Nottingham gave their views on whether Boris Johnson should stay or go, and what the future holds for the UK.<br><br>Fiona McFarlane and Monica Pallis, both from West Bridgford, were in town as part of a long-running Extinction Rebellion protest against Barclays.<br><br>Both were heavily critical of the prime minister&#x27;s actions, and castigated the Conservatives for backing him for so long.<br><br>&quot;I think Mr Johnson has made an assault on democracy since he was elected, and by such dishonesty and by dismantling the checks on our democratic system he&#x27;s a danger to the country,&quot; said Ms McFarlane, 73, who runs her own small business.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s a shame on the Conservative party that they selected him in the first place, and they&#x27;ve allowed him to continue as he has.<br><br>&quot;He&#x27;s disgraced the role of prime minister.&quot;<br><br>Ms Pallis, 68, said the response from the Conservative party to partygate and other scandals had not been good enough.<br><br>&quot;Like most British people I believe in fairness, and we seem to be governed by people who have no idea what fairness is,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;They care only about their own interests.&quot;<br><br>Nottingham resident Peter Gordon also said it was time for Mr Johnson to be replaced.<br><br>&quot;At the end of the day, he has lied,&quot; the 53-year-old said.<br><br>&quot;Whenever I watch him, even when he apologises he does a smirk - he&#x27;s disingenuous.<br><br>&quot;He has done some good things, and you could argue Brexit was a good thing, but to be honest I don&#x27;t think he looked at all the consequences and we have suffered.<br><br>&quot;I think he&#x27;s got about a year - they will keep him until they start thinking about the next election.&quot;</p>

    <p>Enjoying an afternoon pint near Nottingham Castle - itself the site of a famous rebellion, when it was set on fire by rioters in 1831 - Gareth Bramley said it was time for Tories to back Mr Johnson.<br><br>The retired Nottingham resident said he did not follow politics much, but felt the prime minister &quot;comes across as a bit of a clown but has his heart in the right place&quot;.<br><br>&quot;I think he should stay, and anyone who was against him [in the confidence vote] should support him,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;I don&#x27;t vote any more because I got sick of politicians - they&#x27;re all a pain in the neck, they just oppose each other and bicker.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s the nature of the beast, the politicians do what they see fit at the time.<br><br>&quot;I didn&#x27;t need to be told they were breaking the rules, it was pretty obvious they were going to be doing that in some shape or form, and it wasn&#x27;t just the Conservatives.&quot;<br><br>For market stallholder Barry Anderssen, partygate and the subsequent confidence vote have only confirmed his lack of faith in the system.<br><br>&quot;I&#x27;m not really a fan of politicians - no matter what party they&#x27;re from they&#x27;re a bunch of liars,&quot; the 69-year-old said.<br><br>&quot;Nineteen years ago I moved here [to the UK], and I&#x27;ve given up hope. I thought they would be different here, but they&#x27;re not.<br><br>&quot;Partygate happened two years ago, you can&#x27;t change it, and I think it&#x27;s time to bury it and get on with more important things, like the war that&#x27;s going on [in Ukraine].<br><br>&quot;We&#x27;re supposed to be mature people, not children having a nibble at each other.&quot;<br><br>Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.
