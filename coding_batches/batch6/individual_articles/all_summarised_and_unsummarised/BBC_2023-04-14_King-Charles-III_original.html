    <p>A man who threw five eggs at King Charles during a visit to York has been found guilty of a public order offence.<br><br>Patrick Thelwell hurled the eggs towards the King and Queen Consort as they arrived at Micklegate Bar on 9 November. All five of the eggs missed.<br><br>The 23-year-old was found guilty after a trial at York Magistrates&#x27; Court.<br><br>Thelwell, who represented himself during the hearing, admitted throwing the eggs, but he claimed it was &quot;lawful violence&quot;.<br><br>Senior District Judge Paul Goldspring found the defendant guilty of threatening behaviour, saying he had &quot;intended to cause King Charles to believe immediate unlawful violence would be used against him&quot;.<br><br>Thelwell, who was a student at the University of York at the time of the offence, was given a 12-month community order with 100 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay costs of £600 and a £114 surcharge at a rate of £5 per week.<br><br>Michael Smith, prosecuting, said that as the eggs were thrown, Thelwell shouted offensive remarks about the King, which included accusing the monarch of being &quot;friends with Jimmy Savile&quot;.<br><br>He said Thelwell was also wearing high-heeled shoes and that he told police this allowed him to see the King through the crowd.<br><br>Body-worn camera footage of Thelwell&#x27;s arrest, which was played in court, showed Thelwell saying: &quot;I threw an egg at him because that&#x27;s what he deserved.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s the only justice victims of colonialism will get.&quot;<br><br>He also asked: &quot;Did I get him? Next time, someone will.&quot;<br><br>The court heard that Thelwell signed a custody form after his arrest with an obscenity and a drawing of an egg.<br><br>During the trial Thelwell asked Det Con Peter Wilson, giving evidence: &quot;Do you think throwing eggs is serious violence? More than the violence carried out by the British state?&quot;<br><br>Det Con Wilson said he did believe throwing eggs could be violent, but could not comment further.<br><br>Thelwell told the court his defence was &quot;that my actions towards the King were lawful violence rather than unlawful violence&quot;.</p>

    <p>He said he disputed the legitimacy of the court to try him as he said the Crown Prosecution Service worked for the monarchy and that he had &quot;acted out of necessity&quot;.<br><br>Thelwell criticised the UK&#x27;s asylum and climate policies, as well as social inequalities, which he said had been worsened by government policies.<br><br>&quot;Hundreds of people have contacted me to say they would have done the same thing and they would do the same thing if the King visited their community,&quot; he said.<br><br>Speaking outside York Magistrates&#x27; Court before the verdict, Thelwell had said he had &quot;no regrets and no apology to the King&quot;.<br><br>Sentencing Thelwell, senior district judge Paul Goldspring said: &quot;This was a gratuitous and pernicious act, particularly the pejorative comments made about the King.<br><br>&quot;But the level of violence I accept was low. This was an unprovoked, targeted act against what after all is a 74-year-old man.&quot;<br><br>Thelwell had arrived at court with a large bag, but the judge told him: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to send you to prison.&quot;<br><br>He said he instead planned to impose an unpaid work order and asked Thelwell: &quot;Do you want to say anything about that? Or are you are just relieved?&quot;<br><br>Thelwell laughed and said: &quot;Yes.&quot;<br><br>He added that he had recently given up his university studies which prompted the judge to ask Thelwell if he had the means to pay the £600 prosecution costs.<br><br>Thelwell told the court he had previously been self-employed and asked the judge: &quot;Do you need any gardening doing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Surprisingly not,&quot; the judge replied.<br><br>The court heard that Thelwell had two previous convictions for public order offences relating to his participation in Extinction Rebellion protests.<br><br>Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
