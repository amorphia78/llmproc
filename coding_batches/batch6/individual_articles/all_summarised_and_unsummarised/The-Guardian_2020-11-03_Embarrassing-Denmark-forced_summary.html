        <h1>‘Embarrassing’: Denmark forced to U-turn on meat ban for state canteens</h1><p>The Danish government has reversed its ban on state canteens serving meat for two days every week after a backlash from employees. Officials had proposed to introduce two vegetarian days a week in the canteens, as well as limiting beef or lamb to once a week. However, trade union objections forced a U-turn on the policy after barely a week.<br><br>The government has now said it would be up to individual workplaces to decide whether or not to introduce meat-free days. Denmark had been attempting to make reductions in the nation&#x27;s diet-related footprint to help meet its ambitious new climate targets. Last year it approved a new climate law to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030.<br><br>Anne Paulin, climate spokesperson for the ruling Social Democrats, said the Danish government had not wanted to ban meat consumption, but to &quot;set an example on greener eating habits&quot;. Paulin said a more &quot;pragmatic solution&quot; of voluntary meat-free days had now been agreed. &quot;We still believe people will eat meat in the future, but we should eat less for climate and health reasons,&quot; she added.</p>

    <p><br><br>Greenpeace said the government&#x27;s U-turn on meat-free days was &quot;embarrassing&quot; and that it was now also likely to back away from initiating the necessary transition in Danish agriculture. Helene Hagel, head of climate and environmental policy at Greenpeace Denmark, stated, &quot;It needs to start talking about the elephant in the room, the fact that Denmark is the biggest meat producer in the world, per capita, with 28% of Danish climate emissions coming from the production of meat and dairy products.&quot;<br><br>The Danish food industry said the meat-free proposals were &quot;not necessarily beneficial&quot; in reducing climate emissions. Niels Peter Nørring, climate director at the Danish Agriculture and Food Council, expressed concerns about the potential substitution of Danish food products with less climate-efficient imported alternatives.</p></body></html>
