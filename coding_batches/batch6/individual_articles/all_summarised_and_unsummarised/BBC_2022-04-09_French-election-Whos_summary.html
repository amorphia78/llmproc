    <p>Twelve candidates are vying for the French presidency, with incumbent Emmanuel Macron seeking a second term. Voters will cast their ballots in the first round on Sunday, with a potential run-off on April 24 if no candidate secures a majority.<br><br>Macron, who became France&#x27;s youngest president in 2017 at age 39, continues to dominate French politics but faces strong competition from far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. The 44-year-old president is proposing full employment within five years, tax cuts, and gradually raising the retirement age from 62 to 65.<br><br>Le Pen, 53, is Macron&#x27;s closest rival and runner-up in the 2017 election. She has rebranded her National Front party as National Rally and crafted a consistent anti-immigration, anti-EU message that resonates with disaffected voters. Le Pen promises to halt abuse of the right to asylum, ban the Islamic hijab in public areas, and transform the EU into an alliance of nations unchallenged by EU laws.</p>

    <p><br><br>Other notable candidates include Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a veteran left-wing agitator who supports high spending and sweeping constitutional reform, and Valérie Pécresse, the first female presidential candidate for the right-wing Les Républicains party.<br><br>The election has been overshadowed by Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine, but for most voters, the main issue is the cost of living. Macron&#x27;s poll ratings were initially boosted by his diplomatic efforts during the conflict, but voters are more concerned with increasing bills.<br><br>As the campaign enters its final days, opinion polls suggest Le Pen has narrowed Macron&#x27;s lead and could pose a significant challenge in a potential run-off on April 24.</p>
