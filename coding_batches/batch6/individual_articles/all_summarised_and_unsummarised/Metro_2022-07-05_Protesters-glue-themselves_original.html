        <h1>Protesters glue themselves to The Last Supper painting at Royal Academy</h1><p>Just Stop Oil protesters have glued themselves to a sixteenth century painting at London’s Royal Academy in protest against climate inaction.<br><br>Campaigners glued their hands to the frame of a copy of Leonardo Da Vinci’s The Last Supper, attributed to one of the artist’s pupils, Giampietrino.<br><br>The group have been targeting the art world to pressure it into doing more to address the climate crisis and the continued production of fossil fuels.<br><br>Protesters said they chose The Last Supper because people around the world are currently experiencing a food crisis caused in part by rising global temperatures.<br><br>Jessica Agar, 21 an art student from Hereford said: ‘No sculpture can feed babies starving because extreme heat killed food crops. Nurses are lining up outside food banks, not galleries.<br><br>‘If the directors of this gallery really believe that art has the power to change the world then I demand that they claim that power, close and refuse to open until the government commits to no new oil.’<br><br>Five activists stuck themselves to the frame of the painting on Tuesday morning, after spraying ‘no new oil’ on the wall below it.<br><br>Within minutes of the stunt, security guards ushered visitors and journalists out of the room and called the police.</p>
