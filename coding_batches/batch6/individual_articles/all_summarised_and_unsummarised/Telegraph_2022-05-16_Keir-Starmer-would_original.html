        <h1>Keir Starmer would be admitting total defeat if he joined a silly 'progressive pact'</h1><h2>Imagine that: a supposed party of government standing down candidates in favour of other parties. Labour would be foolish to entertain it</h2><p>A new survey has concluded that a pre-election formal pact involving the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens would pave the way for an anti-Conservative coalition that wouldn’t even have to rely on the SNP to govern. If it sounds too good to be true, then there may be a simple reason for that. But we’ll come to it later.<br><br>First, we should take note of the identity of the organisation that has come to this not-particularly-surprising conclusion. Best for Britain was set up in 2017 to campaign to prevent the result of the previous year’s EU referendum being honoured. Having failed in that ambition of dubious democratic credentials, it then morphed into a broader campaign to preserve and strengthen Britain’s links with the EU. Its aims do not yet include rejoining the EU (and in that sentence, “yet” is doing a lot of heavy lifting).<br><br>So it is worth asking: would Best for Britain have released with such fanfare the results of a survey which showed, contrary to their aims, that a formal pact of “progressive” parties would not deliver the knock-out blow to Boris Johnson’s Conservatives?<br><br>The big news story seems to be that a Labour-led coalition would be able to govern without the help of SNP MPs, and so would not be under any obligation to concede a second independence referendum in exchange for votes in the Commons. In 2015, the prospect of a Labour government being held hostage by a large nationalist contingent helped the Conservatives destroy Ed Miliband’s ambitions to lead the country.<br><br>So why would Labour agree to stand aside candidates in favour of Green candidates (for that is the hope of Best for Britain) when the Greens in Scotland support independence as enthusiastically as the SNP? In fact, when Nicola Sturgeon gave ministerial jobs to two Green MSPs last year, the UK Greens welcomed the development with “delight and excitement”, even as it breathlessly listed “preparing a joint bill on a new referendum on independence for Scotland” as one of the main aims of their new government friends.<br><br>It would be ridiculous therefore to assume that engaging with the Greens will in any way strengthen the Union.<br><br>More importantly – and the reason why Best for Britain’s ambitions for our electoral future are likely to be dashed – is that Labour is being invited to do two entirely contradictory things.<br><br>It will, of course, as all opposition parties do, insist that it can win the next election on its own, that it is heading to majority government. But the party is also being asked to take a step that would, by definition, be an admission of defeat. “Yes, we’re confident we’ll win the next election outright, and to that end we’re standing down Labour candidates across the country because they can’t win.” Too wordy for an election leaflet, perhaps?</p><p>Agreeing to Best for Britain’s cynical old tactic would do nothing more than confirm in voters’ minds that Labour still hasn’t cracked the problem of appealing to them.<br><br>And make no mistake: the Lib Dems and the Greens, across a series of issues, are Labour’s opponents. The country’s sole Green MP, Caroline Lucas, was elected on the same day that the last Labour government was removed from office. Had she been elected five years earlier, there can be no doubt that she would have voted against Labour in the Commons on far more occasions than she would have supported them. While the Lib Dems established their taste for political pragmatism by their decision to usher in more than a decade of Conservative rule by agreeing to David Cameron’s request for a coalition, the Greens remain unreconstructed oppositionists. The notion that they could be relied upon to support a minority Labour administration, with all the compromises and concessions such a role would entail, is fanciful to say the least.<br><br>A consequence for Labour of publicly stating its preference for a broad coalition with the Greens and the Lib Dems would be a free-for-all by the media. How many Green candidates will have expressed something in their social media accounts that would embarrass Starmer on the campaign trail? How many bare knuckle fights would the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, have with ostensible allies in the Green movement over the latter’s ideological insistence that “trans women are women” and that anyone who demurs from that assertion is transphobic?<br><br>What will Labour spokespeople say when their putative coalition partners insist that Extinction Rebellion are entirely right to prevent people going to their work or to hospital because the right to protest must always trump the right to travel? By inviting voters to support candidates who agree with that view?<br><br>Best for Britain have not outlined a strategic way forward for Britain’s progressive parties; they have indulged in a fantasy that would result only in a chaotic (though admittedly entertaining) political circus.<br><br>But the best reason to reject their approach? They offer an apparently easy path to government. Yet winning elections is not an easy task, and neither should it be. Labour can only succeed if it’s willing to reform and, crucially, if it is willing to counter the demands of those who claim to be allies but who are most decidedly not.</p></body></html>
