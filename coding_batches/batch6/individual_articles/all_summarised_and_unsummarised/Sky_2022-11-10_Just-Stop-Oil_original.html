        <h1>Just Stop Oil protester defends M25 disruption: 'Birds are falling out of the sky, pensioners are dying'</h1><h2>Campaigner Indigo Rumbelow, in a tense exchange with Sky News' Mark Austin, argues that protests causing widespread disruption should and will continue until the government issues a statement to stop new licences for oil and gas.</h2><p>A Just Stop Oil campaigner has defended protests blocking the M25 for a fourth day, warning that &quot;this is just the beginning&quot;.<br><br>In a fiery exchange with Sky News&#x27; Mark Austin, Indigo Rumbelow insisted the climate crisis is set to get &quot;worse and worse and worse unless we act.&quot;<br><br>Appearing on The News Hour With Mark Austin, Ms Rumbelow described the situation as &quot;incredibly grave&quot; and said Just Stop Oil has one simple demand - for the government to stop licencing new gas and oil in the UK.<br><br>&quot;We need everybody to come and join us so that we don&#x27;t have to cause this type of disruption on the motorways,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;We need to be sat outside parliament with tens and tens of thousands of people demanding an end to new oil and gas.&quot;<br><br>Ms Rumbelow added: &quot;It is very clear the disruption will end as soon as the government issue a statement to stop new oil and gas.<br><br>&quot;Protests will have to continue because, at the moment, I just do not know what else we&#x27;re going to do.&quot;<br><br>The campaigner was interviewed as police forces scramble to deal with demonstrations which have caused severe delays on Britain&#x27;s busiest motorway.<br><br>The actions of protesters have been branded &quot;criminal, reckless and dangerous&quot; by Essex Police Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who warned it is &quot;only a matter of time&quot; before someone gets killed.</p><p>He spoke out after a police officer was injured in a collision between two lorries while responding to a protest on the M25.<br><br>Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player<br><br>But when asked about whether Just Stop Oil&#x27;s message is getting &quot;lost&quot; in angry debate about their methods, Ms Rumbelow said: &quot;The climate crisis is disrupting people around the world right now and even here in the UK this summer we saw the effects of the climate crisis.<br><br>&quot;With the UK getting 40C heat and birds falling out of the sky and pensioners dying before they should.<br><br>&quot;This isn&#x27;t an issue of just green policy or just the climate protesters, it&#x27;s an issue that&#x27;s going to impact you, it&#x27;s going to impact me, it&#x27;s going to impact your children if you have children, and it&#x27;s impacting people around the world, so our government&#x27;s decision to go ahead with new oil and gas with the full knowledge that this will kill millions of people is a complete act of betrayal on my generation.&quot;</p></body></html>
