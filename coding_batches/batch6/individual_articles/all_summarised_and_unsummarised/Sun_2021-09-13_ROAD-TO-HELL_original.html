    <p>&quot;They need to face up to reality. It will destroy our economy and the fabric of our society.<br><br>&quot;They are being incredibly reckless. They are betting the farm on technologies that don&#x27;t exist.<br><br>â€‹&quot;As soon as a statement is made that we can trust and is meaningful we will get off the roads.&quot;<br><br>I am seething at how irresponsible and selfish their demonstration is.<br><br>Steve Gower, 54, unemployed, currently living in fuel poverty in Gloucester added: &quot;Man up Johnson and get on with it.&quot;<br><br>In total, 92 people are known to have been arrested so far.<br><br>The Met Police has made 14 arrests, cops in Essex have arrested 12, Hertfordshire officers are quizzing 18 people, Surrey Police are holding 36 protesters and 12 have been detained in Kent.<br><br>Essex Police Chief Inspector Paul Austin said: &quot;This incident caused significant disruption and our officers worked to resolve it as quickly and safely as possible.<br><br>&quot;I want to thank the drivers affected for their patience and understanding.&quot;<br><br>AA president Edmund King said: &quot;This action is not only incredibly dangerous in potentially putting lives at risk but it also backfires in environmental terms by causing more delays and more vehicle emissions.<br><br>&quot;These are some of the busiest sections of the M25 where tens of thousands of drivers will have been affected and has a negative knock-on effect on economic activity.&quot;<br><br>A National Highways spokesperson warned there was congestion on the roundabout at Junction 3, while the clockwise exit slip at Junction 14 was closed.<br><br>The northbound exit slip at Junction 31 is also closed, as is the exit slip to Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 at Junction 14.<br><br>Officials advised drivers to find alternative routes.</p>
