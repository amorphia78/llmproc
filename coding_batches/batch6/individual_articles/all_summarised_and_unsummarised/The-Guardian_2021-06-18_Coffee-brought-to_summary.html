        <h1>Coffee brought to you by coal: a week in the life of Australiaâ€™s acting prime minister</h1><p>Michael McCormack, Australia&#x27;s acting prime minister, has made several controversial statements during his week at the helm. Known for his provocative remarks, McCormack didn&#x27;t disappoint this time, focusing his ire on environmental activists and inner-city residents.<br><br>In one of his most notable quotes, McCormack defended the coal industry, stating, &quot;[Coal] pays for a lot of hospitals. It pays for a lot of schools. It pays for a lot of barista machines that produce the coffee inner-city types sit around and drink and talk about the death of coal.&quot; This comment came in response to discussions about coal&#x27;s demise by G7 nation leaders, including Joe Biden and Boris Johnson.<br><br>McCormack also targeted environmental groups, particularly the Greens and Extinction Rebellion protesters. He accused the Greens of wanting to &quot;upturn regional communities&quot; and &quot;destroy the social fabric of society.&quot; His criticism extended to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) regarding their stance on the ongoing mouse plague in Australia.</p>

    <p><br><br>In a particularly contentious moment, McCormack called Adam Bandt, the member for Melbourne, &quot;treasonous&quot; and an &quot;absolute traitor&quot; for allegedly writing to foreign ambassadors to deny Australian trade. This comment was immediately withdrawn due to its legal implications.<br><br>Throughout his tenure as acting PM, McCormack consistently portrayed a divide between rural and urban Australia, often referring negatively to &quot;inner-city types&quot; and their perceived disconnect from regional issues. His statements reflect a staunch defense of traditional industries and a skepticism towards environmental concerns, maintaining the tone he has become known for in Australian politics.</p></body></html>
