        <h1>Longer jail terms donâ€™t stop crime, admits Chris Philp, justice minister</h1><p>A justice minister has admitted there is little evidence that longer sentences help to cut crime, despite his own department introducing laws yesterday to increase jail terms.<br><br>Chris Philp, the minister responsible for sentencing, said that detailed research had found that the likelihood of being caught and punished was much more important in discouraging people from committing crime than the length of jail sentences.<br><br>Answering a parliamentary question about the deterrent effect of longer sentences, he said: &quot;The evidence is mixed, although harsher sentencing tends to be associated with limited or no general deterrent effect. Increases in the certainty of apprehension and punishment have consistently been found to have a deterrent effect.&quot;<br><br>The comments from Philp put him at odds with measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that will impose longer sentences for a variety of offences.<br><br>The Ministry of Justice insisted that its increased sentences were meant to protect the public and punish perpetrators rather than act as deterrents. A source from the ministry said: &quot;Sentencing isn&#x27;t all about deterrence. People who are in prison don&#x27;t pose a threat to the public and a strong punitive element to sentencing is crucial in maintaining public confidence in the criminal justice system.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Prison reform campaigners welcomed Philp&#x27;s comments and questioned why his department was going ahead with its plans for longer sentences, which they argued would only place further pressure on Britain&#x27;s creaking prisons system.<br><br>Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, has defended the changes and insisted that the tougher sentences at the top end would be balanced with &quot;smarter ones at the lower end&quot;.<br><br>A government spokesman said: &quot;We make no apologies for prioritising public protection by ensuring serious and dangerous offenders are off our streets for longer. At the same time, our 20,000 extra police will help to deter criminals and significantly reduce their chances of evading justice.&quot;</p></body></html>
