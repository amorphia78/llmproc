    <p>Nearly 40 years ago, Greenham Common in Berkshire was the site of the world&#x27;s longest-running anti-nuclear demonstration, the Women&#x27;s Peace Camp. The protest began in September 1981 when 36 members of a peace movement called Women for Life on Earth arrived at the gates after a 120-mile march from Cardiff. Their numbers soon swelled to 30,000, united in protest against Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s plans to bring American cruise missiles to Britain.<br><br>Three sisters from the Welsh Valleys - Susan Lamb, Lesley Brinkworth, and Christine King - were among the protesters. Susan, then a housewife from the Rhondda, recalls, &quot;I was just a housewife from the Rhondda, terrified what could happen to our children. We had to stand up for what we believed in.&quot;<br><br>The women faced significant challenges during their protest. They were jailed, threatened by anti-protest vigilantes, and even took US President Ronald Reagan to court. Lesley admits, &quot;I was a different person at Greenham. We learned to face our fears and that if people come together we can change the world.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The protesters lived in cars and tents at Greenham Common, without electricity or running water. In 1982, the sisters were part of a group of 23 women who stormed the entrance of the base and were jailed for 14 days for breaching the peace. In 1983, thousands of women formed a human chain around the airfield in an &quot;Embrace the Base&quot; demonstration.<br><br>The protest had a significant impact. Susan states, &quot;Our pressure forced the Government&#x27;s arm, no doubt about it. We had won.&quot; In 1989, the missiles began leaving Greenham Common. The sisters hope their actions will inspire future generations of activists against new world threats like climate change.</p>
