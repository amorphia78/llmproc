        <h1>The Lorax review — this stripped-back musical falls flat</h1><h2>Old Vic, streaming</h2><p>★★☆☆☆I’d better start by confessing that I’ve never much cared for the stories of Dr Seuss. He may be one of the patron saints of children’s literature in the US, but his relentlessly convoluted, wibbly-wobbly verse never appealed to me as a child. I hardly ever read his tales to my sons either.<br><br>So I’m not exactly the target audience for the Old Vic’s live-streamed revival of David Greig and Charlie Fink’s musical version of the ecologically conscious tale, first published 50 years ago, about an eccentric creature trying to save an idyllic landscape from the ravages of industrialism. Most reviewers, however, had kind words for the 2015 premiere. Indeed the Old Vic’s artistic director, Matthew Warchus, describes The Lorax as “one of the best shows I’ve ever seen”.<br><br>Not having seen the original production, all I can say is that this stripped-down version — directed by Max Webster — falls very flat. The gospel-tinged songs seldom take flight, the visuals are dowdy and uninspired. The Old Vic is a wonderfully atmospheric venue, but here the backdrop of the empty auditorium is so dim, dark and cramped that the show might as well be taking place in somebody’s attic.<br><br>There’s a bigger problem too. Dr Seuss’s tale takes all of five minutes to read. Greig and Fink have tried to flesh it out to about an hour and a half, but the script is woefully undernourished. The villain of the piece remains the oddly named entrepreneur, the Once-ler, and we now see more of the members of his charmless family, while the animals who have to live amid the smog and detritus of his factory band together to create a protest for the news cameras.</p>

    <p>Even so, we’re still left with a spectacle that runs out of juice long before the interval. Jamael Westman makes the best of the cardboard role of the Once-ler, but anyone looking forward to seeing Audrey Brisson — so beguiling in the stage musical version of that whimsical French film Amélie — will feel short-changed. She flits on and off screen, but spends a good part of the time as one of no fewer than three puppeteers operating the modestly proportioned Lorax. The split-screen effects are cheap and cheerful at best.<br><br>Yes, the whole enterprise has its heart in the right place. (There will be free recorded screenings for schools in celebration of Earth Day on April 22.) Criticising a show of this kind is a little like throwing rotten eggs at Greta Thunberg. Still, save your money and give it to Greenpeace instead.To April 17, oldvictheatre.com<br><br>Follow @timesarts on Twitter to read the latest theatre reviews</p></body></html>
