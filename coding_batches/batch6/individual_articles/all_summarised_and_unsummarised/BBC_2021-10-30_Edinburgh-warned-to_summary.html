    <p>Edinburgh residents are being cautioned to expect disruption as the city prepares to accommodate a significant portion of COP26 attendees. About 5,000 delegates, a fifth of the total invited, will be staying in the capital and commuting to the Glasgow venue, putting added pressure on the city&#x27;s transport system.<br><br>ScotRail has bolstered its service between Edinburgh and Glasgow, operating trains with maximum eight carriages and introducing more late-night services. However, passengers are urged to plan ahead and check their journeys, as trains are expected to be busy.<br><br>Commuters should also anticipate disruption on Edinburgh&#x27;s roads. The opening days of the conference will feature motorcades of world leaders and their entourages traveling through the city en route to Glasgow. Drivers will have to stop and wait as these VIPs move through.<br><br>Sarah Boyd, operations director for Lothian Buses, explained that they will do their best to keep people informed about delays. &quot;We expect there will be disruption and we&#x27;re going to do our best to cope with that,&quot; she said, advising people to plan ahead and leave extra time for their journeys.</p>

    <p><br><br>Planned protests, such as Extinction Rebellion&#x27;s march from the Meadows to the Scottish Parliament, will further contribute to restricted movement around Edinburgh. Activists have also promised &quot;non-violent direct action&quot; during the climate conference, potentially causing additional disruption.<br><br>Cammy Day, deputy leader of Edinburgh Council, acknowledged the challenges ahead: &quot;With thousands more people coming to the city there will be some disruption.&quot; He encouraged residents to stay informed about potential closures and to participate in COP26 by reducing their carbon footprint or attending events in Edinburgh or Glasgow.</p>
