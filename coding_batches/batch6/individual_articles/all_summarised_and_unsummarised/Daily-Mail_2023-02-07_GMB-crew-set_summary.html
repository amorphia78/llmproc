    <p>Susanna Reid was yet again let down by the Good Morning Britain TV crew, after they set her up for another embarrassing mistake live on air. This comes only days after she was said to have been left &#x27;furious&#x27; when a string of errors were made on the show.<br><br>A voice-over announcement read: &#x27;You&#x27;re watching Good Morning Britain on Friday the third of February.&#x27; It was, however, Monday the sixth. This time, a puzzled Susanna, 52, and co-host Ben Shephard, 48, were able to laugh off the calendar gaffe.<br><br>But the blunder has reportedly added to fears among executives that embarrassing mistakes will keep on happening. A show insider told The Sun: &#x27;Susanna and Ben were stunned, especially after last week&#x27;s mishaps. To get the date of the show wrong is pretty poor by anybody&#x27;s standards — it was the worst possible start to the week. She&#x27;s let this one go, with a few eye rolls, but they keep happening.&#x27;</p>

    <p><br><br>Another said: &#x27;It&#x27;s actually really sad — the production team seem totally incapable. They just seem overwhelmed.&#x27;<br><br>Last week, the broadcaster allegedly &#x27;made her feelings very clear&#x27; and confronted senior executives after a series of blunders made their way into the live broadcast. Spelling mistakes, wrong dates and graphic mis-designs have all slipped through during live broadcasts of the show in recent weeks, leaving the host allegedly embarrassed.<br><br>A source told The Sun: &#x27;She made her feelings very clear, and confronted the senior executives over it. Susanna is totally professional and just wants high standards — as Piers or any other presenter would have done. The last thing anyone wants is her walking away in anger.&#x27;<br><br>Susanna doesn&#x27;t appear to be the only one aggravated by the gaffes, as some viewers took to Twitter during the live morning shows to highlight GMB&#x27;s mistakes.</p>
