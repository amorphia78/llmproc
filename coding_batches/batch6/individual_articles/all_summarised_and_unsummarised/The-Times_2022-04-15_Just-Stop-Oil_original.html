        <h1>Just Stop Oil protester: I don’t care if I’m the most hated man in Britain — I’ll ruin my life to give others a future</h1><p>After 17 arrests and a prison spell to his name over the past year for his part in a wave of climate protests, Louis McKechnie could question whether his actions are worthwhile.<br><br>Yet rather than stepping back, the Just Stop Oil activist has announced a willingness to become “the most hated man in the UK” if it helps to achieve the group’s goals.<br><br>The 21-year-old is one of the most prominent figures in the group that has been targeting oil plants and tankers since the beginning of the month, causing traffic disruption and fuel shortages in some areas.<br><br>His notoriety was secured last month when he ran on to the pitch during a Premier League football match between Everton and Newcastle United, attaching his neck to a goalpost with a cable tie.<br><br>As he struggled to breathe, to the jeers of thousands, one fan was captured brandishing a knife at McKechnie and another managed to evade guards before kicking him in the head.<br><br>The former engineering student at Bournemouth University says that he is still struggling to get over the overwhelming experience, which saw him charged with pitch encroachment and aggravated trespass.<br><br>Yet despite acknowledging that the protest “wasn’t exactly a day out in the park”, the activist has returned to the front line this month and been taken into police custody another three times.<br><br>McKechnie says climate activists are undertaking the controversial protests in an attempt to force firmer action by Boris Johnson, whom he accuses of “green-washing” by launching soft-touch climate policies.<br><br>“It’s quite traumatising to actually have to keep doing it,” he said. “I’m throwing away my own future at the expense of everybody else’s.<br><br>“I can’t do this and study. And with a criminal record I can’t get a job. I’m not going to be able to do a lot of normal life things after this.<br><br>“But it is a trade-off I am willing to make because if we don’t make this trade-off then we die. I’d much rather I don’t have a future than everybody I love not have a future.”<br><br>McKechnie says that the publicity from the football protest has led to him being recognised in public, which he describes as a nuisance when carrying out reconnaissance trips at potential protest sites.<br><br>Just Stop Oil, which is affiliated with the Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain groups, wants the government to stop all future licensing and consent for fossil fuel production and exploration.<br><br>It says that political decisions taken over the next four years will determine the future of the planet.<br><br>While the group’s “guerrilla tactics” have been condemned by the Conservatives and Labour, McKechnie has won the backing of high-profile figures such as Gary Lineker.<br><br>McKechnie’s life of activism began young, growing up in Weymouth, partly inspired by his mother, the Dorset Green Party councillor Clare Sutton, whom he accompanied to a palm oil protest at the age of ten.<br><br>He set up an Extinction Rebellion group at his university in 2019, initially confining his activism to marches and talks.<br><br>His first arrest came in April 2021, when he carried out a one-person roadblock in Bournemouth — before which he had to run to a café to vomit because of nerves.<br><br>McKechnie then transferred his allegiance to the Animal Rebellion group and was arrested four times in eight days last August, including for dying the fountains outside Buckingham Palace blood red.<br><br>He then joined Insulate Britain and was sentenced to prison on his 21st birthday last November as part of the “Highway Nine” group who broke a court order banning them from blocking the M25.<br><br>As he was led into the HMP Thameside category B prison, McKechnie — who has been likened to John Lennon because of his curtained haircut — said he feared the worst.<br><br>“The first prisoners came up and said, ‘We know why you’re here’,” he said. “I thought I was going to get killed but they told me that they had kids and were also worried and appreciated what I was doing.</p>

    <p>“That basically set the scene. I had gangsters coming up to me paying their respects and never once did I feel unsafe. It was a real novelty to them.”<br><br>He said his cellmate Keith, a burglar who was serving a fifth prison sentence, stole library books for him during the six-week stay.<br><br>After his release on New Year’s Eve, McKechnie said he was “empowered to do more” and joined Just Stop Oil two days later, while keeping in touch with some of his old prison friends.<br><br>He was among a group of protesters who spent 40 hours chained to pipework ten metres above the loading bay at the Inter Terminal in Grays, Essex, before being arrested on Monday.<br><br>The once “shy” schoolboy has quit his university course to focus on protesting. He believes he and his 19-year-old sister will not “live to have grey hair” if government climate policy is not radically strengthened, pointing to recent Tory opposition to onshore wind farms.<br><br>Of the group’s ongoing action, he said: “We weren’t expecting the public to like us, we were expecting we might be public enemy number one. That’s basically happened and we are ok with that.<br><br>“I would be ok with being the most hated man in the country if it means protecting my loved ones and the future of my generation in this country and all around the world.”<br><br>His willingness to find himself in handcuffs is in stark contrast to Miranda Whelehan, 21, a fellow protester whose appearance on Good Morning Britain went viral this week.<br><br>The University of Sussex student was praised after her questioning by the presenter Richard Madeley, who said the group’s slogan was “playground-ish” and like something said by the Little Britain character Vicky Pollard.<br><br>Madeley was accused of bullying and patronising his guest, who tried to respond by setting out her concerns about climate change.<br><br>Since being taken back to her Brighton home by her “really proud” mother who was watching off-screen, Whelehan has been holed up working on end-of-year university work.<br><br>Although largely unaware of the social media reaction, the Harry Potter fan was delighted to hear that the actor Bonnie Wright, who plays Ginny Weasley in the films, had backed her.<br><br>Whelehan described the TV experience as “infuriating”, saying that she felt Madeley and the other guests wanted her to spend the duration of the segment “arguing and being rude”.<br><br>“I think it’s important to try to say the facts or at least something rational,” she told The Times, adding that she would be unlikely to be interviewed by somebody unwilling to admit the scale of the climate crisis again.<br><br>https://www.thetimes.com/article/just-stop-oil-activists-cause-fuel-shortage-6cfppsrwf • Just Stop Oil activists wrong to disrupt people’s lives, says George Eustice<br><br>The student of international development and French grew up in Weybridge, Surrey. She was arrested for the first time in her life during Extinction Rebellion protests in central London last August.<br><br>She spent the night in Charing Cross police station, which she described as “not a pleasant experience at all” before being released without charge.<br><br>The activist was among protesters who launched Just Stop Oil’s spell of disruption by clambering aboard tankers at the Navigator Oil terminal in Essex on April 1.<br><br>Although she does not regret taking part, believing radical demonstrations are pivotal to garnering widespread attention, Whelehan said she was unsure about whether to join future protests, describing them as “quite intense”.<br><br>“I don’t like that there’s so much disruption caused [by the protests] and that people get angry and say horrible things,” she said. “I don’t really want to be in the position of receiving that.<br><br>“But what is happening to our planet is so monumental and I think ‘if we don’t stand up and say something then what are we doing’.”</p></body></html>
