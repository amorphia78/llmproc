    <p>Susanna Reid was yet again let down by the Good Morning Britain TV crew, after they set her up for another embarrassing mistake live on air.<br><br>This comes only days after she was said to have been left &#x27;furious&#x27; when a string of errors were made on the show.<br><br>But unfortunately for Susanna, the saga is ongoing after they started this week in a similar vein.<br><br>A voice-over announcement read: &#x27;You&#x27;re watching Good Morning Britain on Friday the third of February.&#x27; It was, however, Monday the sixth.<br><br>This time, a puzzled Susanna, 52, and co-host Ben Shephard, 48, were able to laugh off the calendar gaffe.<br><br>But the blunder has reportedly added to fears among executives that embarassing mistakes will keep on happening.<br><br>A show insider told The Sun: &#x27;Susanna and Ben were stunned, especially after last week&#x27;s mishaps.<br><br>&#x27;To get the date of the show wrong is pretty poor by anybody&#x27;s standards — it was the worst possible start to the week. She&#x27;s let this one go, with a few eye rolls, but they keep happening.&#x27;<br><br>Another said: &#x27;It&#x27;s actually really sad — the production team seem totally incapable. They just seem overwhelmed.&#x27;<br><br>Last week, the broadcaster allegedly &#x27;made her feelings very clear&#x27; and confronted senior executives after a series of blunders made their way into the live broadcast.<br><br>Spelling mistakes, wrong dates and graphic mis-designs have all slipped through during live broadcasts of the show in recent weeks, leaving the host allegedly embarrassed.<br><br>Among the errors was one incident in which News Correspondent Ben Chapman&#x27;s name was spelt incorrectly during his live broadcast from Romania.<br><br>As Ranvir Singh presented the segment, she introduced Ben for his section - with his name appearing on the screen as &#x27;Ben Champan&#x27;.<br><br>Another incident saw GMB air a segment paying tribute to the death of Lisa Marie Presley, with the word &#x27;remembering&#x27; also spelt wrong on screen, as the graphic read: &#x27;Remebering&#x27;.<br><br>And that wasn&#x27;t all, as the wrong date was shown while Susanna was presenting the show one morning.<br><br>A source told The Sun: &#x27;She made her feelings very clear, and confronted the senior executives over it.<br><br>&#x27;Susanna is totally professional and just wants high standards — as Piers or any other presenter would have done.<br><br>&#x27;The last thing anyone wants is her walking away in anger.&#x27;<br><br>Susanna doesn&#x27;t appear to be the only one aggravated by the gaffes, as some viewers took to Twitter during the live morning shows to highlight GMB&#x27;s mistakes.<br><br>Calling out a poster it had made for rugby player Levi Simeon Davis, who went missing in October 2022, many noticed that the wrong year was printed on the graphic.</p>

    <p>&#x27;@gmb your poster for missing Levi has wrong date on it - says October 2023,&#x27; wrote on viewer.<br><br>While another advised: &#x27;Your poster shown on this morning&#x27;s news for the missing male is wrong check the date it&#x27;s showing October 2023 #GMB.&#x27;<br><br>Meanwhile, Susanna was in a better mood last Friday as she celebrated &#x27;terrific&#x27; viewing figures for Good Morning Britain.<br><br>She took to Twitter to share her delight that the breakfast news show had hit their highest figures since June 2021.<br><br>Sharing a grab of herself and co-host Ben Shephard on the show to Twitter this Friday, Susanna detailed her delight at fans tuning into the show.<br><br>She wrote: &#x27;RATINGS: terrific figures for yesterday’s @gmb (and a great week) highest Thursday numbers since June 2021, up 9% and +3.8 share points against the same day last year.<br><br>&#x27;We love that you are watching. Back on Monday with @benshephard&#x27;.<br><br>While Susanna is often praised for keeping her composure during live broadcasts, there have been incidents that she&#x27;s let her emotions slip in the past.<br><br>Earlier in the week, Susanna launched a blistering attack on former Health Secretary Matt Hancock.<br><br>The presenter asked him if his affair with aide Gina Coladangelo in fact broke the law and continued to quiz him on the lockdown laws at the time as he attempted to change the subject.<br><br>She was praised by viewers who took to Twitter to brand the interview a &#x27;masterclass&#x27; for any aspiring political journalists.<br><br>In November, Susanna launched a withering attack on a Just Stop Oil spokesperson this morning after the group halted traffic on the M25 again by climbing gantries on multiple junctions.<br><br>When the group&#x27;s spokesperson claimed the media weren&#x27;t reporting on events effectively, Susanna launched into an impassioned rant, telling him: &#x27;You don&#x27;t have any idea what this programme does... And you have the audacity to come on here and say we are completely distracted and we&#x27;re not talking about the issues?<br><br>&#x27;We&#x27;re talking about them every single morning, son.&#x27;<br><br>In 2021, Susanna was left unimpressed when her co-host at the time Alastair Campbell told her to ‘feel his wrinkly apples’ during an impassioned rant about a low-quality Ocado delivery.<br><br>Susanna looked unamused as the former Labour press strategist ranted about the condition of his fruit, which the grocery company attributed to a shortage of pickers, lorry drivers and CO2.<br><br>The presenter was also famed for her amusing clashes with former co-host Piers Morgan, with the pair famously not seeing eye to eye on numerous occasions.<br><br></p>
