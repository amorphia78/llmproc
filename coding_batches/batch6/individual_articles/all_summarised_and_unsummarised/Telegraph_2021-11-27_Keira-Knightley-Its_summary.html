    <p>The &#x27;pretty ingenue&#x27; from Love Actually discusses her approach to choosing contentious new films over blockbusters and her inability to please everyone.<br><br>Keira Knightley, 36, stars in a new film called Silent Night, a black comedy with uncanny parallels to the pandemic. The movie, written and directed by Camille Griffin, centers around a group of friends gathered for a Christmas dinner before taking suicide pills to avoid death by an incoming toxic gas cloud. While the threat in the film comes from climate change, the plot features food shortages, lockdowns, and final goodbyes made over Zoom calls.<br><br>Knightley finds the topic of climate change &quot;terrifying,&quot; having read extensively on the subject while pregnant with her second child. She even voiced a climate-crisis film for Extinction Rebellion.<br><br>The actress acknowledges that a comedy about such a subject may not be to everyone&#x27;s taste. &quot;I think it should come with a warning,&quot; she says, &quot;because now everybody is coming to the film with a lived experience, hopefully not as horrific as this one, but it has suddenly become a lot more raw.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Knightley&#x27;s approach to scripts these days favors contentious and thought-provoking material. &quot;I&#x27;m not frightened of contentious,&quot; she states. &quot;I love doing work that people will have a dialogue with, whether that&#x27;s positive or negative. I think that&#x27;s a very exciting place to be.&quot;<br><br>The film explores the maternal experience in a way Knightley hadn&#x27;t previously seen, which was another significant draw for her. She explains, &quot;There&#x27;s this breadth of emotion that comes with motherhood that just isn&#x27;t there in mass culture. You&#x27;re bringing life into the world, but you are also very aware of how fragile life is because of it.&quot;<br><br>Knightley&#x27;s career choices now prioritize family considerations and personal interest over crowd-pleasing blockbusters. She remains unafraid of small budgets and controversial topics, seeking roles that challenge her and provoke discussion.</p>
