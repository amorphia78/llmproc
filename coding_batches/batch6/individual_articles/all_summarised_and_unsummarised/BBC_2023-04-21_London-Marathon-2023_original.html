    <p>The endless miles, exhausted legs and copious amounts of carbohydrates have all led to this. The London Marathon is almost here.<br><br>More than 45,000 runners, each with their own reasons and motivations, are expected to tackle the 26.2 miles, raising millions of pounds for charity in the process.<br><br>Many will do so in fancy dress, others have world records in their sights; all will be cheered along the familiar crowd-lined streets.<br><br>Live coverage of this year&#x27;s race, which returns to its traditional spring date for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic, begins on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and online from 08:30 BST on Sunday.<br><br>Here&#x27;s everything you need to know about the 2023 London Marathon.<br><br>The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s elite races are bursting with quality, with many of the fastest runners in history set to take to London&#x27;s streets.<br><br>Great Britain&#x27;s Mo Farah is expecting an &quot;emotional&quot; day in London after announcing that this year&#x27;s race will be his last over the 26.2-mile distance as he begins to think about retirement.<br><br>The 10-time global track champion will be joined by four of the five fastest marathon runners in history - in addition to 2022 winner Amos Kipruto - with only world record holder Eliud Kipchoge, the official starter of the 2023 event, absent from the line-up.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s going to be my last-ever marathon, and the end of my career really,&quot; Farah told BBC Sport.<br><br>&quot;London is home for me. I love that I&#x27;m able to come back here and have my last race here,&quot; he added. &quot;Without the crowd and the support it wouldn&#x27;t be the same. London is special for how everybody comes together and supports you.&quot;<br><br>However, British women&#x27;s half marathon record holder Eilish McColgan - who like Farah was forced to pull out of last year&#x27;s race - has had to further postpone her full marathon debut because of a knee problem.<br><br>&quot;There have been a few factors - a bad storm - over the past few weeks and this knee thing is just the last crack in the armour,&quot; McColgan said. &quot;I have shed a lot of tears in recent days.&quot;<br><br>Reigning Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m champion Sifan Hassan, marathon record holder Brigid Kosgei, the unbeaten Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir and last year&#x27;s winner Yalemzerf Yehualaw are all present in another stacked elite field.<br><br>On the potential for a record-breaking race, Ethiopia&#x27;s Yehualaw said: &quot;I hope we will run a course record, a women&#x27;s only world record. I want to defend my title and I&#x27;m ready to do my best.&quot;<br><br>Mary Keitany&#x27;s 2017 London Marathon course record of two hours 17 minutes one second remains the quickest time in an all-women race - but Kosgei set the outright women&#x27;s record of 2:14:04 in 2019 in Chicago.<br><br>Among the other Britons, Emile Cairess makes his debut after matching Farah&#x27;s British 10km record last year, while compatriots Dewi Griffiths, Chris Thompson, Samantha Harrison and Alice Wright are also in action.<br><br>The world&#x27;s most lucrative wheelchair events see the return of course record holders and defending champions Marcel Hug and Catherine Debrunner.<br><br>Britain&#x27;s eight-time winner David Weir and Eden Rainbow-Cooper also start, with a record total prize pot of $253,500 (Â£204,138) on offer.<br><br>Those events will be started by Gordon Perry, the winner of the first wheelchair race held in London 40 years ago - while world 1500m champion Jake Wightman will officially start the biggest ever Mini London Marathon on Saturday.</p>
