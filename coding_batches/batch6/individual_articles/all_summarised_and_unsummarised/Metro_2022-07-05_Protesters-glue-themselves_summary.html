        <h1>Protesters glue themselves to The Last Supper painting at Royal Academy</h1><p>Just Stop Oil protesters have glued themselves to a sixteenth century painting at London&#x27;s Royal Academy in protest against climate inaction. Five campaigners glued their hands to the frame of a copy of Leonardo Da Vinci&#x27;s The Last Supper, attributed to one of the artist&#x27;s pupils, Giampietrino.<br><br>The group chose The Last Supper because people around the world are currently experiencing a food crisis caused in part by rising global temperatures. Jessica Agar, 21, an art student from Hereford, said: &quot;No sculpture can feed babies starving because extreme heat killed food crops. Nurses are lining up outside food banks, not galleries.&quot;<br><br>The activists also sprayed &#x27;no new oil&#x27; on the wall below the painting. They are calling for the government to commit to immediately halting new oil and gas licenses in the UK. Additionally, they demand that the directors of the gallery &quot;claim that power, close and refuse to open until the government commits to no new oil.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Just Stop Oil is urging the directors, employees, and members of art institutions to join their coalition in peaceful civil resistance. The group has been targeting the art world to pressure it into doing more to address the climate crisis and the continued production of fossil fuels.<br><br>Within minutes of the stunt, security guards ushered visitors and journalists out of the room and called the police. This protest is part of a series of similar actions taken by the group to draw attention to their cause and demand immediate action on climate change.</p></body></html>
