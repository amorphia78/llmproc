We can&#x27;t help you, go to Westminster.&quot;<br><br>Labour councillor Theresa Norton, 64, from Scarborough, attended to support the protest, saying: &quot;Half an hour&#x27;s disruption is not a massive sacrifice.</p>

    <p>&quot;It&#x27;s these people that are making the biggest sacrifice. They&#x27;ll be arrested, go to a police cell, go to court on Monday.&quot;<br><br>Just Stop Oil said the blockages follow four weeks of civil resistance, during which the police have made 626 arrests.<br><br>Speaking after the protest, Met Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said Just Stop Oil protests had &quot;caused a significant amount of disruption and frustration among the public in London&quot;.<br><br>He added: &quot;We will always provide a proportionate policing response to protest and try to work with organisers so that protests can go ahead safely.<br><br>&quot;However, the public rightly expects us to respond quickly and effectively where protest crosses the line into criminality.&quot;<br><br>Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
