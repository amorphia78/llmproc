    <p>Activists and politicians have cautiously welcomed an unexpected US-China declaration that vowed to boost climate co-operation.<br><br>The EU and UN described the move as encouraging and an important step, but Greenpeace said both countries needed to take concrete action.<br><br>The US and China are the world&#x27;s two biggest CO2 emitters.<br><br>They said they would work together to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.<br><br>Scientists say that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C will help humanity avoid the worst climate impacts. This is compared with pre-industrial temperatures.<br><br>While the latest pledge is short on detail, analysts say it is a tacit acknowledgement by China that the crisis warrants urgent attention and that it will play a bigger role in confronting the global challenge.<br><br>The announcement by the two global rivals was made on Wednesday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, which officially ends on Friday.<br><br>US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are now expected to hold a virtual meeting as early as next week.<br><br>According to China&#x27;s climate envoy, the declaration was agreed following some 30 meetings with the US over the past 10 months.<br><br>It pledges close co-operation on cutting emissions, while a joint working group will also &quot;meet regularly to address the climate crisis&quot; over the next decade.<br><br>The reaction to the surprise agreement has been largely positive, but experts and activists have warned that policies must now be enacted to support the promises.<br><br>Genevieve Maricle, director of US climate policy action at pressure group WWF, said the announcement offered &quot;new hope&quot; that the 1.5C limit might be achieved.<br><br>But she added that &quot;we must also be clear eyed about what is still required if the two countries are to deliver the emission reductions necessary in the next nine years&quot;.</p>

    <p>Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan warned that China and the US needed to show greater commitment to reaching climate goals.<br><br>Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who is president of the Asia Society which works on global climate change agreements, told the BBC that the agreement was &quot;not a gamechanger&quot; but was a big step forward.<br><br>&quot;The current state of geopolitics between China and the United States is awful, so the fact that you can extract this... agreement between Washington and Beijing right now is [important],&quot; he said.<br><br>The US-China declaration calls for increased efforts to close the &quot;significant gap&quot; that remains to achieve that 1.5C target.<br><br>There were steps agreed on a range of issues including methane emissions, the transition to clean energy and de-carbonisation.<br><br>China&#x27;s top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua told reporters that on climate change &quot;there is more agreement between China and US than divergence&quot;.<br><br>China refused to join an agreement earlier this week to limit methane - a harmful greenhouse gas, but has instead pledged to develop a &quot;national plan&quot; to address the issue.<br><br>Mr Xie was followed by John Kerry, the US climate envoy, who said that while US and China had many differences, co-operation on climate was vital.<br><br>&quot;Every step matters right now and we have a long journey ahead of us,&quot; he said.<br><br>China is the world&#x27;s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, followed by the US. In September Mr Xi announced that China would aim for carbon neutrality by 2060, with a plan to hit peak emissions before 2030.<br><br>The US is aiming for net-zero by 2050.<br><br>In other developments at the COP26 climate summit on Wednesday:<br><br>What will climate change look like for you?<br><br>Will the UK meet its climate targets?<br><br>How extreme weather is linked to climate change</p>
