        <h1>Laurence Fox on his anti-woke party, racism rows and why he needs a bodyguard</h1><p>Across Laurence Fox’s open-plan sitting room, I glimpse the future. It’s possibly, although one hopes not, the future of British politics. Almost unavoidably, it is the future of Laurence, the well-loved scion of the Fox acting dynasty who has recast himself as the leader of the anti-woke brigade’s brand new party.<br><br>At first I think the huge bloke I spot in his kitchen must be our photographer, so I call out that I am wrapping up the interview. He looks puzzled. That’s no snapper. That’s Fox’s bodyguard.<br><br>“Paul keeps an eye on me,” Fox explains. “He makes sure no one throws a punch.”<br><br>Is he is joking?<br><br>“No, there are some nasty people out there.”<br><br>And the party pays for Paul?<br><br>“The party has a budget and within that budget is a budget for security. Of course there is. Do you want a milkshake in your face? I don’t particularly. I certainly don’t want any violence anywhere near my children [he has two sons from his marriage to Billie Piper]. Their wellbeing is absolutely 100 per cent my thing.”<br><br>It has been a year of two halves for Laurence Fox. At its beginning, the 42-year-old, who for a decade was the temperate James Hathaway in ITV’s Lewis, managed to accuse a black woman of racism on television, a bon mot that sank his acting career in spectacularly speedy fashion. In April his mother died. Then in September came what he must regard as, and I rather doubt can be, the good news. Just as his fans had got used to him playing Lord Palmerston in Victoria, he became a politician for real and leader of the Reclaim Party. Although still awaiting the Electoral Commission’s approval for its name, Reclaim has registered “interest” from 30,000 visitors to its rudimentary website and has lined its pockets with a £5 million donation from Jeremy Hosking, a right-wing businessman who approached Fox with this new wheeze in the summer.<br><br>Our conversation starts in the kitchen of his recently bought terraced house in Stockwell, south London. Its very atmosphere is politically incorrect, filled with tobacco smoke generated by Fox and two Reclaim PRs. He wants me to view on his phone a clip from Channel 5’s Jeremy Vine show in which the journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown calls him “a racist bully”. He is trying to work out whether her immediate retraction, unaccompanied by the “formal apology” he asked for, precludes him from suing. For someone who has been through a messy divorce, he seems curiously keen for some more learned friends to re-enter his already complicated life.<br><br>For our discussion, we sit in his front room drinking coffee, in my case from a mug marked LIBERAL TEARS: STILL WARM. He takes his coffee with more roll-ups, of which he reckons he gets through 30 a day, resulting in a voice that sounds as if it has trundled up a mineshaft. At one point his dogs, Blaze the labrador and Sparky the Jack Russell, get excited and he commands them to leave. I praise their obedience.<br><br>“Well, you know, you’ve got to have a pack leader with dogs. Otherwise dogs bark and they’re noisy and they’re not polite to guests. Dogs are like anyone. They need to understand good manners, don’t they?”<br><br>Does Britain need a strong leader then, I ask, my mind flashing up an image of Oswald Mosley in his Seventies fantasy comeback phase.<br><br>“Britain needs a leader, yes, someone who doesn’t flip-flop between one thing or the other, and someone with deep conviction and a patriotic love for this land of ours. Absolutely it does. Look at the mess we’re in at the moment.”<br><br>Does modesty forbid him from naming that man?<br><br>“I don’t know who that man is.”<br><br>Is it him?<br><br>“No. At the moment, no,” he says, ominously.<br><br>We go back a dozen years, Laurence and I, and given how much else has changed for him, I am surprised how little he has physically altered: his hair still, perhaps suspiciously, blond, his face still fresh and smooth. The first time I interviewed him, in 2008, was soon after his marriage to Piper, the former pop singer turned actress, at their Withnail-like cottage in Sussex. With typical acuity I judged the girl from the Swindon state school and the Old Harrovian well suited, “funny, clever, their work ethic checked by a slacker tendency”. Three years later, I met him for Lewis in Oxford, where Fox was fishing for pike in the Isis. He remembers telling me he was bored. Four years after that, we were in a pub in London discussing his new album — he is a part-time singer-songwriter — which seemed largely to be about his rows with Piper. “Yeah,” he says now, “it was really going tits-up then when we spoke.” The following year, 2016, they divorced.<br><br>In all these encounters I would never have thought him a reactionary. He was anti private schools, not wishing his boys to turn out “posh” — a “leftie” position he retains, although he lost the argument with Piper. Winston, 12, and Eugene, 8, go to “expensive, progressive private” schools. Playing De Gaulle in a play four years ago, he refused to say the word “mongol” in relation to the French president’s daughter with Down’s syndrome. He weirdly voted for Jeremy Corbyn in 2017.<br><br>So has he changed or has the world?<br><br>“No, I’ve stayed the same.” It is the moral superiority of the left that has altered, he explains. “You are cancelled and removed from this society and this culture unless you hold a certain set of views,” he says, although his views, not dissimilar to those readily available in the papers and online in any case, have been everywhere in the past nine months.<br><br>I agree that virtue signalling is irritating. Motives are hard to prove, and people do things to look good or because they feel guilty, but the result of it just may be a more egalitarian, fairer society.<br><br>“I couldn’t disagree with you more. I think we are the most divided we’ve ever been as a society. In my lifetime, it’s the most divided. I think identitarianism is poison, absolute utter poison.”<br><br>In the checklist of views that these days tells you on which side of cultural wars you lie, Fox’s opinions occupy almost exclusively the column on the right, the single exception being Brexit, where he stood, as he says, on the “virtuous” — that is the Remainer — side.<br><br>Race is his starter for ten. On BBC Question Time in January they were discussing the Duchess of Sussex’s drubbing in the press. From the audience, Rachel Boyle, an academic specialising in race, racism and ethnicity, said the abuse Meghan was attracting was racism. His head shaking wearily, Fox disagreed (“We are the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe”) and said her argument was getting “boring”. Boyle, who anyone could see is black, called him a “white privileged male”. He told her she was being racist towards him.<br><br>Was it sensible to call a black woman a racist?<br><br>“She was being racist. Yeah, I think we should call out individual examples of racism.”<br><br>But we know racism against white people doesn’t matter half as much as racism against black people.<br><br>“Why is that?”<br><br>Because we (I also opine as a white privileged male) have held the upper hand for centuries. Our feelings are pretty impregnable.<br><br>“Who ended slavery?” he asks.<br><br>We did, having promulgated it for centuries.<br><br>“Yes, but who ended it? All I’m asking for is, instead of going, ‘You’re all evil white people,’ to remember 1,500 British Royal Navy people died stopping slavery by the Barbary pirates.”<br><br>On the night, the QT chairwoman, Fiona Bruce, felt things were becoming unseemly and moved on. The row stayed put and got stuck in. Soon a committee of the actors’ union, Equity, had tweeted that Fox was a disgrace to his industry. Not long afterwards his agent, Sue Latimer, took him off her books.<br><br>There were other consequences. His girlfriend, the fashion designer and photographer, Sara McKinnon, who is half-Kuwaiti, dumped him (he denies reports they are back together). Relations with his sister, Lydia, and her husband, the comedian Richard Ayoade, who is half-Nigerian, became strained, although he now says he sees them all the time.<br><br>Initially, Fox appeared to stop digging the hole he was in. He met the academic Bonnie Greer and over coffee at the British Museum she explained how he had offended. On Twitter they posed in an embrace, although she has since, he says, failed to respond to his offers of more coffee. Today I discover his views on race have calcified into a political position. Yes, black people have had “historically a more difficult time”, he will say, but then triumphantly add that the pay gap between black and white people between 16 and 30 is now “non-existent”.<br><br>I point out that it will be non-existent in the lower-paid, less senior jobs. Higher up, including in my newsroom, black people are under-represented. He agrees there is more we can do, but says unless we point out the positive steps we have taken, our children will leave school thinking “we need to de-colonise the curriculum, we need to remove statues”.<br><br>But sinking Edward Colston’s statue in Bristol harbour was by popular demand and a good thing, I say.<br><br>“No, it’s appalling. It was absolutely wrong,” he says. “It’s not up to mobs to turn up and tear down statues.”<br><br>And on to Black Lives Matter. I admit the reaction to George Floyd’s killing was a wake-up call for me. The feelings of black people are now higher up my personal agenda. Whatever the additional political objectives of it, BLM has done the world a great deal of good. Does he agree?<br><br>“Of course black lives matter,” he says.<br><br>But the slogan exists because black people feel theirs don’t?<br><br>“We are addressing it. Are we not? But then, help us out here. Let’s also have a broad discussion about it. You notice how George Floyd has disappeared slightly into the background in terms of what’s happening in his legal case and the consequences surrounding his death.”<br><br>What does he mean by that?<br><br>“Well just, you know, the autopsy findings in regards to him and all of this stuff.”<br><br>Hang on. This sounds a bit conspiracy theorist. “No. Look it up and then we can discuss it,” he suggests.<br><br>“Black Lives Matter as a movement is there to topple western democracy and defund the family and defund law enforcement. And I’m sorry, I’m not happy about that. It’s like, sorry, no, I don’t agree with you as a movement. I stand in direct opposition to you as a movement because I take a more balanced view.”</p>

    <p>And here come more of Fox’s more balanced views.<br><br>MeToo: “MeToo started in the black community in America. It didn’t start in the white showbiz community. It was interesting actually that showbusiness, the most hypocritical, casting couch-based system of female oppression — if there is such a thing, which is another conversation — decided to take it on. It gave it another layer of moral superiority and hypocrisy.”<br><br>The trans debate: “There are now 136 or something recognised genders. This isn’t science.”<br><br>The BBC: “Utterly defund the BBC, decriminalise the licence fee and get rid of it, throw it out to the free market.”<br><br>Extinction Rebellion: “Doomsday cultists have existed all over the world, haven’t they, for many, many years. And that’s fine. Is there man-made climate change? Of course there is. Is it the end of the world? No.”<br><br>The Covid-19 restrictions, which he cheerfully tweeted on November 29 he had ignored by holding a large lunch party: “I suppose we gave up our freedom so quickly because we were all so terrified, and that’s totally understandable. But how do you get that liberty back?”<br><br>The NHS — actually, there is a balance here. Its emergency care is “astonishingly good” as he discovered when his mother fell down some stairs. Covid, however, has proved it “unfit for purpose” and there was no clapping from him on Thursday nights.<br><br>“I just happen to wonder that if a virus of this level of survivability is going to overwhelm a hugely well-funded organisation then whether there is a problem with the management of that organisation.<br><br>“It’s the new God, you know,” says Fox, the son of evangelical Christians, who “most certainly” believes in God and prays with his children.<br><br>I tell him what it all sounds like to many people: were Laurence a child we would say he has got very angry and is now acting out and causing fights.<br><br>He takes this with equanimity and refers me to the theory of the Overton window of political acceptability. “If your Overton window is that far over there [his palms measure out a space to the left], there are many ways to bring it back to the centre and one of them is for you to give it a good shove, because it starts making conversation. I’m only really interested in generating conversations.”<br><br>But look at the conversations he is generating! He has got a respected Asian journalist calling him a racist.<br><br>“That probably says more about her than it does about me, I would say, seeing as I dealt with her [on Channel 5] in a very calm and generous and reasoned manner.”<br><br>He did, but he is also saying things, albeit in his calm, educated voice, so inflammatory that there’s a bodyguard in his kitchen. Fox throws the names of academics into our conversation, talks of “cognitive dissonance” and “critical race theory”, but much as he would like us to think he has locked himself in his study and read each side of every argument, his arguments sound as if they come from a position of aggrieved pain.<br><br>His hostility to the NHS sounds almost personal. Perhaps it is. He tells me graphically of a 55-year-old friend who “choked on their own vomit after not being put on a heart rate monitor in the NHS two weeks ago”. No, he is not suggesting NHS negligence. His mother, Mary, died at home in April because having worked in the NHS in her youth and being “a smart cookie”, she did not want to die in hospital. “Breaking the rules again,” her family were at her bedside. “She had multiple medical issues and she passed away but they were mad keen to put it down to a Covid death.” These stories sound angry, politicised.<br><br>Where he has a justifiable grievance is that his career has been killed because he spoke his mind in a free society. He is deeply hurt, as well he might be — his father is James Fox (star of that classic Sixties movie Performance, a poster of which is framed above his sofa); half of his family is in showbusiness. As he sees it, an agent who knows he is not racist dropped him because others said he was, and now he has no access to work.<br><br>“When something like that happens to you, emotionally it’s very profound – to have your career, 22 years of a career, just gone. Bye! So you have a visceral, emotional reaction to it, which makes you feel hopeless and broken, and then you start going, ‘God, there’s something really badly wrong here.’ And then you go, ‘I need to do something about it.’ That’s the process.”<br><br>Yet to believe 2020 remade Fox is to deny the continuity in the life of an extrovert from a noisy theatrical family that, despite its descent into religiosity, was bohemian, dissident and suspicious of institutions.<br><br>“We sat round dinner tables and we were encouraged to explore all our views and to speak freely, and, as you know, that got me into trouble at Harrow because I used to say what I thought.”<br><br>Yes, that and having sex with two girls at a school ball, I say.<br><br>Let’s pick up his life again at Billie Piper’s arrival into it. In their divorce, she accused him of unreasonable behaviour in their marriage, a concept he says is “a bit backward” while refusing to say whether, in his case, the allegation was true. His mother, he says, always said it took “two to tango”, but he does not want to talk about Piper or their custody fight (their sons’ custody is now shared). “I don’t have a bad word to say. She’s their mother.”<br><br>During this dark period he was prescribed sleeping pills, which did little good. He talked in one interview of having become suicidal. He says to me that in the old days people talked of mental breakdowns. Is that what he had?<br><br>“No. I’m too tough for that sort of thing. I’m sensitive though. So it’s an interesting combination. I’m profoundly sensitive but I’m also someone who won’t be bullied into submission.”<br><br>He won’t tell me if he has a girlfriend, but insists he is happy, confusingly adding that he has never not been. I explain why I am asking: people are looking at what is going on with this Reclaim thing and wondering if his life has got so screwed up that he has gone slightly mad.<br><br>“And they have the absolute right to say it. I think you can say whatever you want.”<br><br>He knows what I’m asking: I’m asking what kind of place he is in right now, whether he’s fit to lead a national party, whether it is a good idea for him, never mind the country, to do so.<br><br>“I think for me it’s an important thing. I feel that life is a journey and, as I alluded earlier, I have faith. So I have faith that you end up in a position and that position is important and my job and my duty are to try to create more equality for people.”<br><br>There is a massive problem with Reclaim, of course. Well, many, but here’s the fundamental one: it is fighting the way people with power and influence think, but you cannot pass a law to make Britain less woke.<br><br>“I mean, deep down I would like to get rid of the [2010] Equality Act, because that’s where a lot of the protected characteristics come in,” he says. “I’m no great brains on legislation but I look into it and I hire and I consult with people as part of the growing of the party and the growing of what is essentially a movement at the moment rather than a party, but will eventually have the fangs to be a party should needs be.”<br><br>The thought of Reclaim getting its fangs into an election or by-election is pretty terrifying. He mentions Rotherham and, in his words, “the mass raping of white women by Muslim men” and “the total silencing of it”. It could, he thinks, be an example of Reclaim achieving something “in microcosm”.<br><br>I’m sorry, Laurence, I say. I can’t imagine anything worse than having a candidate from Reclaim standing in Rotherham.<br><br>“I didn’t say that’s what we’re going to do, did I though?”<br><br>He did not. I am not sure if there is a plan. It is next to certain, however, that this project will fail, just as most new parties fail in the end in this country, usually quickly.<br><br>“All political careers end in doom. Yeah. My job is very simple. It’s a very simple job. My job is to go, ‘The Overton window is over here. We need to shove it back in the middle.’ ”<br><br>Where Fox may be right is that some of our national institutions have presumed a cultural consensus, including on free speech itself, without having created that consensus. He rightly challenges me when I patronisingly say that I would not like to meet his followers. He reads me a touching letter from an experienced nurse, once married to a Ugandan, who says Fox is right both about the NHS and race relations. “These are the people that aren’t flag-shaggers,” he says. “These are the people that care deeply about our country.”<br><br>Yet towards the end of our conversation he starts repeating a Trumpian conspiracy theorist about the Antifa movement and calls the outgoing resident of the White House “the last bastion of stopping America becoming socialist”. I turn off my recorder. I say I don’t want to hear any more.<br><br>When he is not detonating thought-bombs that mainly go off in his own face, he remains rather charming. His candour is warming. He listens. He is generous. The first time we met he insisted on giving me a bottle of his wedding champagne. This time I leave with a very good bottle of red. I don’t think he thinks he is bribing me and indeed, when he rings me the next day asking me to keep something out of the piece and I refuse, he peaceably accepts the fact.<br><br>He looks exhilarated but I’d say his is the exhilaration of someone who has thrown himself naked into the ocean in December.<br><br>He will soon realise it is bloody cold and there are sharks about. He texts me to say he hopes he expressed the importance of his desire to bring people together: “There is room for a positive message, even when we don’t agree.” Sure there is, but that is not why Paul the bodyguard is now in his life. Fox wants to shake things up. Let’s hope nothing worse than a milkshake gets spilt.</p></body></html>
