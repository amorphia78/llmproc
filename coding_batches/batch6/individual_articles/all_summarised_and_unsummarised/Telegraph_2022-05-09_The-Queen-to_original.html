    <p>The Queen will miss the State Opening of Parliament on Tuesday for the first time in nearly 60 years, as she continues to suffer with &quot;episodic mobility problems&quot;.<br><br>The Prince of Wales will read the Queen’s Speech on her behalf and at her request - the first time he has taken on such a major constitutional duty, Buckingham Palace announced.<br><br>It is only the third time the Queen, 96, has not attended the ceremonial occasion during her reign. In 1959 and in 1963, when she was pregnant with the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex respectively, the Lord Chancellor delivered the speech.<br><br>However, it is the first time Letters Patent have been used to hand the responsibility to another member of the Royal family. It was authorised by Her Majesty to specifically cover the State Opening, delegating the royal function of opening a new session of Parliament to Counsellors of State.<br><br>The move will be interpreted as a significant shift in the Prince of Wales&#x27;s responsibilities as heir to the throne. The Duke of Cambridge will accompany him, in his capacity as Counsellor of State.<br><br>No other functions have been delegated by the Queen. The Duchess of Cornwall will also attend but is not a Counsellor of State.<br><br>Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Monday: &quot;The Queen continues to experience episodic mobility problems, and in consultation with her doctors has reluctantly decided that she will not attend the State Opening of Parliament tomorrow.<br><br>&quot;At Her Majesty&#x27;s request, and with the agreement of the relevant authorities, the Prince of Wales will read the Queen&#x27;s Speech on Her Majesty&#x27;s behalf, with the Duke of Cambridge also in attendance.&quot;<br><br>A palace source said the decision was taken on Monday, noting that the monarch had continued to suffer with mobility problems since last autumn.<br><br>It is not yet known whether the wording of the speech will be tweaked to reflect that the Prince is reading it on behalf of his mother, who traditionally refers to &quot;my government&quot;. On the previous two occasions, it was not changed but delivered in Her Majesty’s own words.<br><br>The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will sit in their usual seats, while the Duke will sit on the opposite side to his stepmother. The main throne will not be occupied.<br><br>The Prince will wear his Admiral of the Fleet uniform, while the Duke is expected to wear a morning coat.<br><br>The Imperial State Crown and regalia, which is traditionally transported to the Houses of Parliament in a carriage ahead of the Queen, will still be taken on the journey, it is understood.<br><br>Some 38 pieces of proposed legislation will be announced in the Queen’s Speech - more than the preceding year - as Boris Johnson looks to move on from heavy local election losses.<br><br>In a statement on Monday, the Prime Minister said: “This Queen’s Speech will get our country back on track, and I will strive – and this government will strive – night and day to deliver it.<br><br>“Because in spite of everything we have been through, we are going to ensure that over the two years we have left in this parliament, we spend every second uniting and levelling up this country, exactly as we said we would.”<br><br>Mr Johnson will recommit to hard-hitting protest reforms, despite sizable opposition from the House of Lords, announcing a new Bill to drive through the changes.<br><br>If enacted, protesters who lock themselves to buildings face up to six months in jail, while those who disrupt key national infrastructure - such as railways and airports - could be jailed for a year. Both could face unlimited fines.<br><br>It is an attempt by ministers to curb the impact of so-called “guerrilla protests” seen by environmental groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil.</p>

    <p>Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, championing the overhaul, said: “The law-abiding, responsible majority have had enough of anti-social, disruptive protests carried out by a self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery for the rest of us.<br><br>“The Public Order Bill will give the police the powers they need to clamp down on this outrageous behaviour and ensure the British public can go about their lives without disruption.”<br><br>The Telegraph can also reveal that new measures will be announced to force P&amp;O and other ferry companies to pay staff on board ships the UK minimum wage.<br><br>The proposal would create a legal obligation on ports to make sure vessels that arrive - which could also include cruise ships and tankers - pay minimum wage, with sanctions for ports and UK shipping operators who disobey the rules.<br><br>Other expected announcements will be dropped as part of a new Downing Street push to focus on Tory policies, meaning the foie gras and fur imports bans will be ditched.<br><br>The speech is not expected to include new measures to tackle the cost of living, despite Tory strategists warning it will be the dominant issue at the next general election.<br><br>Any changes to taxation levels and spending will have to wait until the autumn Budget, according to Treasury sources - although Mr Johnson hopes other non-fiscal moves can be announced sooner.<br><br>But the Prime Minister will talk about the scale of the cost of living challenge and the need to help those affected in his speech.<br><br>Mr Johnson is expected to say: “We will get the country through the aftershocks of Covid, just as we got through Covid, with every ounce of ingenuity and compassion and hard work.<br><br>“By urgently pressing on with our mission to create the high wage, high skilled jobs that will drive economic growth across our whole United Kingdom.<br><br>“That is the long-term, sustainable solution to ease the burden on families and businesses.”<br><br>The palace had previously stated that the Queen hoped to read her customary speech to open Parliament on Tuesday, but said final confirmation would only be given on the day.<br><br>Measures had been put in place to ensure privacy on her entrance and exit, with part of the walk shielded from cameras and the event pared back as much as possible.<br><br>She had been expected to travel by car to the Houses of Parliament wearing day dress without a heavy crown, and walk as short a route as possible through the Palace of Westminster.<br><br>Palace aides pointed out that the Queen has a busy diary this week, including a call with Australia on Monday, a planned Privy Council and a virtual audience with the Prime Minister on Wednesday. She is also expected to undertake some private engagements later in the week.<br><br>The Queen&#x27;s diary has been significantly scaled back in recent months, following a series of health scares.<br><br>In recognition of her increasing frailty, Buckingham Palace has indicated that the public can no longer assume they will see her at public engagements, with her attendance only confirmed on the day in question.<br><br>She recently spent more than three months resting on doctors&#x27; orders.<br><br>In October, a trip to Northern Ireland was cancelled and she spent a night in hospital for what a spokesman described at the time as &quot;preliminary investigations&quot;.<br><br>The Queen also pulled out of attending the Cop26 climate change summit, the Festival of Remembrance and then the Remembrance Sunday Cenotaph service due to a sprained back, and missed the Church of England&#x27;s General Synod.<br><br>Last month, she missed the traditional Maundy Thursday and Easter Mattins church services at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.</p>
