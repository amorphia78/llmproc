    <p>Police have arrested a further 11 Insulate Britain protesters after they defied a government injunction by blocking the M25 for the seventh time.<br><br>The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, glued their hands to the road surface at Junction 3 in Swanley, Kent at 7.30am on Wednesday, Kent Police said.<br><br>Just before 9am, the force said they had arrested all 11 activists involved, bringing the number of Insulate Britain arrests to 438.<br><br>&quot;The Swanley Interchange roundabout at J3 of the M25 has now reopened following an earlier protest, which has resulted in us arresting 11 people,&quot; police wrote on Twitter.<br><br>&quot;Delays remain in the area whilst the backlog of traffic clears. Thank you for your patience.&quot;<br><br>The government was granted an injunction by the High Court last week banning anyone from blocking the M25 following the group&#x27;s initial protests.<br><br>Anyone who breaks an injunction can be found in contempt of court and could face two years in prison and an unlimited fine.<br><br>Kent Police Superintendent Andy Gadd said the force is working with prosecutors to seek &quot;the most appropriate outcome&quot; following Insulate Britain protests in the county.</p>

    <p>&quot;As part of those enquiries, we are liaising closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure that the most appropriate outcome is sought, including if any charges can be made,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;Kent Police will continue to monitor the situation, working with neighbouring police forces and partner agencies to ensure disruption to traffic and local communities is kept to a minimum.&quot;<br><br>But the group, which wants the government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to reduce carbon emissions, appeared defiant on Wednesday.<br><br>&quot;We are going nowhere. You can raid our savings. You can confiscate our property. You can deny us our liberty and put us behind bars,&quot; they tweeted.<br><br>&quot;But shooting the messenger can never destroy the message: that this country is going to hell unless you take emergency action to stop putting carbon into the air.<br><br>&quot;Boris get on with the job.&quot;<br><br>As well as targeting the London ring road, so far protesters have blocked other important routes, including the A1(M) and A20 near the port of Dover.</p>
