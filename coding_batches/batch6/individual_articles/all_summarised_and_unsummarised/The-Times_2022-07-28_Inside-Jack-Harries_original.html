        <h1>Inside Jack Harries and Alice Aedy’s pad in Hackney, east London</h1><p>Sweden has Greta Thunberg, Britain has Jack Harries. The documentary film-maker and climate activist, 29, is the Harry Styles of the environmental movement: he has interviewed Barack Obama and Sir David Attenborough, and amassed 1.3 million followers on Instagram and 3.7 million subscribers on YouTube, with beautifully shot films of Earth in peril. Yet some of the user comments are less about carbon footprints and more about his looks: “Whaddababe”; “Sexy eco-warrior” etc.<br><br>“The internet rewards a certain type of thing. And so I think we play that game in order to further the message we’re passionate about,” says Harries, on a Zoom chat from his newly renovated loft-style flat in a 1920s former shoe factory flat in Hackney, east London, where he lives with his girlfriend, Alice Aedy, 27, also a photographer and film-maker.<br><br>That message is to raise awareness of climate change through storytelling. In 2020 Aedy, Harries and his twin brother, Finn, established a production company, Earthrise Studio, that produces films and photojournalism about communities on the front lines of global warming — in Kiribati, Somaliland, Greenland, Bhutan, Borneo. “We spent a few years going on Extinction Rebellion protests but our friends and families didn’t want to go on the marches; it all felt a bit extreme,” he says. “We wanted to find a way to bridge the gap . . . and try to change the perception of what it is to be an environmentalist. [When I was] growing up, it was a hippy with long hair and candles and no one wants to sort of join that movement. We’re trying to frame it to be a little bit more aspirational.”<br><br>Their home and activist HQ certainly fits that dream — there are no tie-dye prints, wind chimes and hair shirts here. The couple, who met five and a half years ago when they were working in the Jungle refugee camp in Calais, dreamt of creating a live/work space with good light where they could shoot stills and video, and record podcasts. It’s a far cry from making YouTube videos in his bedroom. Harries rose to fame when he was 18, when he and Finn made fun, wacky videos in their gap year (making his bedroom into a ball pit; blowing up pumpkins). They became so successful that in 2011, when Google emailed him to say that he could monetise his content, Harries quit university after only one term at Bristol. “My parents were horrified.” (He has since gained a master’s degree from University College London in documentary film-making.)<br><br>The 1,000 sq ft space was renovated by the architect Studio McW. Aedy’s brief was “a multipurpose live/work space. We wanted to celebrate the materiality of the space: the concrete and brick, lots of joinery, and add clay to the walls for a textural, earthy feel.” The flat is two storeys, with an upside-down layout: the living space upstairs and the bedroom downstairs. The original layout was odd: the front door opened right into the bedroom (they have since built a little corridor). Upstairs they knocked down walls to create a vast open-plan space. The result is London’s coolest WFH pad, with high ceilings, roof lights, exposed beams, handcrafted joinery, a long table, Sage coffee maker and a chillout zone — Earthrise Studio’s team of seven congregates here for brainstorming sessions. Open plan is noisy, however. Aedy says: “In hindsight, maybe we would have done things differently.”</p>

    <p>Aedy’s original vision was a “hyper-minimalist” space, but it quickly turned into a jungle thanks to their lockdown love affair with the houseplant delivery website Patch Plants. “We don’t really see a plant out of our window so we’ve had to bring nature in,” Aedy says.<br><br>The new staircase is made from reclaimed timber; the clay walls are by a Cornish company called Clayworks and apparently absorb toxins. The couple have an almost vegan diet (they eat eggs) and are upgrading their Crittall-style windows to double-glazing, but admit they are not saints. They had concrete worktops made during the renovation. “It is sturdy but I don’t know if we would do it again; we don’t love the environmental impact of concrete and it does stain,” Aedy says.<br><br>“We’re aware of that conversation around hypocrisy and we try to be really honest and say, we are far from perfect,” she adds. Aedy says that they do carbon offsets when they fly, donate to the communities where they film and try to use remote film crews on projects rather than flying there. “This is about creating systems and structures that allow us all to do better rather than pointing a finger at the individual.”<br><br>When they’re not on assignment they’re living the young east London dream. They run around Victoria Park, swim at London Fields Lido and buy their coffee beans from Broadway Market. “It took me a while to convince Jack to move to east London,” Aedy says. “But within about 24 hours he was going to the E5 Bakehouse, getting the loaf of bread in the morning on his very east London bike. And I just thought, ‘This guy’s happy.’ ”<br><br>When they go out for coffee it’s to La Bouche on Broadway Market. “We always wanted a regular coffee place, where they know your order, just like in Friends,” Aedy says.<br><br>With millions of followers on social media, Harries does get recognised. “There were a couple of years where it was quite mental. Interactions on the street were quite overwhelming — screaming and that sort of thing,” he says, although he is trying to shift the focus away from his image to the issues. “But as we’ve grown our audience have grown up as well. So people might now come up and say they’ve been studying environmental science and that’s really lovely because you can have much more nourishing conversations.”<br><br>Harries has spoken extensively about mental health, particularly the issue of climate anxiety. Can he offer any hope? “I’ve lost a lot of hope in top-down change,” he says. “I’ve found my hope is in people who take action in their own communities. I met a young woman called Poppy Okotcha in Totnes [in Devon] who turned her normal garden into an abundant rewilded vegetable garden, and a guy called Ryan in the Orkneys who works on a tidal turbine that creates energy. He said to me, ‘Instead of people getting arrested on the streets, why don’t they just get on with it and do things?’ That’s an example of a community that became self-reliant in terms of energy. I think that’s where the hope lies.”earthrise.studio; studiomcw.co.uk</p></body></html>
