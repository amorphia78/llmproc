    <p>Quan Nguyen, Scotland coordinator of the COP26 Coalition, which is organising protests in Glasgow on 6 November and elsewhere, said: &quot;Protest and dissent are vital to a healthy democracy, and are how human rights and justice have always been won the world over.<br><br>&quot;Without protest, the political will to act is just not there. The rights to protest, freedom of assembly and freedom of expression are protected rights which the police have a legal duty to defend.&quot;<br><br>One activist yet to decide if they&#x27;ll be heading to Glasgow is Greta Thunberg. She has said she&#x27;ll only travel if it&#x27;s &quot;considered safe and democratic&quot; - including ensuring participants from poorer countries are fully vaccinated.<br><br>And asked if she believed Scotland was a world leader on climate change, as its government claims, Thunberg told the BBC: &quot;No... I mean, there are some countries that do a bit more than certain others, but then if we look at it from a broader perspective then I think we can safely say there are no countries - at least in the global north - that are even doing close to what would be needed.&quot;<br><br>Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player<br><br>The announcement comes as Extinction Rebellion protests in London enter their second week.<br><br>The demonstrators are targeting the City of London, where they say &quot;the financial industry is bleeding the Earth dry&quot; through fossil fuel finance.<br><br>The Metropolitan Police confirmed it spent more than Â£50m policing Extinction Rebellion protests in 2019 and 2020.</p></body></html>
