        <h1>Increase in burning of plastic 'driving up emissions from waste disposal'</h1><p>Carbon emissions from waste disposal are rising due to the expansion of energy-from-waste incineration plants, according to a coalition of campaigners. By 2030, the government&#x27;s push to increase waste incineration will boost CO2 emissions by 10m tonnes annually, primarily from burning plastics. This growth in energy-from-waste incineration may prevent the UK from meeting its commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.<br><br>A group including Extinction Rebellion&#x27;s zero waste group, Friends of the Earth, the UK Without Incineration Network (UKWIN), Greenpeace, and MP John Cruddas has written an open letter to the prime minister. They are calling for legislation requiring the waste sector to decarbonise by 2035, similar to laws passed in Scandinavian countries and Finland.<br><br>Rembrandt Koppelaar, an environmental economist and co-author of the letter, stated, &quot;The UK will not be able to deliver on its net zero commitments unless the government intervenes in the waste sector.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The amount of waste incinerated in the UK has more than doubled from 4.9m tonnes in 2014 to 10.8m tonnes in 2017-18 and is set to continue rising. Meanwhile, recycling rates have plateaued, and the UK is expected to miss its 50% recycling target by the end of this year.<br><br>Government figures show that in 2018-19, nearly half (43.8%) of waste collected by local authorities from households in England was burnt, totaling 11.2m tonnes. This increased from just over 12% a decade earlier, making incineration the largest single municipal waste management method, surpassing recycling and composting.<br><br>The government appears determined to continue increasing waste incineration, stating in its 2018 resources and waste strategy that &quot;Incineration currently plays a significant role in waste management in the UK, and the government expects this to continue.&quot;</p></body></html>
