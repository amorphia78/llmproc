        <h1>Nord Stream leaks: Sabotage to blame, says EU</h1><p>The EU has said leaks in two major gas pipelines from Russia to Europe were caused by sabotage - but stopped short of directly accusing Russia.<br><br>European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said deliberate disruption would meet the &quot;strongest possible response&quot;.<br><br>The EU has previously accused Russia of using gas supplies as a weapon against the West over its support for Ukraine.<br><br>But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed accusations of sabotage as &quot;predictable, stupid and absurd&quot;.<br><br>The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he thought the leaks would &quot;not have a significant impact on Europe&#x27;s energy resilience&quot;. Neither pipeline is transporting gas at the moment, although they both contain gas.<br><br>Mr Blinken did not directly accuse Russia - but said it would be in &quot;no-one&#x27;s interest&quot; if they were caused deliberately.<br><br>The Danish Energy Minister, Dan Jorgensen, said the leaks were likely to last for at least a week, until the gas escaping from the pipes runs out. An investigation has been launched.<br><br>The operators of Nord Stream 2 warned of a loss of pressure in the pipeline on Monday afternoon. That led to Danish authorities saying ships should avoid the area near the island of Bornholm.<br><br>Then on Tuesday, the operator of Nord Stream 1 said the undersea lines had simultaneously sustained &quot;unprecedented&quot; damage in one day.<br><br>The Nord Stream 1 pipeline - which consists of two parallel branches - has not transported any gas since August when Russia closed it down, saying it needed maintenance.<br><br>It stretches 745 miles (1,200km) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. Its twin pipeline, Nord Stream 2, was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine in February.</p>

    <p>Mike Fulwood, a senior research fellow at the independent Oxford Institute for Energy Studies told the BBC sabotage was, indeed, the most likely cause of the leaks.<br><br>&quot;To rupture an offshore pipeline is a rare occurrence, so three in 18 hours would be a big coincidence,&quot; he said.<br><br>If the sabotage was indeed committed by Russia, this was a &quot;bizarre&quot; move, he said, as it had already shut supplies off.<br><br>He estimated that repairs could take between three and six months, as the damaged sections would need to be replaced. Similar damage to a different pipeline in the past took nine months.<br><br>Dmitry Peskov said he was &quot;extremely concerned&quot; about the leaks, adding that the possibility of a deliberate attack could not be ruled out.<br><br>Seismologists reported underwater blasts before the leaks emerged. Denmark&#x27;s Defence Command has released footage of the leaks which shows bubbles - the largest is 1km (0.6 miles) in diameter - at the surface of the Baltic Sea.<br><br>&quot;There is no doubt that these were explosions,&quot; said Bjorn Lund of Sweden&#x27;s National Seismology Centre.<br><br>Greenpeace raised concerns over the leaks, saying they could have the same detrimental impact on the environment as 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.<br><br>But the German environment ministry said the leaks would not pose a significant threat to marine life.</p></body></html>
