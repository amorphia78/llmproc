        <h1>M25 traffic: 78 arrested and drivers delayed after climate activists block parts of motorway in rush hour</h1><h2>Protestors blocked at least five junctions, causing miles of queues along the motorway. Footage shared on social media showed angry drivers attempting to drag the protestors from the road.</h2><p>At least 78 people have been arrested after climate protesters blocked several M25 slip roads, causing significant delays during rush hour. The protesters, from the group Insulate Britain, blocked slip roads at multiple junctions just after 8am on Monday, including junctions 3, 6, 14, 20, and 31.<br><br>Police from Essex, Hertfordshire, Surrey, and Kent responded to the disruptions, making arrests on suspicion of public nuisance and wilful obstruction offences. Superintendent Adam Willmot of Hertfordshire Police stated, &quot;Protesters ignored police requests to move location, so we took robust action to enable roads to be reopened and to remove the protesters causing obstructions.&quot;<br><br>The protests caused miles of queues along the motorway, with one motorist reporting approximately 2.5 miles of queueing clockwise at junction 14. Footage shared on social media showed angry drivers attempting to drag the protesters from the road, while other video footage showed protesters moving to allow an ambulance to pass through.</p>

    <p><br><br>Insulate Britain, a campaign group launched by members of Extinction Rebellion, stated that today&#x27;s disruption was &quot;just the start.&quot; They demand that the government make a meaningful commitment to insulate Britain&#x27;s 29 million leaky homes, which they claim are some of the oldest and most inefficient in Europe.<br><br>However, the AA criticized the protest, with president Edmund King stating, &quot;This action is not only incredibly dangerous in potentially putting lives at risk, but it also backfires in environmental terms by causing more delays and more vehicle emissions.&quot;<br><br>Most of the affected roads have since reopened, but residual delays continue to impact traffic flow on the M25.</p></body></html>
