    <p>Coronation Street&#x27;s Charlie Lawson claims the ITV soap could be axed in ten years due to the rise of streaming services.<br><br>The actor who played notorious criminal Jim McDonald also quipped that viewing figures could have dropped as fans are getting &quot;fed up&quot; with the storylines on the soap.<br><br>Charlie, 63, played the hardman from 1989 until 2000 has made brief cameos since he walked away from the famous Manchester cobbles but believes time could be up.<br><br>The Irish star who is no stranger when it comes to sharing his views said: &quot;I was there in the 90s for 11 years and we were getting between 16 and 20 million – and 5 million (viewers now) is not a lot.<br><br>&quot;In 10 years who knows if we will have a Coronation Street, we&#x27;re all changing our viewing habits as it is already.&quot;<br><br>He also believes that the show will lose viewers due to &quot;politically correct&quot; storylines, including the ongoing issue of Max Turner being groomed by far-right extremists.<br><br>Charlie said: &quot;People are getting a little bit gobsmacked and fed up with all this,&quot; before adding that political correctness is a reason he may not make a return to Weatherfield.<br><br>&quot;Jim wasn&#x27;t exactly politically correct, nevermind woke!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>

    <p>But Charlie also believes that the acting and the script writing during his time on the fan favourite soap was better than today.<br><br>He told the Daily Star: &quot;Do I think it was better in the 80s and 90s? I would have to say yes, that&#x27;s not the cast’s fault. It&#x27;s very hard when you&#x27;ve got 70 people and six episodes to do a week.<br><br>&quot;Good acting is about people talking to each other, it&#x27;s the spoken word.&quot;<br><br>The actor recently became embroiled in a heated exchange as he slammed Just Stop Oil protesters who have recently brought parts of the country to a standstill.<br><br>While appearing on GB News, Charlie discussed the protesters who have also spraypainted several buildings and defaced statues – including pouring excrement over a statue of the late Sir Tom Moore.<br><br>Charlie quipped: &quot;This is starting to wind me up and also I have to say funnily enough the quality of protesters.<br><br>&quot;I mean these people in Kensington or wherever it was today.<br><br>&quot;They are a bunch of time-wasting professionals,&quot; while adding that they should face tougher consequences than the ones they have faced, including a suspended sentence.</p>
