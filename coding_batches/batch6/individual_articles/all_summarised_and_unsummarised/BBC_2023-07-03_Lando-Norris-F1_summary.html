    <p>Lewis Hamilton has been &quot;very inspiring&quot; as Lando Norris has made his way in Formula 1 in recent years, the McLaren driver has said.<br><br>Norris says his relationship with his fellow Briton and seven-time world champion is &quot;growing&quot; and that &quot;over the last couple of months we have been getting to know each other a bit more&quot;.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s a pretty cool thing,&quot; said Norris, 23. &quot;I have so much respect for him and what he&#x27;s been able to achieve in F1.<br><br>&quot;He&#x27;s part of the reason I&#x27;m an F1 driver, so it&#x27;s weird thinking I&#x27;m now racing against him.&quot;<br><br>Norris, who made his debut in 2019 and has established himself as a leading light of the new generation of drivers, said he has been trying to learn from 38-year-old Hamilton.<br><br>&quot;I am not always the guy who asks a lot of questions to these kind of people to get to know what they&#x27;re like and what they think,&quot; Norris added.</p>

    <p><br><br>&quot;I do it in a more subtle way and just try to understand how they think and their thought processes and kind of understand what makes them special.&quot;<br><br>Norris battled with Hamilton on track at the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday, eventually moving clear on his way to a fourth-place finish with help from a five-second penalty for the Mercedes driver for exceeding track limits.<br><br>And he believes he has &quot;good potential&quot; to finish as the leading British driver at his home race at Silverstone this weekend, where McLaren will be running a one-off livery.<br><br>The colour scheme harks back to Hamilton&#x27;s era at McLaren, when the cars ran in silver, by carrying chrome-coloured paintwork on the rear part of the car.<br><br>Norris said the silver colour scheme had &quot;always been my favourite livery - it&#x27;s just for one race but it&#x27;s kind of cool to relive what got me into F1&quot;.</p>
