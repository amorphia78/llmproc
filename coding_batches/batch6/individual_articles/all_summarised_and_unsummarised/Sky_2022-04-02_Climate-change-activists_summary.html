    <p>Climate change activists have entered a network of underground tunnels as they block access to the Navigator and Grays oil terminals in Essex. Protesters from Just Stop Oil have also blocked access to the Titan Truck Park in Essex, which contains more than 100 oil tankers used to service the three main terminals in the area.<br><br>The protesters are demanding that the UK government stops new oil and gas projects. Just Stop Oil posted a photograph of one of their activists inside an underground tunnel at one of the Essex terminals and wrote: &quot;In the tunnel - these people are butting (sic) themselves in danger calling for #NoNewOil - calling on the government to protect us all.&quot;<br><br>The group said its access to the tunnels at the Navigator and Grays sites meant the main and emergency access roads to the oil terminals were closed. Essex Police have now arrested 83 people after two days of protests in the Thurrock district, with 20 of those arrested on Saturday.</p>

I would like to thank businesses, local drivers and workers for their continued patience whilst we carry out our work.&quot;<br><br>Police said arrests were made for offences including aggravated trespass, criminal damage and obstructing the highway. Despite arrests, Just Stop Oil has warned they will be &quot;more disruptive than ever&quot; from next week.</p>
