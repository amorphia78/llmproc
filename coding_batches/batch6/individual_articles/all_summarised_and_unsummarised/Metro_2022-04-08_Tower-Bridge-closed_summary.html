    <p>London&#x27;s Tower Bridge has been shut after eco-protesters hung from ropes and put up a banner saying: &#x27;End fossil fuels now.&#x27;<br><br>Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil activists took over the bridge earlier this morning before abseiling off the sides and set off flares. Protesters also walked into the middle of the road to stop traffic, leading to huge queues in the capital.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion has said it plans to &#x27;get more serious&#x27;, by creating more roadblocks than ever in central London. &#x27;We won&#x27;t have pink boats, we won&#x27;t have pink tables, we will just have people power,&#x27; the environmentalist group said.<br><br>The &#x27;April Rebellion&#x27; is expected to kick off at Speakers&#x27; Corner in Hyde Park tomorrow from 10am, with activists aiming to &#x27;disrupt business as usual&#x27;. Members have been advised to book time off work from then until April 17 and then &#x27;at least&#x27; every weekend until May 8 â€“ in a sign of a stepping-up of protests.</p>

    <p><br><br>XR spokesperson Alanna Byrne told the Big Issue: &#x27;We&#x27;re not going to do it in a big bombastic way this time with lots of infrastructure and colourful things. We&#x27;re trying to get serious and say we&#x27;re not going to go home until the government agrees to immediately end new fossil fuel investments.&#x27;<br><br>The action on Tower Bridge demonstrates the group&#x27;s commitment to their cause, using high-profile locations to draw attention to their demands. By disrupting traffic on one of London&#x27;s most iconic landmarks, the protesters have ensured maximum visibility for their message against fossil fuels.</p>
