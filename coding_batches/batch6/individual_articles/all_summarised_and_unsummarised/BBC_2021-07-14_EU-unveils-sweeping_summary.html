    <p>The European Union has announced a comprehensive set of climate change proposals aimed at achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The package, named &quot;Fit for 55,&quot; includes a dozen draft proposals that need approval from the bloc&#x27;s 27 member states and the EU parliament.<br><br>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated, &quot;By acting now we can do things another way... and choose a better, healthier and more prosperous way for the future.&quot; She emphasized that this is a generational task to secure the wellbeing of current and future generations.<br><br>The proposals include plans to tax jet fuel and effectively ban the sale of petrol and diesel-powered cars within 20 years. These measures are likely to increase household heating bills and the cost of flights in the EU. Financial assistance will be available for people to make long-term changes to their homes, such as installing insulation.<br><br>EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans acknowledged the challenges ahead, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re going to ask a lot of our citizens. We&#x27;re also going to ask a lot of our industries, but we do it for good cause. We do it to give humanity a fighting chance.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The package aims to reduce emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030. By 2019, the EU had already cut its emissions by 24% from 1990 levels.<br><br>Opposition is expected from some industry leaders and eastern member states that rely heavily on coal. Corporate lobby BusinessEurope criticized the plan, saying it &quot;risks destabilising the investment outlook&quot; for various sectors.<br><br>Environmentalist campaigners, however, argue that the proposals don&#x27;t go far enough. Greenpeace EU director Jorgo Riss stated, &quot;This whole package is based on a target that is too low, doesn&#x27;t stand up to science, and won&#x27;t stop the destruction of our planet&#x27;s life-support systems.&quot;<br><br>The EU Commission plans to allocate at least 30% of its â‚¬1.8tn long-term budget to climate-related measures. The success of the package will depend on its ability to be realistic and socially fair while not destabilizing the economy.</p></body></html>
