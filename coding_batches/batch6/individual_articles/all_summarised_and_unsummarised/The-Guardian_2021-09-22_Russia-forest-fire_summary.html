        <h1>Russia forest fire damage worst since records began, says Greenpeace</h1><p>Russia has experienced its most severe forest fire season in modern history, according to recent data from the Russian Forestry Agency analyzed by Greenpeace. Fires have destroyed over 18.16m hectares of Russian forest in 2021, setting an absolute record since satellite monitoring began in 2001. The previous record was set in 2012, with 18.11m hectares burned.<br><br>This record-breaking fire season has produced unprecedented levels of global wildfire emissions and disrupted daily life for hundreds of thousands of people in Siberia and central Russia. Greenpeace Russia stated, &quot;For the past several years, when the area of the fires has surpassed 15m hectares, it has become, in all likelihood, the new normal in the conditions of the new climate reality.&quot;<br><br>The fires have primarily affected Siberian communities, where dry, hot summers have turned vast taiga forests into tinderboxes. In Yakutia, a northern Siberian region, smog covered the capital city Yakutsk for weeks, and villagers fought to save their homes. Varvara, a 63-year-old from the remote village of Teryut, said in July, &quot;Emergency workers have come and villagers are also fighting the fires but they can&#x27;t put them out, they can&#x27;t stop them. Everything is on fire.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The burning forests in Russia contributed significantly to global emissions. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service of the EU found that burning forests released 1.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide last month, the highest since measurements began in 2003. Siberian taiga forests alone pumped 970 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere between June and August.<br><br>Greenpeace Russia reports that fires in Yakutia are continuing, even north of the Arctic Circle, which is unusual for this time of year. The organization warns that climate change will make it more challenging to manage Russia&#x27;s regular peat fires, which have previously enveloped Moscow and other cities in noxious smog.</p></body></html>
