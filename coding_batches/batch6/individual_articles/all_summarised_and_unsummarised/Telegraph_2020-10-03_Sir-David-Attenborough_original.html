        <h1>Sir David Attenborough: 'I've been talking about this for 30 years... and nobody’s taken any notice'</h1><h2>In an exclusive interview ahead of a new book and Netflix film, he discusses Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg and slowing down at 94</h2><p>Davos, January 2019. Not the natural habitat of Sir David Attenborough, but here he is, aged 93, in a suit and tie, addressing a room full of financiers, CEOs and world leaders. He is showing them clips of film, the consequences of our actions upon the natural world: an orangutan clinging to the sole branch of a single tree in what used to be a verdant rainforest; horrific footage of enormous walruses tumbling from cliffs, unable to find anywhere to rest because the retreating sea ice has forced hundreds of them on to one small beach. The audience is visibly moved. In the front row, Christine Lagarde, then head of the IMF, is in tears.<br><br>Attenborough, onstage, comments on the film clips, explaining in his measured, soothing voice, how it has come to this, how we have effectively destroyed our most crucial resources and, most importantly, what can be done about it, what they – sitting in that room, people of influence and power and financial clout – can do about it. The following day he is interviewed on stage by the Duke of Cambridge, and there is a standing ovation.<br><br>There is a clip of this event in the new film A Life on Our Planet, which, along with the accompanying book, is effectively David Attenborough’s last stand. He calls it his ‘witness statement’.<br><br>And he is indeed a unique witness – David Attenborough is in the extraordinary position of having seen more of the natural world than probably anyone else, in a career that began in the holocene age – the 12,000- year geological period of climatic stability when wildlife was still profuse – at a point when access to it, via international travel, had just become easy. Since then, the human population has tripled, and the number of wild animals, once prolific, has halved. And the planet is one degree warmer – which may not sound like much, but it is a speed of change that exceeds any in the last 10,000 years.<br><br>As Attenborough noted in his Davos speech: ‘We are in a new geological age: the anthropocene, the age of humans.&#x27;<br><br>‘We just need a new perspective – which is, try not to take out from the sea and the land more than the Earth can recover,’ says the familiar voice, lightly muffled by technical problems of a Zoom call, deepened by age, but nonetheless unmistakably Attenborough. He is speaking from his home in Richmond, Surrey, where he has been grounded for months – interrupting the making of several projects, one on extinction for the BBC, and many with the word ‘Planet’ in their title. A Life on Our Planet had been about to premiere at the Royal Albert Hall in April, it was going to be the biggest release of a documentary in the history of British cinema, but all that was put on hold by lockdown. How did he cope with that?<br><br>‘I feel diffident about saying this because I have to bear in mind that I’m not a married couple with a young child, because that must be desperate, but I’ve been very lucky: I’ve had a peaceful time. I have a garden and I live close to Richmond Park, so I’ve got a lot to keep me happy. I watched the spring unfold and develop more closely than I have been able to do for decades – and what a joy it was.<br><br>‘My daughter Susan lives in the same house and looks after things, and keeps it running. I had overseas trips organised that have been cancelled, so I’ve not spent time whizzing around the place, but I’ve had a lot of writing to do.’<br><br>There is no sign of him slowing down. He managed lockdown restrictions by recording the commentaries to his next BBC venture, A Perfect Planet, ‘sitting in my dining room with a microphone on the dining table and eiderdowns on the wall to combat the reverberation, and the recordist sitting in the garden in the rain under an umbrella… And that’s quite a nice way of doing things, after a respectable breakfast, instead of having to get into a car and go to a studio at 7.30 am.’<br><br>The Cairngorms was the last place he visited, last winter, and he does not miss flying. ‘Not at all. I feel embarrassed to say this because a lot of people have had a very, very rough time and I feel very sympathetic to the young who want to get around and see the world and go to parties, but when you get into your 80s and 90s you are more contemplative and quite happy to sit in the shade and think about life, which is mainly what I’ve been doing.’<br><br>And this is what he has come up with, what he always comes up with, what he has been showing us over and over again, for years and years and years: that nature is our biggest ally. Take care of nature, and nature will take care of us.<br><br>We’ve reached a tipping-point’ has become a battle cry that we’ve heard so often over the last decade that there is a danger of tipping-point fatigue. But you only have to look at the recent news – uncontrollable wildfires in Brazil, California and Oregon that have destroyed towns and communities and displaced half a million people; hurricanes and flash floods of overwhelming strength and frequency threatening the Gulf Coast. The rainforest is still being cut down faster than ever – 3.8 million hectares are cleared annually, that’s 15 billion trees a year – and as we all know by now, our planet is losing its ice: since satellite records began in 1979, summer sea ice has reduced by 40 per cent.<br><br>Only last month, WWF reported that wildlife populations are down by two-thirds in less than 50 years. And when a UN panel asked 455 experts to investigate the state of the Earth, they discovered that one million species (out of an estimated eight million) are at risk of extinction – that is, 100 times faster than would happen in the normal course of events.<br><br>But, says Attenborough, it’s not too late to change things, or at least to ameliorate them. The science is all there, the technology is there, the political will ought to be there, but the difficulty is in making people care. And this is where David Attenborough comes in – he makes people care.<br><br>Perhaps it is the voice, the poetic intonation, the gently erudite manner, the heft of knowledge – but there are reasons why David Attenborough has become the most popular broadcaster in the world. We trust him: he never reads anyone else’s scripts or does any advertising; you won’t catch him sponsoring water filters or lending his name to a new line of paper straws. He had to maintain a level of impartiality when he was broadcasting on behalf of the BBC and he was relatively quiet about climate change until he was absolutely sure of the science.<br><br>‘There were a lot of people in the environmental world who were pushing David to speak out harder earlier,’ says Colin Butfield of WWF, whose idea it was for Attenborough to address Davos, ‘but he did what was typical of David – which is to make absolutely sure that he understood the science well. He completely immersed himself in it before he was willing to speak his mind.’<br><br>Attenborough mildly contradicts this. ‘I’ve been talking about this for 30 years!’ he exclaims. ‘And nobody’s taken any notice! If you look back you would find that certainly into the late ’70s there wasn’t a single series that I made where I didn’t end up talking about what we ought to be doing in terms of looking after the planet, and what the dangers were.’<br><br>Now, his new book, authored with filmmaker and science writer Jonnie Hughes, who has worked with him for years and also co-directed the film, brings all of this together. It is a succinct homage to nature told through Attenborough’s remarkable personal history, looking at the state of the world through chapters of his life. As he puts it, it is ‘the story of how we came to make our greatest mistake and how – if we act now – we can put it right.’<br><br>And there are many examples of governments making successful inroads into sustainability: Iceland, Paraguay and Albania already generate all their electricity without using fossil fuels; and who knew that Morocco has the largest solar farm in the world, providing 40 per cent of its needs? Or that Costa Rica has now replenished half of the rainforest it had cut down by the ’70s? Research has shown that marine life could regenerate at an incredible rate if just 30% of the ocean were protected. And there is hope for wildlife: in Attenborough’s lifetime, mountain gorillas have made a huge comeback in east Africa; and sightings of blue whales, hunted down to the last one per cent of their population until whaling was banned in 1986, have exceeded all expectations.<br><br>Did it make him nostalgic, going through the archives and seeing the world as it used to be? ‘What I’m nostalgic for – if I can twist the word slightly – are things that I’ve never seen. If you read books about travelling in Africa a century ago, you realise how impoverished the continent has become – there were herds of thousands of animals, animals like quaggas (half zebra, half antelope); stories of building railways amongst marauding lions. Wildlife was pullulating, and the oceans were so rich. The wealth of the natural world in the 19th century was overwhelmingly munificent, and that’s all gone.’<br><br>‘Pullulating’ and ‘munificent’ – talking to Attenborough draws you straight into his lyrical, carefully written commentaries. ‘Well I’ve been writing narrations for a long time, for 50 or 60 years – and actually, I’ve learned that fewer words is better. I take a lot of trouble writing them.’ George Fenton, who composed the music for many of his early series, would treat his words like the main character in a drama, working the music around the inflections of his voice.<br><br>The voice has changed over the years, certainly. Its pitch has lowered and become more ragged, but it has lost none of its enthusiasm, whether he is exclaiming over the dancing prowess of the mantis shrimp or the octopus that can walk across land. And he’s not above poking fun at himself, it was in that distinctive voice that he narrated an Adele video during an interview on Radio 1; he also made a documentary with Björk about the intersection between nature and music. He’s had at least 20 species named after him and more honorary degrees from UK universities than anyone else, as well as countless awards. When he joined Instagram nine days ago, he broke the record for reaching a million followers – just over four hours (a record previously held by Jennifer Anniston).<br><br>David Attenborough was born in 1926 when the natural world was in a benign state, in Isleworth. He was the middle of three brothers – and now the only survivor. His older brother, film producer and actor Sir Richard Attenborough, died six years ago, and his younger brother John died in 2012.</p><p>He won a scholarship to study natural sciences at Cambridge in 1945, after which he did national service in the navy then joined the television business in 1952, as a producer. He became a broadcaster almost by accident, stepping in when a presenter, a zookeeper called Jack Lester, became ill. Attenborough and a cameraman were sent off on expeditions to find rare creatures and bring them back to be paraded on television, whereupon they would be dispatched to London Zoo.<br><br>He laughs now when he remembers the simplicity of those days, before the idea of health and safety was conceived. ‘The first trip I made was in 1954, when television was a tiny little hick organisation up in Alexandra Palace, and I remember going to see the man who looked after the administration of my department, and saying, “I’m off to Indonesia for three months.” “Oh yes,” he said, “what’s it going to be?” And I said, “We’re going to look for birds of paradise and things called Komodo dragons. About six half-hour programmes. We’ll be back by Christmas.” And off we went – we had a marvellous time and made these rather bad programmes.’<br><br>That was Zoo Quest, to be followed by several other series of increasing sophistication – and in 1965 he became controller of BBC2, then director of programmes for the BBC (where he commissioned key series such as Civilisation, The Ascent of Man and Monty Python’s Flying Circus) and he was mooted for the job of director general in 1972. Instead, he decided to devote all his time to making programmes about the natural world.<br><br>Life on Earth was his first ambitious, pioneering series – and it included the famous encounter in Rwanda between a young, laughing Attenborough lying on the ground and a mountain gorilla called Poppy sitting on top of him. ‘There are so many more now than when we first filmed them in the 1970s,&#x27; he says. &#x27;Every now and again, you see a thing like that and your little heart says, well at least we did something.’<br><br>His team went to 39 countries, filmed 650 species and covered 1.5 million miles for Life on Earth. It was watched by an estimated 500,000 people, and was, he says, the best time of his life. It was followed by many award winning series and one-offs including The Life of Birds, Blue Planet and Frozen Planet. His last series, Our Planet, which came out on Netflix last year (and is now free on YouTube), has been downloaded 700 million times globally. And he has recently contributed to another film directed specifically at financial institutions – Our Planet: Too Big To Fail, a collaboration between Netflix and WWF, and featuring Mark Carney (now UN special envoy for climate action and finance).<br><br>A Life on Our Planet (which opened in 550 UK cinemas last week – a huge number for a documentary – and will be available on Netflix tomorrow) is unusual in that Attenborough appears in person, close up, talking directly to camera in a way that’s almost confessional; it is moving and intense. The film was privately funded by donors from WWF, ‘and that was very important to us,’ says the co-director, Alastair Fothergill, a long-term collaborator, ‘because we wanted to give David total editorial control, and inevitably with any broadcaster you can lose that. He was very personally involved in the film, and it shows a side of David you&#x27;re never normally exposed to – he’s a classic, buttoned-up Englishman, but he is quite emotional in this film, which I don’t think anybody’s seen before.’<br><br>Attenborough lives with his daughter, Susan, formerly a teacher. His wife Jane died in 1997, after suffering a brain haemorrhage when he was filming in New Zealand. He has never remarried. His son is Dr Robert Attenborough, a professor of biological anthropology at Cambridge University.<br><br>He lives simply, in the house he has had for years; he has no iPhone or email, he uses the post, and occasionally a computer. He had a knee operation six years ago, which enabled him to continue working, but he doesn’t exercise. ‘I’ve never taken exercise in my life’. And he doesn’t eat meat. ‘I haven’t eaten meat in a long time. It just went away – I can’t explain it. It wasn’t that I made a sacrifice or anything – for some reason I just went off it decades ago.’ Perhaps it was the revelation that, as mentioned in the book, 60 per cent of mammals in the world are livestock, and we consume 50 billion chickens a year – most of which are fed on soy-based feed derived from deforested land.<br><br>The film and book are at their most brutal when he outlines what could be in store for someone born today, at our current rate of progress: the rain forest would turn into a dry savannah, fish populations would crash, the methane produced by frozen soil thawing would accelerate climate change and large parts of the planet would become uninhabitable.  But, he says now: ‘I do believe that things are changing, and it is young people who are most vigorous and vocal at the moment – young people who will get older and take direct action, and the fact that they are as energised and concerned as they are is very good news.’<br><br>He has nothing but good things to say about Greta Thunberg, who he spent some time with last year. ‘I think she’s absolutely extraordinary, and she’s very realistic about the issues; she is very modest and the first to say, we must listen to the science – don’t listen to me, I’m not a scientist, but it is my future nonetheless. And she says this with such power, and with such clarity that she is a very powerful voice, and that voice will last and resonate for much longer than mine, because she’s 75 years younger.’<br><br>He is keen that protests should be heard, but is ambivalent about Extinction Rebellion. ‘The question is, are they putting people off by disturbing lives? I think it’s important that people should have their voices heard, that’s for sure, but I think breaking the law can have a deleterious effect.’<br><br>Attenborough is a modest man and deflects any attempt at analysing his legacy. ‘What people will remember me for is the films, and what makes the films is the camera and directors, and big, big teams. I’ve had a simply phenomenal time – I can’t believe how lucky I’ve been and my successors won’t be as lucky because the stuff just won’t be there.’<br><br>He doesn’t have to be doing this: he could quite easily retire, he says. ‘But I’ve had unbelievable luck and good fortune and I would feel so guilty if I recognised the problems and decided to ignore them.’<br><br>In such a long career with so many memorable moments, when was he happiest? ‘Going to Africa for the very first time, in 1960, was unforgettable; and going to the South American rainforest, or swimming on a coral reef for the first time, or seeing a bird of paradise display – all those were revelations. People say that you don’t get used to things like that – but you do get used to them. There is a freshness when you go to one of those places for the first time that is unrepeatable.’<br><br>Does he still come across things that surprise him about the natural world? ‘Well, I’m discovering more new things all the time, because that’s the pleasure of natural history. Nobody will ever know all there is to know about natural history and certainly things I read about now are new to me. But mostly, lately, it’s been about reviving memories and knowledge that I had in my teens – seeing things again because I’ve had the time. Instead of dashing around in aeroplanes, I’ve had time to watch willows put out their catkins.’<br><br>I ask him if there is anything out there that he would still like to see, ‘Oh, lots of things.’ He thinks for a moment. ‘There are a couple of species of birds of paradise that I haven’t seen’, he says. ‘I won’t be able to now because that would involve walking for days and days through very thick undergrowth, which I can’t do any more, but I wish I had seen them.’ He warms to his theme and his voice takes on a different timbre; there is poetry, and yearning. ‘There is this newly discovered species that has been found in the last few years, and it happens to be a family of birds, which – in a funny, silly, irrational way – is full of drama and excitement and beautiful romance and one thing and another, and I just love them.<br><br>‘But when you get older you become more stoic. I’m perfectly happy sitting in my garden watching the spring. When you’re 94, sitting in the garden watching the spring is a very nice thing to do.’<br><br>Attenborough reunited with HM (he produced her Christmas address between 1986 and 1991) in 2018 for The Queen’s Green Planet, to draw attention to the need to protect forests. In the gardens of Buckingham Palace, they discuss everything from conkers to climate change.<br><br>In an very moving sequence from Africa (2013), Attenborough is seen befriending and feeding a blind baby rhino called Nicky, then getting down on all fours to communicate with him.<br><br>For the pioneering series Life on Earth (1979), Attenborough visits the mountain gorillas of Rwanda; and the resulting footage has been voted one of the top TV moments of all time. One gorilla opens Attenborough’s mouth and has a look, and two baby gorillas try to take off his shoes.<br><br>Attenborough fulfils a lifelong ambition of seeing a blue whale up close, and his excitement in The Life of Mammals (2002) is palpable as the vast creature surfaces metres from his boat.<br><br>In Galapagos 3D (2013), Attenborough meets Lonesome George, a giant tortoise who was the last of his subspecies – they spent half an hour alone together. George died two weeks later, aged 100.<br><br>David Attenborough has had at least 20 species named after him – here are a few:<br><br>Butterfly: Euptychia Attenboroughi<br><br>Known as Attenborough’s Black-Eyed Satyr, found in the upper Amazon basin in Venezuela and Brazil<br><br>Flat lizard: Platysaurus Attenboroughi<br><br>First lizard to be named after Attenborough, found in the Northern Cape and southern Namibia<br><br>Rubber frog: Pristimantis Attenboroughi<br><br>Tiny frog found in the Peruvian Andes, the first amphibian to be named after Attenborough<br><br>Weevil: Trigonopterus Attenboroughi<br><br>Flightless weevil found in Java, Bali and Lombok<br><br>Goblin Spider: Prethopalpus Attenboroughi<br><br>Tiny spider found only on Horn Island, off the coast of Queensland, Australia<br><br>A Life on Our Planet: My Witness Statement and Vision for the Future by David Attenborough (Witness Books, £20), is out now; books.telegraph.co.uk</p></body></html>
