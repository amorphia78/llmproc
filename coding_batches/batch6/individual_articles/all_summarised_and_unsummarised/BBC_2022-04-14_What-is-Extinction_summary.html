    <p>Protest group Extinction Rebellion (XR) is carrying out a week of demonstrations to highlight what it says is government inaction on climate change. On Wednesday, some protesters glued themselves to the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) over the government&#x27;s commitment to keep drilling for North Sea oil and gas.<br><br>Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the group via social media: &quot;You cannot - and we won&#x27;t - switch off domestic oil and gas production.&quot; XR Scientists - the sub-group protesting at BEIS - has accused the government of &quot;irresponsible and dangerous pursuit&quot; of fossil fuels, which is incompatible with climate change.<br><br>The group describes itself as an international &quot;non-violent civil disobedience&quot; movement.

Government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.<br><br>3. Government must create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens&#x27; Assembly on climate and ecological justice.<br><br>The group often uses disruptive tactics to highlight its demands. Police made 480 arrests during protests in London last year. Across a two-week period in August and September, activists blocked Oxford Circus and erected a giant table in Covent Garden. More than 130 people locked or glued themselves to roads and buildings.<br><br>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has accused the group of being &quot;crusties&quot; who block the streets and cause disruption. However, younger people are most likely to agree with its aims, according to a survey of more than 3,000 people carried out after the London 2019 protests.</p></body></html>
