    <p>Two Just Stop Oil protestors who scaled a bridge over the Dartford Crossing and caused 40 hours of gridlock have been jailed for five years in a record sentence for the climate group.<br><br>Morgan Trowland, 40, and Marcus Decker, 36, blocked one of the busiest stretches of road in the country during their climate protest on October 17 last year.<br><br>The pair hoisted a banner between two pillars of the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, which links the M25 in Essex and Kent, and slept in hammocks in freezing temperatures overnight.<br><br>The road beneath was closed by police for fears over their safety, causing traffic chaos - they were eventually arrested after coming down the following day.<br><br>Trowland and Decker were jailed for three years, and two years and seven months respectively yesterday at Southend Crown Court, after being found guilty of causing a public nuisance.<br><br>Passing sentence yesterday, judge Shane Collery KC said locking the pair up would hopefully deter anyone else from taking part in similar demonstrations.<br><br>&#x27;You have to be punished for the chaos you caused and to deter others from copying you,&#x27; he said.<br><br>The judge said that Trowland, who has six previous convictions relating to protests, had a &#x27;leading role&#x27;, while Decker had one previous conviction relating to a protest.<br><br>The judge said that the pair &#x27;plainly believed you knew better than everyone else&#x27;, adding: &#x27;In short, to hell with everyone else.&#x27;<br><br>&#x27;By your actions you caused this very important road to be closed for 40 hours,&#x27; the judge said, noting that the disruption affected &#x27;many tens of thousands, some very significantly&#x27;.<br><br>Praising the sentences, Conservative MP Gareth Johnson - whose Dartford constituency covers the bridge - said: &#x27;As far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s not a day too long for either of them.<br><br>&#x27;They caused untold misery to residents in Dartford and beyond. I had constituents unable to make hospital appointments or pick up children from school or get about their normal lives.&#x27; Just Stop Oil claimed it would &#x27;not be deterred by these draconian sentences&#x27;.<br><br>But Stephanie Golder, a Just Stop Oil spokesperson, said outside court that she was &#x27;horrified&#x27; by the ruling.<br><br>&#x27;I think the judge was trying to set a precedent,&#x27; she said.<br><br>&#x27;He&#x27;s trying to deter people but we are not to be deterred because until the Government commits to no new oil and gas we will continue in our campaign of resistance.<br><br>&#x27;It wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all. I felt tearful, emotional.<br><br>&#x27;But what makes me feel tearful is the fact we&#x27;re going to be dealing with millions and potentially billions of climate refugees in the next 20, 30 years.<br><br>&#x27;That&#x27;s what drives me, and that&#x27;s likely what drives Morgan and Marcus.&#x27;<br><br>Prosecutor Adam King said the bridge was closed from 4am on October 17 last year to 9pm the following day, with jams as traffic was forced to use the tunnels instead.<br><br>Both defendants were found guilty by unanimous verdicts of causing a public nuisance, following an earlier trial at Basildon Crown Court.<br><br>The pair had been in custody since they were remanded at their first appearance at magistrates&#x27; court some six months ago, on October 20 in Southend.<br><br>Prosecutor Mr King said that the protesters ascended to a point close to 200ft above the road and unfurled a &#x27;giant Just Stop Oil banner&#x27; and &#x27;rigged up hammocks and stayed there&#x27;.<br><br>&#x27;This closure caused gridlock for miles around throughout that period, which we say was the point,&#x27; said Mr King.<br><br>He said the men came down at about 5.30pm on October 18 &#x27;with the help of police and a very tall cherry picker crane&#x27;, but the bridge was not reopened to traffic until later.<br><br>Trowland, of Islington, north London, and Decker, 34, of no fixed address, had denied causing a public nuisance, arguing that it was a protest.</p>

    <p>Essex Police said that those impacted by the traffic disruption included a &#x27;heavily pregnant woman who needed urgent medical help&#x27;.<br><br>Another person missed the funeral of their best friend of 35 years, the force said, and a business lost more than Â£160,000 in earnings.<br><br>Jacob Bindman, for Trowland, said: &#x27;He&#x27;s able to say this protest, and his experience of having spent time in prison, largely represents the end of his involvement in this kind of activity.<br><br>&#x27;He doesn&#x27;t intend to undertake any large-scale disruptive protests in the future.&#x27;<br><br>He said that structural engineer Trowland had &#x27;in his words done his bit&#x27; and &#x27;he doesn&#x27;t want to spend the rest of his days going in and out of prison&#x27;.<br><br>Rebecca Martin, for Decker, said that the protest &#x27;wasn&#x27;t his idea&#x27; and that the &#x27;expert in climbing&#x27; was not part of the initial planning process.<br><br>She said that both private tutor Decker, who is a German citizen with two degrees, and his co-defendant were &#x27;trying to act for the greater good in the long term&#x27;.<br><br>Ms Martin said Decker would also not take part in further disruptive protests.<br><br>But the judge said he saw &#x27;no signs&#x27; the defendants were &#x27;any less committed to the causes you espouse than before&#x27;.<br><br>During the pair&#x27;s trial, Mr King said: &#x27;This closure caused gridlock for miles around. It was because of the disruption that the incident made national news.<br><br>&#x27;Small businesses lost, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of pounds, people missed loved ones&#x27; funerals, children were left on the side of the road waiting for buses.&#x27;<br><br>He said the men came down at about 5.30pm on October 18 &#x27;with the help of police and a very tall cherry picker crane&#x27;, but the bridge was not reopened to traffic until later.<br><br>Trowland had said in evidence: &#x27;We climbed it to deliver a warning message and to speak that message through interviews with journalists.&#x27; He said the group&#x27;s goal is to get the Government to stop licensing oil and gas production.<br><br>Speaking before his sentencing Trowland said: &#x27;Marcus and I demonstrated what any two ordinary people will do, when the death screams of the world become unbearable.<br><br>&#x27;I cannot enjoy liberty in a society when our government makes plans to kill people on a massive scale. Drilling new oil and gas wells in 2023 means death for many of the most vulnerable on earth. I will not be complicit in that.&#x27;<br><br>In a statement outside the court Ms Golder said Just Stop Oil would not be put off protesting by the jail sentences.<br><br>Stephanie Golder said: &#x27;What Morgan and Marcus did was extraordinary, risky and extremely disruptive. But what should you do when your government refuses to protect the people? When it ignores the repeated warnings of the world&#x27;s climate scientists. When you know that new oil and gas extraction will eventually result in the deaths of billions of people?&#x27;<br><br>&#x27;Nonviolent civil resistance is the answer. It&#x27;s what the Suffragettes did, it&#x27;s what the Civil Rights movements did. It&#x27;s our best chance of getting the scale of change we need, in the time we need it.&#x27;<br><br>&#x27;Just Stop Oil will not be deterred by these draconian sentences. Where they imprison one of us, ten more will take their place. When they imprison ten of us, one hundred will stand to take their place. We must unite against this genocidal government and be brave.&#x27;<br><br>&#x27;For now, that means slowly marching around the streets of London. It is an act of self respect, an act of solidarity, an act of love and necessity. We urge you to join us, because together we can stop the harm that is new oil and gas. Our campaign resumes on April 24th.&#x27;</p>
