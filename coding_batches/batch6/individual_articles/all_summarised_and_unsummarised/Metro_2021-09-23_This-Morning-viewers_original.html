    <p>Sorry, this video isn&#x27;t available any more.<br><br>This Morning viewers were left astonished when a guest appeared on the programme to raise awareness of climate change in a unique way, sitting naked on the sofa in the studio.<br><br>Laura Amherst, a protester for Extinction Rebellion, was invited onto Thursday’s edition of This Morning to speak to Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby about why she uses her bold method to bring attention to her cause.<br><br>The banner on the TV screen about Laura stated: ‘I protest topless to help save the planet,’ as the activist told Phillip and Holly that in an ideal world, people would listen to what she had to say about climate change straight away, and so she wouldn’t need to go to extreme lengths to get their attention.<br><br>Laura was asked for her views on environmental group Insulate Britain, who have sparked controversy after shutting down the M25 several times, causing major disruption and ‘endangering people’s lives’, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.<br><br>Saying that she wished to stay ‘neutral’ on Insulate Britain, Laura stressed that Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain are two separate organisations, adding that while Insulate Britain are promoting an important message about damage to the environment, they ‘should be held responsible for their actions’.<br><br>While Phillip and Holly questioned Laura about her activism, some viewers watching the show expressed their shock over Laura making an appearance stark naked, with several questioning if there was any sort of blanket or cover on the couch.<br><br>‘Is she fully naked I hope they dettol the sofa afterwards,’ one person tweeted, while another asked: ‘#ThisMorning is her bare bottom on that sofa?’<br><br>‘Sorry but…is her hooha just nakedly sat on that couch? Philip doesn’t know where to look,’ another said.<br><br>‘The producers could have covered that bit of the sofa with clingfilm or tarpaulin before the lady sat down #This morning,’ someone else wrote.<br><br>@thismorning This naked protest woman is doing more harm than good to the climate campaign. Campaigns should focus on the serious issues rather than some woman taking her clothes off, which has no connection to climate change issues. #ThisMorning</p>

Speaking so well, so calmly and simply asking that you think about the cause and why these actions to draw attention and disrupt are neccesary.

Speaking so well, so calmly and simply asking that you think about the cause and why these actions to draw attention and disrupt are necessary.
