    <p>Intervening on Ms Patel, Conservative MP Lee Anderson suggested that environmental protesters should be put to work &quot;seven days a week&quot; as punishment for disruptive tactics.<br><br>&quot;The Public Order Bill, as she (Home Secretary) knows, will be music to the ears of many residents in Ashfield. We have seen these eco-whatever-they-are with their little hammers smashing petrol stations up.<br><br>&quot;Does she think it is a good idea that we should give them bigger hammers, some tools, and put them to work seven days a week like the rest of us?&quot;<br><br>Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player<br><br>But the bill is not without its criticism. Green MP Caroline Lucas is among those who have vowed to work with other parties to defeat the legislation.<br><br>Meanwhile, the government says its British Bill of Rights - which will replace the Human Rights Act - will &quot;end the abuse of the human rights framework and restore some common sense to our justice system&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Crucially, the Bill of Rights will restore public confidence and curb the abuse of the human rights framework by criminals,&quot; Ms Patel told the Commons.<br><br>The home secretary added: &quot;Human rights are not something that should only be extended to criminals. In what has to be the most twisted logic I have seen, as home secretary, I have lost count of the number of representations I have received from immigration lawyers and Labour members opposite begging me not to deport dangerous foreign criminals.&quot;<br><br>Ms Patel added that while the UK is a &quot;hospitable&quot; country, &quot;our capacity to support over 18 million people worldwide who are on the move is not limitless&quot;.<br><br>&quot;That is why we have developed our world-leading migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda to deter illegal entry,&quot; she continued.<br><br>&quot;We are providing solutions to the global migration challenges countries across the world are facing.&quot;<br><br>Ms Patel signed a deal in the capital Kigali in April for some asylum seekers who have arrived in the UK illegally since January to be resettled in the east African country.<br><br>Meanwhile, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused the government of not preventing crime, telling MPs: &quot;Crime is rising but there has been a shocking drop in prosecutions.&quot;<br><br>She also argued that the Home Office &quot;has effectively been put into special measures because it cannot get the basics right&quot;.</p></body></html>
