    <p>SUSPECTED protest ringleader Roger Hallam pledged to &quot;organise the coming revolution&quot; with a lover half his age from the spare room of their flat. Cops raided the London flat on Sunday after a Sun investigation revealed Just Stop Oil&#x27;s plans to blockade the M25. Hallam, 56, was later arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit public nuisance.<br><br>German Frieda Luerken, 24, is said to have helped Hallam found Extinction Rebellion before they started Insulate Britain as a &quot;lockdown lovechild&quot;. Hallam bragged online: &quot;Myself and my partner Frieda are now in a permanent rented flat. It has a spare room in which to organise the coming revolution. It is perfect. But I need money to afford it.&quot;<br><br>Sources say Frieda, who was studying psychology at Cardiff when the couple met, has &quot;incredible influence&quot; on Hallam. They lived together in London while Hallam studied disruptive campaigns at King&#x27;s College London as part of a PhD.</p>

    <p><br><br>Cops yesterday foiled plans by eco-protesters to shut the M25, Britain&#x27;s busiest motorway. Twenty-three people were held after the Just Stop Oil campaigners climbed gantries over the M25, hoping to disrupt journeys for tens of thousands of motorists. They glued and locked themselves on to sign structures at 13 locations from 7.30am, having boasted it would be &quot;biggest demonstration in British history&quot;.<br><br>Six forces from across the South East created a ring of steel around London&#x27;s orbital motorway, used by up to 200,000 motorists every day. Specialist teams were already in place, including officers with climbing equipment and cherry pickers so any protesters could be quickly removed.<br><br>Met Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said the climate change group&#x27;s action was further curtailed in its scope by the advance arrests of seven ­suspected ringleaders after a Sun investigation revealed their plans.</p>
