    <p>The perimeter fences topped with barbed wire have long gone – along with the menacing lookout towers.<br><br>And now the most striking sound to be to be heard within the old air base they guarded is the song of ground-nesting Dartford warblers.<br><br>But nearly 40 years ago, other songs echoed on this spot and reverberated across the world.<br><br>Now quiet Berkshire parkland with only one gate left as a reminder, Greenham Common was renowned as the home of the Women’s Peace Camp, the world’s longest-running anti-nuclear demonstration.<br><br>It began in September 1981 when 36 members of a peace movement Women for Life on Earth – set up in response to the Cold War arms race – arrived at the gates after a 120-mile march from Cardiff.<br><br>Soon that number would grow to 30,000 united in protest against Margaret Thatcher’s plans to bring American cruise missiles to Britain.<br><br>Do you remember the threat of nuclear war? Join the discussion in the comment section<br><br>And for three sisters from the Welsh Valleys, recollections of those days are still very much alive - memories they hope will inspire generations of activists against the new world threat of climate change.<br><br>“It taught me that you take your voice and you use it whenever you can,” says Susan Lamb, 68, who joined the camp with siblings Lesley Brinkworth and Christine King.<br><br>“I was just a housewife from the Rhondda, terrified what could happen to our children. We had to stand up for what we believed in, just as groups like Extinction Rebellion are doing now.”<br><br>The women – whose story is told in a new BBC documentary – had little notion of the global attention they would receive, or the sacrifices that would follow.<br><br>They were slung in jail, threatened by anti-protest vigilantes – and Susan and Christine, 65, were even part of a group who took US President Ronald Reagan to court.<br><br>“I was a different person at Greenham,” their sister Lesley, 63, admits. “We learned to face our fears and that if people come together we can change the world.”<br><br>In the early Eighties, the shadow of nuclear war loomed large, with “Protect and Survive” pamphlets sent out advising families to create bunkers out of doors and cushions. “We couldn’t live under this threat. Or let nuclear weapons in to kill our children” says Susan, then pregnant.<br><br>Then the sisters heard of the march from a Cardiff weapons factory to Greenham to protest against US plans to store cruise missiles at the base.<br><br>When the Women for Life on Earth’s journey failed to make the impact protesters hoped for, they set up camp there, with a small group chaining themselves to a fence. Determined to spread the word, the sisters set up their own local demo, joined by friends and activists.<br><br>“We camped a week in the middle of Porth square, a main thoroughfare in the Rhondda Valley,” says Christine, who still lives there.<br><br>They expected to be evicted. “We came with two shower curtains for shelter then local builders dropped off water and a hut for us to sleep in,” says Lesley, who now lives near Tonypandy in Glamorgan.<br><br>“On the last day we camped it was pouring down but I thought, ‘Oh my God, this is the best night of my life’.” Weeks later they were at Greenham, where protestors lived in cars and tents, without electricity or running water. “We had a crèche caravan where all the children went,” says Susan. “We met people from all over the world. It didn’t matter what class or politics they were – we were united to get the cruise weapons out.”</p>

    <p>In 1982, the sisters were part of a group of 23 women who stormed the entrance of Greenham base. They were jailed for 14 days for breaching the peace. Christine, who was also pregnant, says: “They were planning on fighting a nuclear war, my child wouldn’t have a future.”<br><br>Lesley adds: “It was outrageous to lock up housewives for protesting. My clothes were sent to my family home from prison with no note. They thought something had happened to me. My mother’s hair turned white overnight.” Defiant, they returned to Greenham for 10-day stretches each month.<br><br>In 1983 they were among thousands of women who formed a human chain around the airfield in an “Embrace the Base” demo. It marked one of Lesley’s most terrifying ordeals there.<br><br>“I remember joyous singing, but how quickly it changed,” she says. “A policeman grabbed my head and the next thing I’m flying through the air. Had I landed differently I’m sure he’d have broken my neck.”<br><br>There were threats women who entered the base would be shot. Vigilantes even set light to woods near the camp and poured farm slurry over women. Bailiffs tore down tents up to twice a day.<br><br>Camp members went on night watch. Greenham ended Lesley’s marriage. “He didn’t like me going there. I think he thought, ‘Someone else’s wife can do that’. But Greenham gave me independence.”<br><br>In November 1983, shortly before the missiles arrived, Christine and Susan were in a group who flew to America to lodge a case in New York’s Supreme Court against Reagan. They argued the deployment was illegal since the missiles were designed to be used first in response to conventional conflict.<br><br>The court said the case was outside its jurisdiction. The first missile arrived days later, flooring the sisters and their friends.<br><br>In 1985, Susan had to stop protesting after Crohn’s disease left her housebound. But four years later came the news all Greenham women had been waiting for. The missiles were leaving.<br><br>“Our pressure forced the Government’s arm, no doubt about it,” says Susan. “We had won.” Since then Lesley has worked for years with families with specialist needs.<br><br>Susan, now in Pembrokeshire, went on to study a masters in women’s development, before working for support groups. She still attends demos, this time with her grandchildren. “I brought the kids up to be interested in the world,” she says. “When I left school I didn’t have a lot of self-belief.<br><br>“Greenham changed the way I see myself.” Her only regret is its legacy didn’t stop the Trident programme. “I thought we’d have got rid of it by now,” she says. “We need to be re-making that case.<br><br>“Because of Greenham I learned I could change the world. I hope future generations are inspired and do just that.”</p>
