    <p>A TOPLESS eco-warrior has taken her campaign one step further and completely bared all at Downing Street as she demands the “naked truth”.<br><br>Laura Amherst, 31, stripped down to just rainbow striped socks and trainers to protest outside of No 10 - even ranting at security guards.<br><br>The mum-of-one used signs and placards to cover up some of her modesty while demonstrating outside of the Prime Minister&#x27;s home.<br><br>She hopes to encourage Boris Johnson and the government to set a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2025 and she also wants them to address animal agriculture.<br><br>Laura also posted footage online of her telling security guards that she is not breaking any laws by “trying to save the planet”.<br><br>She said: &quot;They were trying to threaten me telling me I’m breaking the law and harming children.<br><br>&quot;It makes me so angry.&quot;<br><br>Posting on Instagram, Laura said she was unable to share the images on social media as she worried that they would be removed for breaking guidelines, but she felt compelled to take another stand.</p>

    <p>She said: &quot;Drastic measures were put in place in war time and in Covid- yet not to stop extinction? The messages are not sinking in that this is an EMERGENCY.<br><br>&quot;What is it going to take for people to wake up, and do what needs to be done?&quot;<br><br>Previously Laura hit headlines when she showed up at Extinction Rebellion marches topless and then set up an OnlyFans page to donate some of her funds to the campaign.<br><br>Two weeks ago the blonde mum announced that she was going on hunger strike to get a response from the Prime Minister after asking him to set more ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions.<br><br>Laura declared that she wouldn&#x27;t eat anything more until the government responds to the letter.<br><br>She made a name for herself by going topless at the Extinction Rebellion protests, claiming she was doing it to &quot;draw attention to the threat of climate change&quot;.<br><br>But her protests have come under fire from people online who claim she&#x27;s &quot;attention-seeking&quot;, &quot;wants to be an influencer&quot; and told her to put her clothes on.</p>
