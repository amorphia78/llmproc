        <h1>Toffs behaving badly: how the ‘Filthy Fulfords’ cleaned up</h1><h2>The foul-mouthed, forever broke 'Osbournes in tweeds' were a TV sensation – and showed the aristocracy as we'd never seen them before</h2>

    <p>Some viewers hailed it “hilarious”, “priceless” and “pure escapism”. Others took to Twitter to call it “out of touch”, ”tone deaf” and “everything that’s wrong with this country”. ITV’s stately docuseries Keeping Up With The Aristocrats launched last night to, let’s say, a mixed reception.<br><br>Following four of Britain’s most prominent dynasties - the Mountbattens, Romanoffs, Sitwells and Fitzalan-Howards - it was an awfully entertaining hour of crumbling residences, robust swearing and red trousers.<br><br>There’s a long and (literally) noble tradition of factual TV following asset-rich, cash-poor aristocrats. They might have blue blood and good breeding but they’re also frequently broke and prepared to play ball for camera crews. It’s pleasingly voyeuristic. It’s televisual class tourism. And crucially, it’s often very funny.<br><br>Hands up if you remember Home From The Hill, director Molly Dineen’s award-winning 1987 documentary about the larger-than-life army officer Hilary Hook? The brilliantly bittersweet film showed how retired Lieutenant-Colonel had been evicted from his extravagant colonial home in Kenya and was struggling to adjust to modern life back in Blighty. Cue him cursing at tin openers and reminiscing about jolly japes from his public schooldays (“Are soles in season, sir?”).<br><br>From the reclusive oddballs of Grey Gardens to the preening King’s Road socialites of Made In Chelsea, viewers have long held a fascination for seeing how the other half really live. The likes of Lord Brocket and Lady Colin Campbell found unlikely fame in the I’m A Celebrity jungle. We’ve since had Posh Pawn, Inside Tatler, and those endless schedule-fillers about decorating stately homes for Christmas. Yah, yah, absolutely. The upper classes have become a plummy primetime fixture.<br><br>TV’s current obsession with toff docs can surely be traced back to the “filthy Fulfords” - an eccentric clan of West Country aristos who became cult anti-heroes during the Noughties. Their outrageous antics caused a storm in a bone china teacup and saw them dubbed “The Osbournes in tweeds”.<br><br>Airing in August 2004 on Channel 4’s Cutting Edge strand, The F______ Fulfords followed Francis and Kishanda Fulford as they hatched hare-brained schemes to fund repairs to their dilapidated Tudor pile in rural Devon. Their bloodline could be traced back to Richard the Lionheart, who’d gifted Francis’ forebears their estate in 1199 for a “job well done” during the Crusades.<br><br>The fly-on-the-wall film exposed the family as rude, crude, uncouth and unhygienic. Their faces were ruddy, their teeth snaggly. Bat droppings pebble-dashed the soft furnishings. Their four unruly children had a penchant for fisticuffs, smashing china, slinging mud at each other and hurling cricket balls across the Great Hall. Muddy labradors Bertie and Tim jumped on the kitchen table to lick their owners’ dinner plates clean.<br><br>“The ways I train my dogs and bring up my children are exactly the same,” said Francis. His school nicknames, he explained matter-of-factly, had been “Full-of-food”, “Fatty” and simply “F___er”.<br><br>We heard how the 800-year-old, 3,000-acre Great Fulford estate cost £30,000 a year to run, while the creaking 48-room manor house needed repairs worth £1m. Wallpaper was peeling. Windows were broken. Roofs leaked, debts mounted and the family “lived in genteel poverty”.<br><br>Francis’ money-spinning ideas included borrowing a £99 metal detector in the hope of unearthing buried treasure (he found the princely sum of 6p), conjuring up a ghost to attract American tourists and searching the grounds for telephone cables so he could invoice BT for using his land. Long-suffering, Tanzania-born wife Kishanda preferred sneaking off for a secret flutter on the gee-gees. “Why aren’t we rich?” she asked. “It really annoys me.”<br><br>It was chaotic, compelling and bracingly entertaining. They drank like fish, smoked like chimneys and swore like sailors. When Francis claimed his first word as a baby had been “bugger”, it was unclear whether he was joking.</p>

    <p>Their loudly expressed views were refreshingly un-PC. Francis railed against the Germans and French, and sneered at Americans for having “a fat gene”. He expressed pride that his children weren’t “a bunch of poofs” because “you can’t breed from them”.<br><br>In a fit of rage, Kishanda threw the children’s TV into the lake. Francis ranted about “those bastards” and “w______” at English Heritage. During the 45-minute programme, he uttered 38 swearwords. Another 15 came from his children. This was car-crash TV, if the car was a clapped-out Jag stuck in a ditch.<br><br>It attracted 3.5m viewers and earned a Bafta nomination. For a generation of viewers, it was their first introduction to just how dishevelled and down-on-their-luck posh people can be. When once they ruled over us, 21st century landed gentry are often custodians of draughty, decaying ruins are ruinously costly to maintain. They must diversify to pay their way but are often ill-equipped to do so.<br><br>The much-discussed documentary brought the Fulfords a strange kind of fame. Patriarch Francis popped up on other programmes including How Clean Is Your House, Country House Rescue, Salvage Hunters, Help! My House Is Haunted and the poetically titled Why Britain’s F_____. It all made him a little less skint, at least.<br><br>He tried to enter local politics, standing for a seat on Teignbridge District Council as a Conservative candidate but polled just 370 votes, despite the area being a Tory stronghold. Fulford promptly joined UKIP instead.<br><br>With the appetite for aristocratic TV reawakened by Downton Abbey, the Fulfords returned to our screens in 2014. The BBC Three series Life Is Toff focused on the next generation. A decade after they’d been terrors in short trousers, the six-parter followed siblings Arthur, Humphrey, Edmund and Matilda - now aged 17 to 21 - as they prepared to leave education and enter the real world.<br><br>Well, sort of. As heir-to-the-estate Arthur said: “‘We’ve been here longer than the f______ monarchy. If anyone tries to judge me for being in this amazing position, frankly they can f___ off.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, he’d been expelled from £30,000-a-year Sherborne school for bad behaviour.<br><br>Great Fulford now relied on guided tours, wedding bookings, pheasant shoots and photoshoots for income. The Fulford Jnrs flogged antiques at a car boot sale but were so rubbish at it, they only made a few quid. Matilda got so stressed by the experience, she called an ambulance.<br><br>They fired air rifles from windows and hit golf balls at grazing cows. Matilda roller-skated around the Great Hall, like Princess Diana in The Crown. A large Muscovy duck called Ben roamed the corridors, leaving a trail of droppings behind him.<br><br>In 2016, Arthur was charged with drink-driving and resisting arrest after flipping his father&#x27;s Ford Focus on a country lane. The 24-year-old insisted he wasn’t over the limit after sinking five pints at a local pub. He lost his appeal and was slapped with a 12-month ban. Even his own lawyer said Arthur’s evidence was &quot;all over the place&quot; and &quot;a bit of a pantomime&quot;.<br><br>The following year, he tried to extend his 15 minutes of fame by signing up for reality franchise Big Brother. Arthur entered the house hoping to “have a really good time” but duly got into rows about the benefits system and whether the earth is flat. He vandalised a mannequin while drunk on champagne, took a naked shower in front of his housemates, then quit after six days, branding them “f_____g stupid”. Talk about a chip off the old block.<br><br>His father Francis, now 69, remains as opinionated as ever. The latest entries on his blog defend Prince Andrew, call civil servant Sir Philip Rutnam “a big girl’s blouse” for accusing Priti Patel of bullying, and slam Londoners as “wet” for “putting up with the ridiculous Extinction Rebellion protesters” when they should “sort these prima donna idiots out”.<br><br>Ah, Francis Fulford. Don’t go f_____g changing.</p>
