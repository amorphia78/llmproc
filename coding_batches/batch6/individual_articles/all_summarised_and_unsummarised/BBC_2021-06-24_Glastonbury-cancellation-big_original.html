    <p>Two years without the Glastonbury Festival has meant &quot;a big financial hit&quot; for environmental charity Greenpeace.<br><br>Glastonbury usually takes place on the last weekend of June but was cancelled in 2021 and 2020, due to Covid-19.<br><br>Founder Michael Eavis is one of its biggest donors, often giving up to £500,000 after each festival.<br><br>Greenpeace&#x27;s Bob Wilson said it had also missed having a key opportunity to &quot;sign up new supporters&quot;.<br><br>Hundreds of thousands of people would have descended on the Somerset farm if the festival had gone ahead this weekend.<br><br>Mr Wilson, who is the charity&#x27;s events manager, said: &quot;That single donation makes up quite a big chunk of our annual income, so only having one Glastonbury festival in the last four years has been a big financial hit for us.&quot;<br><br>The organisation has been a staple part of the festival, which usually takes place in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, since 1991.<br><br>Mr Eavis wrote to Lord Peter Melchett, the then CEO of Greenpeace 30 years ago, inviting the charity and its supporters to his festival.<br><br>Over time their role changed, eventually leading to a Greenpeace field dedicated to environmental education and awareness.<br><br>Mr Wilson said: &quot;We were quite pleased to join as it gave us access to a very large crowd even then, like-minded people and right from the word go Michael gave Greenpeace a donation.<br><br>&quot;We went from selling badges and t-shirts and things like that in a little tent to eventually Michael saying &#x27;would you like to run a field?&#x27; It just grew from there really. It&#x27;s become quite a destination field now.&quot;<br><br>The largest music festival in the UK, Glastonbury offers charities the opportunity to spread the message about their work to up to 200,000 people in one weekend.<br><br>Mr Wilson said one particular year &quot;we got 80,000 people signed up across the site, which is no mean feat&quot;.<br><br>He said that in other years &quot;we gave lunch to the Dalai Lama&quot;.<br><br>&quot;We gave lunch to [former Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn as he wrote his speech in the corner. It all adds to the very important brand awareness and the fact that the donations are important.&quot;</p>

    <p>Glastonbury has a &quot;fallow&quot; year every five years, but Mr Wilson said with these extra two events called off, organisers &quot;immediately started to think about us&quot;.<br><br>The festival team has raised money for Greenpeace, WaterAid and Oxfam by collaborating on a line of merchandise following 2020&#x27;s cancellation and through its Live at Worthy Farm online event in May, with plans to donate from its upcoming camping season at the site.<br><br>WaterAid and Oxfam are also prominent charities at the festival who benefit from donations and sign-ups.<br><br>WaterAid&#x27;s Anna Hedges said it had been a festival partner for 26 years: &quot;During which time we have received more than £2.5m in generous donations to help transform lives with clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene.&quot;<br><br>She thanked Michael and Emily Eavis and the team &quot;for their ongoing commitment and support&quot;.<br><br>Mr Wilson said he was grateful for the extra help from the team during the pandemic.<br><br>&quot;So they&#x27;ve tried to keep it ticking over, but the loss is there for everyone to realise,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;We miss the community, I guess, more than anything; everybody coming together from all over the world to work with us and to meet us.<br><br>&quot;We can&#x27;t wait for another proper, &#x27;normal&#x27; Glastonbury, both for the financial boost it gives us, and because it&#x27;s the best party in the world.&quot;<br><br>The Glastonbury site is to be transformed into a &quot;family-friendly campsite&quot; over the school holidays.<br><br>In January Emily and Michael Eavis confirmed the 2021 cancellation and that anyone with a ticket would be offered the opportunity to roll their £50 deposit over to next year, when the festival will hopefully resume.<br><br>Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
