    <p>Activists and politicians have cautiously welcomed an unexpected US-China declaration that vowed to boost climate co-operation. The EU and UN described the move as encouraging and an important step, but Greenpeace said both countries needed to take concrete action.<br><br>The US and China, the world&#x27;s two biggest CO2 emitters, said they would work together to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Scientists say that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C will help humanity avoid the worst climate impacts.<br><br>The announcement was made at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. According to China&#x27;s climate envoy, the declaration was agreed following some 30 meetings with the US over the past 10 months. It pledges close co-operation on cutting emissions, while a joint working group will &quot;meet regularly to address the climate crisis&quot; over the next decade.<br><br>Experts and activists have warned that policies must now be enacted to support the promises. Genevieve Maricle from WWF said the announcement offered &quot;new hope&quot; but added that &quot;we must also be clear eyed about what is still required if the two countries are to deliver the emission reductions necessary in the next nine years&quot;.</p>

    <p><br><br>The US-China declaration calls for increased efforts to close the &quot;significant gap&quot; that remains to achieve the 1.5C target. There were steps agreed on issues including methane emissions, the transition to clean energy and de-carbonisation.<br><br>China&#x27;s top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua stated that on climate change &quot;there is more agreement between China and US than divergence&quot;. US climate envoy John Kerry emphasized that while US and China had many differences, co-operation on climate was vital.<br><br>China aims for carbon neutrality by 2060, with a plan to hit peak emissions before 2030, while the US is aiming for net-zero by 2050.</p>
