The road has now reopened.<br><br>A High Court injunction banning protests around the M25 and Dartford Crossing was issued last Thursday.<br><br>&quot;You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere,&quot; the campaign group said.<br><br>It is the latest of several protests targeting major roads in the south east.<br><br>The order, which was granted to National Highways Ltd, states demonstrators are banned from &quot;causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto&quot;.<br><br>It adds that those involved &quot;may be held to be in contempt of court and may be imprisoned, fined or have their assets seized.&quot;<br><br>The injunction includes slip roads and bridges.<br><br>Ministers had hoped the High Court injunction would prevent further disruption around London.<br><br>In statements read out last week at the Home Office, the campaigners said: &quot;We are more scared of the destruction of our country than we are of breaking an injunction.</p>
