She was arrested but later allowed to return home, Dutch news agency ANP said.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion accused police of using water cannon just 15 minutes after the start of the blockade - but police said they had asked the activists to leave and gave them a chance to do so before using the water cannon.</p>

    <p>The 1,579 people who refused to leave were then arrested.<br><br>Many of those people were lifted up and carried onto buses, local news site De Telegraaf reported.<br><br>The Dutch prosecution service said most of them will not be prosecuted because it was a &quot;minor offence&quot; and the main purpose of the arrests was to end the blockade.<br><br>Forty people will still be prosecuted, police said, after being arrested for other criminal offences such as vandalism and resisting arrest resulting in injury.<br><br>The arrests happened in the space of just a few hours and the road was cleared by early evening on Saturday.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion said at least 6,000 people demonstrated on the A12 or next to it - including the &quot;A12 orchestra&quot; of more than 80 musicians.<br><br>It is the seventh time Extinction Rebellion protesters have blocked the A12. Protesting on this road is banned under rules brought in by the mayor.</p>
