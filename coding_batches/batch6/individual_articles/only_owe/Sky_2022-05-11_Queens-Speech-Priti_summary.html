        <h1>Queen's Speech: Priti Patel accuses Labour MPs of defending 'murderers, paedophiles, rapists, thugs' in debate on law and order</h1><h2>Priti Patel also claimed that immigration lawyers and Labour members have previously begged her not to deport "dangerous foreign criminals".</h2><p>Priti Patel has accused Labour MPs of being &quot;eager to defend the murderers, paedophiles, rapists, thugs and those with no right to be here&quot; during a debate on the Queen&#x27;s Speech in the Commons. The home secretary declared that &quot;the Conservative Party is the party of law and order&quot; and said the new Public Order Bill will allow police officers to &quot;prevent severe disruption&quot;.<br><br>One of the 38 bills announced in the Queen&#x27;s Speech, the Public Order Bill &quot;backs the police to prevent antisocial protests from disrupting people&#x27;s lives&quot;. It particularly targets protest groups including Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain which have used disruptive methods to draw attention to the climate crisis. Under the new bill, people who aim to lock themselves or others to buildings, roads or printing presses will be committing an offence.<br><br>Ms Patel said the bill will be used to combat &quot;guerrilla tactics&quot; used by protesters. She described the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act as a &quot;major step forward&quot;, but said some parts of it had been &quot;frustrated by the unelected&quot; House of Lords and opposition MPs.</p>

    <p><br><br>The home secretary added: &quot;We will not be deterred from our duty to protect the law-abiding majority from mob rule and the thuggery that we have seen, and the Public Order Bill combats the guerrilla tactics that bring such misery to the hardworking public, that disrupts business, interferes with emergency services, costs taxpayers millions and puts lives at risk.&quot;<br><br>Conservative MP Lee Anderson suggested that environmental protesters should be put to work &quot;seven days a week&quot; as punishment for disruptive tactics. However, the bill is not without criticism, with Green MP Caroline Lucas vowing to work with other parties to defeat the legislation.</p></body></html>
