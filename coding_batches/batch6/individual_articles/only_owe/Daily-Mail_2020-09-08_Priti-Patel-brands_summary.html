    <p>Home Secretary Priti Patel has launched a scathing attack on Extinction Rebellion (XR) protesters, labeling them as &#x27;so-called eco-crusaders turned criminals&#x27; in a speech to the Police Superintendents&#x27; Association annual conference. Patel&#x27;s strong words come in response to XR&#x27;s recent printing press blockade, which left some newsagents&#x27; shelves empty on Saturday morning.<br><br>Addressing the conference, held digitally due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Patel vowed to crack down on the group&#x27;s &#x27;guerrilla tactics&#x27; and not allow them to cause &#x27;anarchy&#x27; on the streets. She stated, &quot;I refuse point blank to allow that kind of anarchy on our streets. And I&#x27;m right behind you as you bring the full might of the law down upon that selfish minority.&quot;<br><br>Patel described XR&#x27;s actions as a &quot;shameful attack on our way of life, our economy, and the livelihoods of the hardworking majority.&quot; She emphasized that these are not peaceful tactics, but rather &quot;tactics that are deployed to cause maximum damage to society.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The Home Secretary highlighted the disruption caused by the group, including the blocking of roads which prevented ambulances and emergency vehicles from reaching hospitals. She argued that such actions threaten people&#x27;s lives and the economic wellbeing of society, especially at a time when the country is trying to recover from the pandemic.<br><br>In response to these disruptive protests, the Government has said that powers to help police deal with such actions are &#x27;under constant review.&#x27; Home Office minister Kit Malthouse accused some XR activists of seeking to &#x27;impose an extremist world view&#x27; on others, stating that their tactics undermine the &#x27;worthy cause&#x27; of environmental campaigning.</p></body></html>
