    <p>This week, climate activists from Just Stop Oil made headlines by disrupting the World Snooker Championship, covering the table in orange powder. This disruptive action is part of a series of provocative protests that have stirred strong opinions on all sides.<br><br>Recent polls show that while many people view climate change as a major threat, support for climate policies doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate to support for disruptive protests. A YouGov poll found that six in 10 Brits think defacing art or public monuments should be made a specific criminal offence.<br><br>However, some researchers argue that radical tactics deployed by small numbers of climate activists may be beneficial for wider progress, even if they are widely disliked by the public. Dana Fisher, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, explains that these actions aim to pull the conversation towards more extreme solutions and tactics.</p>

    <p><br><br>Interestingly, studies suggest that dislike of protesters or their tactics doesn&#x27;t appear to result in less support for climate action. Fisher notes that disruptive protests tend to generate more support for the issue, even if people don&#x27;t like the organizations or tactics themselves.<br><br>However, the impact of protests on public opinion is mixed. Some studies have found that &quot;extreme protest actions&quot; can reduce support for a social movement&#x27;s central cause, a situation often referred to as &quot;the activist&#x27;s dilemma.&quot;<br><br>Climate activists seeking to effect change may need to carefully balance getting attention for their issue without alienating potential supporters. The long-term impacts of such protests on both public opinion and policy remain an area of ongoing research and debate.</p>
