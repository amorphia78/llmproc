    <p>Chris Packham, the popular presenter of BBC&#x27;s Springwatch and a prominent supporter of Extinction Rebellion (XR), has responded to allegations of hypocrisy raised by Lord Botham. The former England cricket captain turned charity campaigner highlighted Packham&#x27;s support for both XR and long-distance air travel.<br><br>Packham has become XR&#x27;s biggest celebrity cheerleader and is a regular at its protests. In an interview last year, he proclaimed XR &quot;the first real hope of making a bigger difference&quot;. However, it has emerged that Packham appears to have been an avid supporter of long distance aviation, promoting exotic and adventurous holidays to all corners of the planet.<br><br>Lord Botham, concerned that environmental policies could push millions of people into &quot;green poverty&quot;, wrote in The Telegraph: &quot;Chris promotes holidays for the rich that encourage people to go on very long flights to places like Botswana, Peru and the Falkland Islands. Flights which create eye-watering emissions.&quot; He added: &quot;Packham is guilty of grotesque eco-hypocrisy&quot;.</p>

    <p><br><br>In response, Packham said Lord Botham&#x27;s criticism was part of a longstanding grudge over the divisive issue of game shooting. Packham told The Telegraph he had participated in a number of adventure or eco-tourism holidays over the years but resolved not to undertake any more in the future.<br><br>XR has regularly carried out direct action protests at airports, disrupting holiday travel plans for thousands of families, as well as business passengers. One of XR&#x27;s founders Roger Hallam has branded flying a &#x27;no no&#x27;, and compared it to eating meat.<br><br>Packham said he had &quot;not seen an airport, like everyone else&quot; for the past 18 months. He also said he did not fully support XR, stating, &quot;I like aspects of XR but bear in mind it is a decentralised unit, there are things they do which I don&#x27;t support. They are not a one size fits all outfit.&quot;</p>
