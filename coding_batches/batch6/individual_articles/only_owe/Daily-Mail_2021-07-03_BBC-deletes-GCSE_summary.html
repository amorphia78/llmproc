    <p>The BBC has removed a list of &#x27;positive impacts&#x27; of climate change from its Bitesize revision guide for GCSE geography students following intense backlash from environmental activists. The guide initially included controversial &#x27;benefits&#x27; such as the creation of new shipping routes due to melting ice and lower heating bills due to warmer winters.<br><br>Campaigners, including Guardian journalist George Monbiot, branded the BBC Bitesize material an &#x27;absolute disgrace&#x27;. Monbiot argued that the web page read like &#x27;fossil fuel propaganda&#x27; and would leave schoolchildren thinking global warming was &#x27;pretty good&#x27;.<br><br>The list of &#x27;benefits&#x27; also included claims that warmer temperatures lead to &#x27;healthier outdoor lifestyles&#x27;, &#x27;new tourist destinations&#x27;, &#x27;oil becoming available in Alaska and Siberia&#x27; as the ice melts, and some animals and plants may &#x27;flourish&#x27;.<br><br>The broadcaster faced furious backlash from climate experts, campaigners, and teachers who said the arguments were &#x27;flat wrong&#x27; and did not reflect the current syllabus. Stuart Lock, the chief executive of a group of schools in Bedfordshire, tweeted: &quot;I think this is flat wrong, doesn&#x27;t align with the national curriculum or exam specs, and needs reconsidering. Climate change isn&#x27;t a &#x27;both sides&#x27; argument.&quot;</p>

The guide now shows only the negative impacts of global warming, such as rising sea levels, droughts, and greater risk of flooding.</p>
