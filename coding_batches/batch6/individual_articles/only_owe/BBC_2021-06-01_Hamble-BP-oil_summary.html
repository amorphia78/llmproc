    <p>Environmental activists from Extinction Rebellion have blocked the entrance to an oil terminal in Hampshire. Members of the campaign group laid across the entrance to a BP depot in Hamble, near Southampton, to protest against &quot;greenwashing&quot; by the fossil fuel industry and government.<br><br>Some of the protesters locked arms inside oil barrels, while others dressed as cleaning ladies armed with scrubbing brushes. The demonstration has blocked road tanker traffic in and out of the Hamble terminal, which supplies fuel to service stations across the south of England.<br><br>Officers from Hampshire Constabulary have spoken to the campaigners but are currently allowing the protest to continue.<br><br>James Hill, from Extinction Rebellion, said: &quot;The government continues to announce paper targets to reduce emissions but it is still business as usual for fossil fuel companies. This is incompatible with the urgent need for a rapid transition away from fossil fuels to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Mr Hill called &quot;on the government to stop the greenwash&quot; and &quot;end the subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and accelerate the transition to renewables&quot;.<br><br>A BP spokesperson said the company aimed to become a net zero company by &quot;2050 or sooner&quot;. They added: &quot;To achieve this, our strategy will see us increase our spending on renewable energy ten-fold over this decade, to around $5 billion a year, and also reduce our oil and gas production by 40%.&quot;<br><br>A government spokesperson said: &quot;We are working hard to drive down demand for fossil fuels, but as the independent Climate Change Committee recognises, there will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas.&quot;</p>
