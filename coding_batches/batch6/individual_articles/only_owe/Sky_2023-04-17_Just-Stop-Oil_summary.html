    <p>Two Just Stop Oil protesters have forced a stoppage in play at the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield. The duo invaded the arena shortly after play began early in the evening session, with a man interrupting the match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry by jumping on the table where he released a packet of orange dye.<br><br>A female protester was stopped from attacking the match between Mark Allen and Fan Zhengyi on table two by the quick-thinking response of referee Olivier Marteel. Play was immediately suspended as staff brought vacuum cleaners into the arena. Master of ceremonies Rob Walker was among those helping to sweep up the mess.<br><br>A 52-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, South Yorkshire Police said. Both are in custody.<br><br>The match between Allen and Zhengyi eventually resumed on table two, which was not covered in dye. A decision over whether or not to resume the other match will be taken after that match is completed, the World Snooker Tour said. The damaged table will be reclothed overnight.</p>

    <p><br><br>Former world champion Stephen Hendry, on commentary duties for the BBC, said: &quot;I have never seen that before at a snooker event. It&#x27;s a first. It is scary. Wow! You just hope the cloth can be recovered from that. It caught us all by surprise and then this happens.&quot;<br><br>The protest group&#x27;s official Twitter page posted a video of the incident, stating that the protesters are demanding that the government immediately stop all new UK fossil fuel projects. They are also calling on UK sporting institutions to step into civil resistance against the government&#x27;s policies, which they describe as &quot;genocidal.&quot;</p>
