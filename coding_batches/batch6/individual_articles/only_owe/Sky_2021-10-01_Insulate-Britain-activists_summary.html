    <p>At least 30 people have been arrested as the climate group Insulate Britain blocked three motorway junctions, causing long queues of traffic for the 10th day in the past three weeks.<br><br>The Metropolitan Police said 39 people have been arrested after protesters sat on the road at roundabouts for junction 3 of the M4 near Heathrow and junction 1 of the M1 at Brent cross on Friday. Other members of the group also blocked a roundabout at junction 25 of the M25 at Waltham Cross on the boundary between north London and Hertfordshire at around 10.30am.<br><br>Some activists glued their hands to the road and others chained themselves together. The action caused long queues, prompting drivers to beep their horns in frustration, with one grabbing a banner from an activist&#x27;s hands.<br><br>Police said protesters blocked the M4 at around 8.27am. Officers were on the scene in 13 minutes and the road was cleared by 9am, with 13 people arrested for obstruction and conspiracy to commit public nuisance. The M1 was cleared by 10am with 17 people detained for the same offences.</p>

    <p><br><br>Insulate Britain wants the government to insulate and retrofit homes across the UK to cut climate emissions. It has pledged to continue its actions until the government makes &quot;a meaningful statement indicating that they will insulate all of Britain&#x27;s 29 million leaky homes by 2030&quot;.<br><br>The government obtained an injunction last week which means anyone blocking the M25 could be found to be in contempt of court, carrying a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine. Insulate Britain admitted that its actions this week &quot;are in breach&quot; of the injunction.<br><br>Hugh Bladon, founding member of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: &quot;What we need now is firm action from the police before someone gets killed. They&#x27;ve made their point, now go away and get this country working properly.&quot;</p>
