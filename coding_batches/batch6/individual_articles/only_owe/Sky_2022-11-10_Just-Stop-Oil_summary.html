        <h1>Just Stop Oil protester defends M25 disruption: 'Birds are falling out of the sky, pensioners are dying'</h1><h2>Campaigner Indigo Rumbelow, in a tense exchange with Sky News' Mark Austin, argues that protests causing widespread disruption should and will continue until the government issues a statement to stop new licences for oil and gas.</h2><p>A Just Stop Oil campaigner has defended protests blocking the M25 for a fourth day, warning that &quot;this is just the beginning&quot;. In a fiery exchange with Sky News&#x27; Mark Austin, Indigo Rumbelow insisted the climate crisis is set to get &quot;worse and worse and worse unless we act.&quot;<br><br>Ms Rumbelow described the situation as &quot;incredibly grave&quot; and said Just Stop Oil has one simple demand - for the government to stop licencing new gas and oil in the UK. &quot;We need everybody to come and join us so that we don&#x27;t have to cause this type of disruption on the motorways,&quot; she said.<br><br>The campaigner was interviewed as police forces scramble to deal with demonstrations which have caused severe delays on Britain&#x27;s busiest motorway. The actions of protesters have been branded &quot;criminal, reckless and dangerous&quot; by Essex Police Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who warned it is &quot;only a matter of time&quot; before someone gets killed.</p><p><br><br>When asked about whether Just Stop Oil&#x27;s message is getting &quot;lost&quot; in angry debate about their methods, Ms Rumbelow said: &quot;The climate crisis is disrupting people around the world right now and even here in the UK this summer we saw the effects of the climate crisis. With the UK getting 40C heat and birds falling out of the sky and pensioners dying before they should.&quot;<br><br>She added, &quot;This isn&#x27;t an issue of just green policy or just the climate protesters, it&#x27;s an issue that&#x27;s going to impact you, it&#x27;s going to impact me, it&#x27;s going to impact your children if you have children, and it&#x27;s impacting people around the world, so our government&#x27;s decision to go ahead with new oil and gas with the full knowledge that this will kill millions of people is a complete act of betrayal on my generation.&quot;</p></body></html>
