    <p>The Metropolitan Police has urged the public not to &quot;directly intervene&quot; with Just Stop Oil demonstrators, instead advising people to &quot;call us, and we will deal&quot; with the climate change group. This comes after angry motorists removed protesters from blocked roads in central London on Saturday.<br><br>Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist explained that while he &quot;completely understood their frustration,&quot; taking matters into their own hands could hamper prosecutions. The police must work within a legal framework to secure evidence for the offence of highway obstruction, which includes proving the obstruction is deliberate, unlawful, and unreasonable in the context of protest.<br><br>On Saturday, Just Stop Oil campaigners sat in Charing Cross Road, Kensington High Street, Harleyford Street and Blackfriars Road, demanding the government halts new oil licences. This prompted some drivers to leave their vehicles in Harleyford Street to remove demonstrators, who persistently returned to retake their places in the road.</p>

    <p><br><br>One frustrated motorist said: &quot;We&#x27;ve asked you nicely, you are doing the wrong thing by blocking innocent people going about their business. Can you please move before we pick you up and move you?&quot;<br><br>The police later reported that 33 protesters were arrested and the roads were reopened. The group wants the government to halt all new oil and gas licences and consents.<br><br>Mr Twist stated that the Met is &quot;absolutely committed to providing a quick and effective response to activists who have been significantly and deliberately disrupting people&#x27;s daily lives.&quot; He revealed that the force had arrested 651 people since the beginning of October in relation to these protests.</p>
