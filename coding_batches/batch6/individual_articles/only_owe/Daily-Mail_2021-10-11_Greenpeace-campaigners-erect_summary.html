    <p>Greenpeace campaigners have erected a 12ft oil-spattered statue of Boris Johnson at Downing Street in protest at a new oilfield. The demonstrators led a protest of around 40 people, with 16 locked onto barrels and the mock statue of the Prime Minister while others held banners reading &quot;Boris: Stop Cambo&quot;.<br><br>The group called for the Government to end the UK&#x27;s reliance on oil and to urge Mr Johnson not to sign off on a new drilling permit at Cambo oilfield, west of Shetland. There had been at least three arrests during the protest, with more expected as protesters continue to be cut out of their chains by police.<br><br>The 90kg statue, created by artist Hugo Farmer, is accompanied by a sign that reads: &quot;Cambo oilfield: Boris Johnson&#x27;s monumental climate failure&quot;, and Mr Johnson&#x27;s hands are completely covered in black oil. A plaque on the statue reads: &#x27;Cambo oilfield: Boris Johnson&#x27;s monumental climate failure&#x27;.</p>

    <p><br><br>Greenpeace says it is protesting against the pending approval of the new oilfield in Cambo, off the coast of the Shetland Islands. The Government looks set to go ahead with the plans, which if approved, according to campaign group Stop Cambo, the site would produce 170 million barrels of oil and generate emissions equivalent to the annual carbon pollution from 18 coal-fired power stations.<br><br>Philip Evans, oil campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: &#x27;People across the UK are feeling the stresses of a gas price crisis as well as a climate crisis, and the government acknowledges that our reliance on fossil fuels has left the UK vulnerable and exposed. People are right to feel angry and upset.&#x27;<br><br>The protest comes just weeks before the UK hosts a global climate change conference in Scotland.</p>
