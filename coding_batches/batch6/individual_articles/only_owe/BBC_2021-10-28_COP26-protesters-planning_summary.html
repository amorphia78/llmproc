    <p>Climate change protesters from Extinction Rebellion are planning high-impact &quot;deliberate disruption&quot; during the upcoming COP26 summit in Glasgow. The group, known for its &quot;non-violent direct action,&quot; aims to call on world leaders to take urgent action on the climate emergency.<br><br>Catherine Idle, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, stated, &quot;Our approach is to have deliberate disruption where it&#x27;s going to make the most impact.&quot; She emphasized that their goal is to get the attention of people in positions of power, not to inconvenience the general public. The activists say they are prepared to be arrested but will try not to block routes used by emergency vehicles.<br><br>The protesters&#x27; primary target appears to be the COP26 conference itself and the world leaders attending it. Idle explained, &quot;There have been 25 COPs already and emissions are still rising and so we&#x27;re there to demand they do better.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>While the exact number of protesters is not specified, the article mentions that as many as 100,000 people are expected to attend a march and rally organized by the COP26 Coalition on November 6th.<br><br>Police Scotland is preparing for potential disruptions, with 10,000 officers on duty every day during the conference. The force states it will facilitate peaceful protests but won&#x27;t tolerate anything that disrupts the conference or the wider community. Extra cell capacity has been arranged, and courts in several Scottish cities are preparing to deal with additional cases.<br><br>The article maintains a neutral tone towards the protests, presenting both the protesters&#x27; intentions and the authorities&#x27; preparations without taking a stance on either side.</p>
