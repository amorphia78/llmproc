    <p>A group of Just Stop Oil activists disrupted Sunday&#x27;s British Grand Prix at Silverstone by breaking onto the track and sitting on the circuit. The dangerous stunt occurred shortly after the race had been red-flagged due to a crash, meaning no cars were running at the time. Marshals and security swiftly removed the small group of protestors.<br><br>The incident has sparked debate, with former England footballer Gary Lineker expressing support for the protestors on Twitter, stating: &quot;If it&#x27;s not already too late, history will look back very favourably on these people.&quot; However, former Formula 1 driver and Sky Sports pundit Martin Brundle strongly disagreed, responding: &quot;Gary please don&#x27;t encourage this reckless behaviour. They&#x27;d have been sliced into 100 pieces and fans, marshals and drivers were wholly at risk of injury and death.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Lineker, who has long spoken out on environmental issues, defended his stance, arguing that climate change poses a greater risk of death than delaying a motor race. The protest action has received widespread condemnation, although there has been some praise for the overall campaign.<br><br>Some of the racing drivers, including Sir Lewis Hamilton and race winner Carlos Sainz Jr., have also shared their opinions on the protesters. The incident has sparked ongoing discussions about the balance between environmental activism and public safety at sporting events.</p></body></html>
