    <p>Environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion (XR) has apologised in advance to the people of Falmouth for any disruption caused by its G7 protests. The town is hosting the International Media Centre at the National Maritime Museum during the G7 Summit 2021, which runs from 1-13 June 2021.<br><br>In an open letter to residents, XR said: &quot;We know that the G7 Summit will cause disruption and it is likely that our presence will add to this. We have done our best to plan our actions to be peaceful, creative, artistic and Covid safe. We have also planned to minimise disruption, but believe that some is inevitable. We sincerely apologise in advance for any additional disruption that we cause.&quot;<br><br>The group stated its intention to get the attention of world leaders and the press, emphasizing the urgency of climate action. &quot;The stakes could be no higher. In Cornwall, how long before we see a storm powerful enough to rip the roofs from our houses?&quot; the letter reads.</p>

    <p><br><br>The main Falmouth protest, called &quot;G is for Greenwash,&quot; will take place on Saturday 12 June. It will involve a &#x27;creative&#x27; march through the town alongside theatrical and musical performances. The title refers to the way XR claims organisations and Governments pay lip service to climate change but do not take action.<br><br>Nat Squire, 24, an osteopath and XR member from Falmouth said: &quot;Our government claims to be a climate leader while every decision they make takes us closer to climate and ecological collapse. This is worse than greenwash, it&#x27;s a massive fraud and people my age will end up paying the price.&quot;<br><br>Extinction Rebellion plans to hold its main G7 protests on Friday 11 June in St Ives, Saturday 12 June in Falmouth and then back in St Ives on Sunday 13 June.</p>
