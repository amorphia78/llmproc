        <h1>Roc Sandford fears for his children Blue and Lazer in HS2 tunnel protest</h1><p>An island laird has expressed grave concerns for the lives of his son and daughter, who are part of a protest camp tunnel 500 miles away. Roc Sandford, an environmental activist, criticized health and safety chiefs from his home on the Hebridean island of Gometra.<br><br>Blue, 18, and Lazer, 20, are among a small band of eco-warriors in a 100ft-long tunnel secretly constructed under Euston Square Gardens in London. The protesters are demonstrating against HS2&#x27;s high-speed rail development plan and have been in the tunnel since Wednesday.<br><br>Safety fears are growing as the tunnel has witnessed five soil collapses while eviction teams work to gain access. Sandford has lodged a complaint with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) for failing to halt eviction tactics he claims have put the lives of the protesters at risk.</p>

    <p><br><br>Sandford said, &quot;It is clear that a dangerous situation is rapidly evolving which is within HSE&#x27;s statutory obligations to address with utmost urgency. This is an emergency. HSE&#x27;s current response is totally inadequate.&quot;<br><br>The father alleges that the eviction team has denied activists the right to monitor oxygen levels in the depths of the tunnel and allowed water to flood in. He added, &quot;My son Lazer was injured by a tree root dropped on him from nine feet up. This is putting lives at risk.&quot;<br><br>A spokeswoman for HS2 said: &quot;We have had police and paramedics on the site and have had the London fire brigade there to assess the operation, and safety of all . . . remains at the forefront of everything we are doing.&quot;<br><br>The protesters are considering legal action against HSE as the tense situation continues to unfold.</p></body></html>
