    <p>Police have arrested 11 Insulate Britain protesters after they defied a government injunction by blocking the M25 for the seventh time. The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, glued their hands to the road surface at Junction 3 in Swanley, Kent at 7.30am on Wednesday, Kent Police said.<br><br>Just before 9am, the force announced they had arrested all 11 activists involved, bringing the total number of Insulate Britain arrests to 438. The Swanley Interchange roundabout at J3 of the M25 was reopened following the protest, with delays remaining in the area as the backlog of traffic cleared.<br><br>The government was granted an injunction by the High Court last week banning anyone from blocking the M25 following the group&#x27;s initial protests. Anyone who breaks an injunction can be found in contempt of court and could face two years in prison and an unlimited fine.</p>

    <p><br><br>Kent Police Superintendent Andy Gadd stated that the force is working with prosecutors to seek &quot;the most appropriate outcome&quot; following Insulate Britain protests in the county. He added that they are liaising closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to determine if any charges can be made.<br><br>Insulate Britain, which wants the government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to reduce carbon emissions, appeared defiant on Wednesday. In a tweet, they stated, &quot;We are going nowhere. You can raid our savings. You can confiscate our property. You can deny us our liberty and put us behind bars. But shooting the messenger can never destroy the message: that this country is going to hell unless you take emergency action to stop putting carbon into the air.&quot;</p>
