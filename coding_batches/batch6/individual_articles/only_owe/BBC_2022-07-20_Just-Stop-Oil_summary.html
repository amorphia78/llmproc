    <p>Protesters climbed signs above the M25, forcing police to shut sections of the motorway and to close lanes. Five Just Stop Oil campaigners scaled three gantries, including at Heathrow and the Dartford Crossing, where sections of the motorway were closed. They also targeted a sign near Cobham, Surrey.<br><br>Just Stop Oil said it was declaring the M25 &quot;a site of civil resistance&quot; and warned it would carry out further protests on the motorway in the coming days. Five people have been arrested in connection with the protests.<br><br>The protests at the Poyle interchange between junctions 14 (Heathrow) and 15 (M4), and in Dartford between the Queen Elizabeth Bridge northbound and junction 30 (Thurrock), saw local police shutting two clockwise sections and putting diversions in place. National Highways reported five miles of queuing traffic on the approach to junction 30 in Essex.</p>

    <p><br><br>Just Stop Oil&#x27;s statement said it chose the M25 as it was &quot;the place where we confront the carbon economy headlong and bring our resistance into full public view&quot;. The group is demanding the government make a &quot;meaningful statement&quot; to commit to stop licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK.<br><br>A government spokesman responded, saying: &quot;We will not bend to the will of activists who naively want to extinguish North Sea oil and gas production. Doing so would put energy security and British jobs at risk, and simply increases foreign imports, whilst not reducing demand.&quot;<br><br>The disruption caused significant delays, with one bus driver reporting that his pupils with special needs were about 90 minutes late for their last day of term due to the protests.</p>
