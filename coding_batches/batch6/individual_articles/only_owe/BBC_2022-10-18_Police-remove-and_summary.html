    <p>Police have arrested two men after removing them from the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge where they staged a two-day protest disrupting traffic on the M25. Just Stop Oil supporters scaled the bridge&#x27;s masts at the Dartford Crossing in the early hours of Monday. The activists said the action was in protest against new government oil and gas licences.<br><br>Essex Police brought a raised platform to the scene to &quot;allow specially trained officers to work at great height&quot;. National Highways reported delays of up to 60 minutes for southbound traffic approaching the crossing on the M25, which was diverted through the Dartford Tunnel.<br><br>The climate change protesters were about 430ft (130m) above the water and 180ft (55m) above the road surface. Ch Supt Anslow told BBC Essex that officers tried to negotiate with the protesters on Monday using loudhailers, but that &quot;communication was very difficult because of the wind and the distance&quot;.<br><br>One of the protesters, Morgan Trowland, a 39-year-old bridge design engineer from London, said on Twitter on Tuesday morning that he was cold but had &quot;survived the night&quot;. He stated, &quot;We demand that the government stops all new licensing and consent for oil and gas extractions. We&#x27;re not going to get out of this emergency unless we take acts of civil resistance.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The protest caused significant disruption, with some people reporting being late for important events and work. Several Isthmian League football fixtures were also postponed due to travel issues.<br><br>In response, the government said: &quot;While we respect the right to protest, people&#x27;s day-to-day lives should not be disrupted, and criminal activity will not be tolerated. We remain fully committed to reaching net zero by 2050 and the UK is forging ahead of many other countries on net zero - with 40% of our power now coming from cleaner and cheaper renewable sources.&quot;</p>
