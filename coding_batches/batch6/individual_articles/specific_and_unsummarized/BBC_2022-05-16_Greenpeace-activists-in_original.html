    <p>Fifteen Greenpeace activists have been arrested after they blocked an oil tanker which they said contained a shipment of Russian diesel.<br><br>The group gained access to the Navigator Terminals in Grays, Essex, via boat, at 23:00 BST on Sunday and scaled the tanker&#x27;s berth.<br><br>The protesters unfurled banners that read &quot;oil fuels war&quot;.<br><br>Essex Police said they had all been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass.<br><br>Greenpeace said the 183-metre long Greek tanker was carrying a 33,000-tonne shipment of Russian diesel and they blocked it in protest at the UK government allowing fossil fuel money to fund the war in Ukraine.<br><br>Eight people, aged 27 to 72, were arrested in the early hours of Monday morning, with another seven arrested by 14:00.<br><br>Georgia Whitaker, oil and gas campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: &quot;The UK&#x27;s attachment to fossil fuels has backfired in the worst way possible - we&#x27;re funding a war, our energy bills and fuel costs are sky-high, and we&#x27;re driving the climate crisis. It has to stop.<br><br>&quot;Putin invaded Ukraine nearly three months ago, and yet fossil fuel money from the UK is still funding his war chest.</p>
