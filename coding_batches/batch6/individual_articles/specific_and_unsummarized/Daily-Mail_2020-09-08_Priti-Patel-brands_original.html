    <p>Priti Patel branded Extinction Rebellion protesters as &#x27;so-called eco-crusaders turned criminals&#x27; today as she vowed to crack down on their &#x27;guerrilla tactics&#x27;.<br><br>Speaking to the Police Superintendents&#x27; Association annual conference, the Home Secretary said she would not allow the group to cause &#x27;anarchy&#x27;.<br><br>The strong words come after XR&#x27;s printing press blockade which left some newsagents&#x27; shelves empty on Saturday morning.<br><br>Addressing the conference, held digitally due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Ms Patel said: &#x27;Now it is said that where there is no law there is no freedom, and that law and order is the cornerstone of our free society.<br><br>&#x27;And without it we have nothing. But events of the last week have exposed another emerging threat – the so-called eco-crusaders turned criminals.<br><br>&#x27;Attempting to thwart the media&#x27;s right to publish without fear nor favour. And a shameful attack on our way of life, our economy, and the livelihoods of the hardworking majority.<br><br>&#x27;I refuse point plank to allow that kind of anarchy on our streets.<br><br>&#x27;And I&#x27;m right behind you as you bring the full might of the law down upon that selfish minority.<br><br>&#x27;The very criminals who disrupt our free society must be stopped.<br><br>&#x27;And together we must all stand firm against the guerrilla tactics of Extinction Rebellion.<br><br>&#x27;And that means adapting to the threat that they pose and ensuring that justice is served.&#x27;</p>

    <p>Ms Patel said &#x27;attacking people&#x27;s jobs and livelihoods&#x27; is not &#x27;peaceful protest&#x27;.<br><br>She added: &#x27;These are not peaceful tactics. These are tactics that are deployed to cause maximum damage to society, blocking of roads for example.<br><br>&#x27;Last week we saw ambulances and blue lights not even being able to get through to hospitals basically, you know threatening people&#x27;s lives in addition to the economic wellbeing of our society at a time when actually we&#x27;re trying to get society up and running all over again.&#x27;<br><br>Ms Patel&#x27;s comments come after the Government said powers to help police deal with disruptive protests are &#x27;under constant review&#x27;.<br><br>Home Office minister Kit Malthouse accused some XR activists of seeking to &#x27;impose an extremist world view&#x27; on others, claiming the &#x27;worthy cause&#x27; of environmental campaigning is &#x27;undermined by their tactics&#x27;.<br><br>On Monday, he said he and Ms Patel are committed to ensuring the police have the &#x27;powers required to deal with the disruption&#x27; caused by groups, such as XR, telling the Commons: &#x27;I will keep the tools available to tackle this behaviour under constant review.&#x27;<br><br>He also said the tactics used by XR protesters will be examined to ensure police have the tools needed to &#x27;deal with&#x27; problems swiftly.</p></body></html>
