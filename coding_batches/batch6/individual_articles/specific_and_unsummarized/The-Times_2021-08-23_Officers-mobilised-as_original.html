        <h1>Officers mobilised as Extinction Rebellion protests kick off in Trafalgar Square</h1><p>Extinction Rebellion protesters have brought part of London’s West End to a standstill as police warned that the group’s actions would divert resources and hinder efforts to tackle violent crime.<br><br>Up to 1,000 activists marched from Trafalgar Square to Covent Garden where they set up a blockade.<br><br>Protesters erected a 13ft-high pink table at a junction near Leicester Square Tube station with “Come To The Table” written on it.<br><br>It is the first site to be blockaded and occupied by the group this year. It is reminiscent of the pink boat that protesters erected at Oxford Circus during demonstrations in April 2019.<br><br>Protesters quickly climbed on top of the table, which is equipped with sleeping quarters and areas where they can lock themselves in.<br><br>Others lay on the ground with their arms encased in a suitcase packed with concrete, as a means of preventing police from dispersing the protest.<br><br>Marion Malcher, 66, was among those lying in middle of Cranbourn Street with her arm in a suitcase. She said this was her first time locking on. “It’s certainly quite the experience,” she said.<br><br>The climate change activists claimed last week that thousands would take part in what it said would be two weeks of protests mainly targeting the City of London.<br><br>Police officers lined Whitehall, guarding the entrances to government departments. Territorial Support Group vans were also on hand. The unit is typically deployed to deal with major incidents such as terror attacks and riots.<br><br>The protest began with activists saying a Creole prayer to mark the 230th anniversary of the Haitian revolution that saw slaves overthrow French colonial rule.<br><br>Drawing comparisons between colonial rule and the climate crisis, a speaker told demonstrators: “Colonisers have always feared the indigenous people for their ability to commune with nature. Let us put an end to that global system of domination and set yourselves free.”<br><br>Activists from Animal Rebellion, an animal welfare offshoot of Extinction Rebellion (XR), were among the demonstrators.<br><br>Gail Bradbrook, co-founder of XR, told the crowd that nine activists were in police custody after members of the group scaled the Guildhall in the City of London yesterday. “This is not a protest, it’s a rebellion. The social contract between the people and the state is broken,” she said. “We are in an active rebellion against the British government.”<br><br>Over the weekend XR’s police liaison team met with the Metropolitan Police for what they described as a “positive discussion”.<br><br>But they said that they had given away little information as to what the group has in store over the course of the two-week protest.<br><br>Paul Stephens, a member of the XR police liaison team and a former Met detective sergeant, said that on previous occasions when the group had told the police about their plans, they had met with more heavy-handed policing.<br><br>One activist, who had travelled to London from Cardiff, said this was the second XR protest she had attended. “I’m looking forward to getting arrested,” said Zoella Took, 22. “It’s the least I can do given the situation we are in. It’s inspirational to be among so many people from all different backgrounds, genders, ethnicities, who are fighting for the same thing. It gives me hope.”</p><p>The Metropolitan Police said a “significant” operation would be put in place to manage the protests over the busy bank holiday weekend but acknowledged the activists’ “important cause”.<br><br>Matt Twist, deputy assistant commissioner, said: “It is clear to us from reading and listening to their public announcements that Extinction Rebellion’s intention is to once again cause significant disruption to London and to London’s communities through acts of civil disobedience.<br><br>“There have been three previous extended periods of demonstrations by Extinction Rebellion in London. People going about their normal business saw bus routes being diverted or cancelled, significant roads closures, tubes and DLR [Docklands Light Railway] routes being disrupted by spontaneous demonstrations, and the abstraction of hundreds if not thousands of officers from their normal duties.<br><br>“Like everyone else, Extinction Rebellion have the right to assemble and the right to protest. However, these rights are qualified and are to be balanced against the rights of others. They do not have the right to cause serious disruption to London’s communities and prevent them going about their lawful business.<br><br>“Undoubtedly, an operation on this scale will impact our policing in communities across London. Every police officer committed to a large demonstration is a police officer abstracted away from their local borough and community. Each painstaking hour spent dealing with a protester who has committed criminal damage, glued or locked on to a road or business, is time spent away from the people of London, in the parts of London who need us most, dealing with knife crime, domestic abuse, violence.<br><br>“I want our police officers to be serving Londoners, fighting crime as well as bearing down on our number one priority: violence. It is frustrating that activity by Extinction Rebellion will hinder those efforts.”<br><br>The movement has gained support from celebrities such as the comedian and author Stephen Fry and actor Jerome Flynn.<br><br>Flynn, who starred in Game of Thrones, attended yesterday evening’s protest in which three activists scaled the Guildhall.<br><br>A crowd of around 200 people gathered as the trio sprayed red paint over the walls of the building and unfurled a banner reading “co-liberation — freedom together”.<br><br>Flynn said it was “more urgent than ever” for people to take a stand. “We’ve gotten used to certain systems that are life-destructive; we created them, we’ve become addicted to them and we know the world is burning as a result,” he said.<br><br>“It feels needed and more poignant and more urgent than ever to come together. It’s time to collaborate; there are so many things that are trying to polarise us and pull us apart.”</p></body></html>
