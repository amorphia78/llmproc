    <p>In August, Reverend Coleman glued his hands to the road in a Just Stop Oil protest at the Navigator oil terminal in, Grays, Essex.<br><br>Four months earlier he was cleared of criminal damage after being accused of criminal damage by spraying Tory MP Chris Clarkson&#x27;s constituency office.<br><br>The case was dropped due to a lack of evidence.<br><br>He is a member of Christian Climate Action and was released from prison along with two other vicars, Reverend Bill White and Reverend Tim Hewes on September 22.<br><br>&#x27;I am Revd Mark Coleman, a priest in the Church of England. I was recently in Birmingham Prison for breaking an injunction which forbade protest outside the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire.<br><br>&#x27;I am committed to protecting people from disaster from a heating climate, particularly with the UK government&#x27;s plans for new oil and gas projects. These plans will push us further down the road to destruction.<br><br>&#x27;I have been active with the growing coalition Just Stop Oil and have been arrested four times for my non-violent action this year.<br><br>&#x27;Prior to that, I was involved with Insulate Britain, a fantastic group of people courageously drawing attention in the autumn of 2021 to the scandal of rising emissions from un-insulated homes, and the misery of premature death from cold and fuel poverty. I was arrested nine times for sitting on roads, largely the M25 motorway.<br><br>&#x27;It would be wonderful if some lovely people could help me carry the financial burden. I am retired with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and don&#x27;t have a future. I have calculated that fines, legal costs and travel to court have cost me just over £2000 in the last year.<br><br>&#x27;I have received just over £600 in donations to date. Anything you are able to give to help with the balance would be really kind and much appreciated.&#x27;</p>
