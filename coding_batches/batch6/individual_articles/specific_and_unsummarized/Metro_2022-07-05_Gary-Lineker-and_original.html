    <p>Former England footballer Gary Lineker has clashed with former Formula 1 driver Martin Brundle over the actions of the Just Stop Oil protestors who disrupted Sunday’s British Grand Prix.<br><br>Shortly into the race, a group of activists managed to break onto the Silverstone track and sat on the circuit in an attempt to get publicity for their cause.<br><br>Thankfully, the race had just been red-flagged due to Zhou Guanyu’s terrifying crash on the opening lap meaning no cars were running, and the small group were swiftly removed by marshals and security, but the dangerous stunt has received widespread condemnation, although there has been some praise for the overall campaign itself.<br><br>However, Lineker took to Twitter on Monday to issue his wholehearted support for the protestors, saying: ‘If it’s not already too late, history will look back very favourably on these people.’<br><br>This statement did not go down well with Brundle, with the Sky Sports pundit replying: ‘Gary please don’t encourage this reckless behaviour. They’d have been sliced into 100 pieces and fans, marshals and drivers were wholly at risk of injury and death.<br><br>‘We already had one lucky escape. I totally 100% support freedom of speech and opinion but do it responsibly.’<br><br>But the argument did not end there, with the Match of the Day host, who has long spoken out on environmental issues, retorting: ‘Way more risk of death with climate change to everyone than there is attempting to delay a motor race.’</p>

    <p>Some of those who were racing on Sunday, including Sir Lewis Hamilton and race winner Carlos Sainz Jr., have also shared their opinion on the protesters and the matter doesn’t seem to be going away very quietly.<br><br>This is not the first time Just Stop Oil has disrupted a sporting event this year, with protestors invading the pitch in the Premier League games between Arsenal and Liverpool as well as Everton and Newcastle back in March.<br><br>There is a sense of irony that the group targeted the grand prix for their latest stunt, given that F1 is leading the way in developing the most efficient engines and technology in the world.<br><br>By 2026, F1 cars will run on 100% sustainable fuel, while the entire sport is aiming to go carbon neutral by 2030.<br><br>MORE : F1 22 speeds straight to UK number one – Games charts 2 July<br><br>MORE : Christian Horner reveals doubts about Mercedes despite Lewis Hamilton speed improvement at Silverstone<br><br>For more stories like this, check our sport page.<br><br>Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on <br><br>Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.</p></body></html>
