    <p>Left-wing activists have taken to Twitter to slam the closure of Sydney Harbour Bridge this weekend for filming of Ryan Gosling&#x27;s The Fall Guy.<br><br>The closure comes weeks after climate change protester Deanna &#x27;Violet&#x27; Coco, 31, was sent to prison in December for eight months after she blocked a lane in April.<br><br>Twitter activists fumed at what they called a &#x27;double standard&#x27; after Ms Coco was put behind bars for what a magistrate called &#x27;selfish emotional&#x27; actions.<br><br>&#x27;Filming a Ryan Gosling flick closes the Harbour Bridge. All good. But a woman delays traffic on same to protest fossil fuels and she&#x27;s imprisoned. Got it,&#x27; one wrote.<br><br>Others agreed with the sentiment, seeing jail time for Ms Coco as quite excessive for blocking a lane of traffic on the bridge.<br><br>&#x27;Sydney Harbour Bridge closed this morning for filming. All lanes closed both directions to cars, bikes, pedestrians. What prison sentence will they get? Oh wait...It&#x27;s for money making purposes not for reducing emissions to save the climate,&#x27; they wrote.<br><br>Twitter activists fumed at what they called a &#x27;double standard&#x27; after Ms Coco was put behind bars for what a magistrate called &#x27;selfish emotional&#x27; actions. Pictured: Deanna &#x27;Violet&#x27; Coco being arrested<br><br>Yet another added: &#x27;Sydney Harbour Bridge closed for the filming of a move with Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt. Remember when the NSW Govt locked-up Violet Coco late last year? The cognitive dissonance is massive. Shut is shut.&#x27;<br><br>The bridge was closed from 3am to 10am in both directions. The Cahill Expressway was shut from 1am to 12.30pm.<br><br>The cycleway and footpath was closed from 5.30am to 10am. The Cahill Expressway walkway was closed from 2.30am to 12.30pm.<br><br>Photos from the bridge showed production was in full swing in the harbour city with  Ryan squatting next to his stunt double.<br><br>At one point he looked to be riding on the edge of a skip bin in scenes that take place on the bridge.</p>

    <p>The full-scale production saw the bridge filled with filmmaking equipment as well as a handful of cars and trucks for what would be the epic scenes.<br><br>Helicopters were also seen in the sky flying low as they filmed the high-octane scenes with the move reportedly also upsetting nearby residents.<br><br>Ms Coco (pictured) fronted Downing Centre Local Court in December before being sentenced to 15 months, with an eight month non-parole period<br><br>Climate change activist Deanna &#x27;Violet&#x27; Coco was sentenced to a minimum of eight months prison in December after blocking traffic on the bridge.<br><br>The court was told Coco drove a large hire truck along the Cahill Expressway on the bridge to purposefully block a lane during peak hour on April 13, around 8.30am.<br><br>While the truck was obstructing traffic, she stood on top of it, held a lit emergency flare and livestreamed the event.<br><br>After 25 minutes, police arrived and forcibly removed the protesters from the iconic Sydney landmark, with Coco resisting arrest.<br><br>Defence lawyer Mark Davis told the court a &#x27;salient fact&#x27; in Coco&#x27;s case was that she only blocked one lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge when there were five.<br><br>&#x27;One lane was blocked ... it was a deliberate decision to only block one lane,&#x27; Mr Davis said.<br><br>&#x27;To put it simply, the traffic may have still been moving, there was no suggestion there was backup of traffic.&#x27;<br><br>Coco was convicted and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight months. Her legal counsel immediately filed an appeal.<br><br>Coco is a serial protester and a member of climate activist groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Fireproof Australia.<br><br>She has been before the courts previously for rallying against a mining operation while topless and for setting fire to a pram outside Parliament House.</p>
