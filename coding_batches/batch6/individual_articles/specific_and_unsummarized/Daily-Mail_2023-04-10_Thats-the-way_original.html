    <p>Also involved with the protest group Insulate Britain, she has been involved in a number of demonstrations in recent months.<br><br>She was charged with three public nuisance charges in March last year after being arrested at least five times for blocking roads, including the M25.<br><br>Knorr, a student from Oxford, also said he felt he had &#x27;no choice&#x27; but to take part in the stunt because &#x27;we&#x27;re barrelling towards suffering, mass death and the annihilation of our species&#x27;.<br><br>In a statement, he said: &#x27;I cannot and will not commit myself to a future of powerlessly watching these horrors unfold.

We call on everyone involved in arts, heritage and culture to join us in civil resistance.&#x27;<br><br>Last year, Just Stop Oil engaged in protests at the Kingsbury Oil Terminal in North Warwickshire.<br><br>The group has also caused huge disruption with supporters climbing motorway gantries on the M25 and the QEII Bridge in Dartford, Kent, as well as blocking main roads in London.<br><br>A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: &#x27;We arrested two people following disorder at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry around 10am today (10 April).<br><br>&#x27;A woman, aged 67, and a man, aged 21, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause criminal damage and remain in custody for questioning.&#x27;<br><br>&#x27;Two large bags of dry paint were also seized by officers. We have Protest Liaison Officers remaining on scene to keep people safe and disruption to a minimum.&#x27;<br><br>Dippy, meanwhile, has proved hugely popular since taking up residency at the Herbert earlier this year, with crowds pouring in to see the diplodocus cast, dubbed Britain&#x27;s favourite dinosaur.<br><br>The exhibit is a life-size replica of a Diplodocus carnegii skeleton – a 26 metre-long dinosaur that lived 155-145 million years ago.<br><br>The dinosaur has been based at the Natural History Museum in London for more than 100 years, but took up residence in Coventry in February.</p>
