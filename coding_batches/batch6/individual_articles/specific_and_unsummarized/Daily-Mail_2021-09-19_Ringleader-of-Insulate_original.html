They will go on hunger strike.<br><br>&#x27;They will do all the things that have happened before in British history.

    <p>Conspiracy to cause public nuisance, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, is thought to be one of the punishments considered.<br><br>One police source told the Telegraph: &#x27;The disruption involved massively outweighs the offence and the protesters are well aware of that. Most of those involved have been arrested on suspicion of blocking the highway, which is a relatively minor offence.<br><br>&#x27;Even if these cases reach the charging threshold for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and it goes to court, the sentences available on conviction are very small. As we saw with some of the Extinction Rebellion protesters, they walk away with conditional discharges, which ends up encouraging others to take similar action.&#x27;<br><br>It comes after the Home Secretary held an emergency Zoom call with police chiefs after protesters from Insulate Britain shut down the UK&#x27;s busiest road during rush hour every 48 hours this week and made officers &#x27;look like idiots&#x27;, one Tory MP said.<br><br>The enviro-zealots even warned officers they would do it again after being released without bail conditions on Monday and Wednesday - with Hertfordshire Police defending the decision not to charge them claiming they still need time to &#x27;gather evidence and build a case&#x27; despite arresting dozens of them in the middle of the M25.<br><br>Surrey Police&#x27;s Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, Kent Police&#x27;s Chief Constable Alan Pughsley, Hertfordshire Constabulary&#x27;s Chief Constable Charlie Hall and Essex&#x27;s Ben-Julian Harrington are all in the firing line over their soft-touch response to the crippling protests.<br><br>A spokesman for the Association of British Drivers said: &#x27;The police have failed to do their duty. It&#x27;s time for Chief Constables to decide whose side they&#x27;re on. The actions of these people is an absolute bl**dy disgrace.<br><br>&#x27;They should be locked away. I&#x27;m appalled about why they have been released on bail with no restrictions. Not only have police not arrested these people for proper offences - they&#x27;ve not charged them with anything at all&#x27;.<br><br>A source close to the Home Secretary told MailOnline that at a Friday summit with police chiefs she reiterated her message that &#x27;these people are breaking the law and must be removed immediately&#x27;.<br><br>The insider did not go into what was discussed about the M25 - and how they would break the cycle of protests -  for &#x27;operational reasons&#x27;. But said: &#x27;The British public does not expect the police to be standing by while protesters disrupt people&#x27;s daily lives.&#x27;<br><br>Tory MP for South Thanet, Craig Mackinlay MP, said:  &#x27;I am surprised that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner has not advised her officers to make use of one of numerous possible legal provisions to prevent, remove, arrest and charge the activists within Insulate Britain, Extinction Rebellion and other anarchist groups causing mayhem to the law-abiding public simply trying to go about their normal activities and costing millions in lost business and valuable police time.&#x27;<br><br>One Tory backbencher told MailOnline: &#x27;Priti&#x27;s tough talking isn&#x27;t enough. These protesters are making the police look like idiots and the buck stops with the Home Secretary and her chief constables&#x27;.<br><br>Ms Patel is under growing pressure with some drivers taking to social media demanding she &#x27;sorts this mess out&#x27; or resigns. Others said Boris Johnson should sack her if police continue to &#x27;fail to keep roads open&#x27;.<br><br>Priti Patel had ordered police to take &#x27;decisive action&#x27; against the &#x27;selfish&#x27; eco-protesters and described the &#x27;guerrilla tactics&#x27; of Insulate Britain as &#x27;completely unacceptable&#x27;.</p>
