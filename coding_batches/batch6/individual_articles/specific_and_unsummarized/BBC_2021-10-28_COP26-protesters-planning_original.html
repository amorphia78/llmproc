    <p>Climate change protesters from Extinction Rebellion say they are planning high impact &quot;deliberate disruption&quot; during the COP26 summit.<br><br>World leaders and delegates will gather in Glasgow next week in a bid to hammer out a deal to tackle climate change.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion uses what it calls &quot;non-violent direct action&quot; to call on leaders to take urgent action on the climate emergency.<br><br>Its activists say they are prepared to be arrested.<br><br>But they will try not to affect the wider community by blocking routes used by emergency vehicles.<br><br>Catherine Idle, from the protest group, said: &quot;Our approach is to have deliberate disruption where it&#x27;s going to make the most impact.<br><br>&quot;There have been 25 COPs already and emissions are still rising and so we&#x27;re there to demand they do better.&quot;<br><br>Ms Idle said the activists cared about people and did not want to make going about their lives harder or more awkward.<br><br>&quot;The disruption is to get the attention of the people with positions of power,&quot; she said.<br><br>Greenpeace has been using non-violent direct action for decades. It will have representatives inside and outside the conference at Glasgow&#x27;s Scottish Exhibition Campus (SEC).<br><br>The organisation&#x27;s head of politics Rebecca Newsom said: &quot;Greenpeace activists will be there on the ground in Glasgow to try to make sure world leaders actually listen and step up and take action.<br><br>&quot;I can&#x27;t go into more details about what our plans are at this stage but hopefully they will help to have a big impact and contribute to that sense of pressure that world leaders need to feel.&quot;<br><br>COP26 will attract seasoned campaigners, veteran activists and ordinary members of the public, young and old.<br><br>On Saturday 6 November, as many as 100,000 people are expected to attend a march and rally organised by the COP26 Coalition, a broad alliance of groups and individuals.<br><br>World-famous climate activist Greta Thunberg is planning to attend, as is the less well-known Malcolm Macqueen, who chairs the Organic Growers of Fairlie.</p>

    <p>The group runs a community garden on old industrial land on the North Ayrshire coast and joined the COP26 Coalition to raise its concerns about land use and climate change.<br><br>A retired nuclear chemist, Mr Macqueen said: &quot;I think more and more of our gardeners and across Scotland have been quite concerned this year because we had a dry spell that lasted almost two months.<br><br>&quot;During that spell there was virtually no rain and that&#x27;s likely to become the norm unfortunately.<br><br>&quot;We want to go to Glasgow to make sure they know it&#x27;s at the top of our agenda.&quot;<br><br>Police Scotland will have 10,000 officers on duty every day during COP26.<br><br>The force says it will facilitate peaceful protests but won&#x27;t tolerate anything that disrupts the conference or the wider community.<br><br>Hundreds of officers have received riot training in case there&#x27;s trouble.<br><br>Extra cell capacity has been arranged and courts in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Falkirk, Paisley and Hamilton are preparing to deal will extra cases.<br><br>It is impossible to predict how widespread or disorderly the protests will be or the impact they will have, just as it&#x27;s impossible to predict how the conference will end.<br><br>A group of 20 grandparents from Belgium travelled to Edinburgh by train and are walking to Glasgow via the Union Canal.<br><br>One of them, Ria Gielas, summed up how many people feel about COP26 and climate change.<br><br>&quot;I do it for my grandchildren,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#x27;m very afraid for the future because the world is going to be dangerous.<br><br>&quot;The conference has to achieve many things. It has to be now. It has to happen now.&quot;<br><br>Insulate Britain&#x27;s roadblocking tactics in the south of England have attracted widespread publicity, but proved controversial.<br><br>The group&#x27;s press team told the BBC that COP conferences &quot;are killing our kids. There are currently no plans to attend&quot;.</p>
