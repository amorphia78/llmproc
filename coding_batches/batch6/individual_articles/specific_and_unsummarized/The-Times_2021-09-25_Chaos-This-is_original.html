        <h1>Chaos? This is nothing, warns Cambridge graduate who brought M25 to standstill</h1><h2>Cathy Eastburn, 54, is one of Britain’s most prolific protesters and has been arrested at least 12 times in three years</h2><p>There are not many women who would protest topless outside parliament. Or superglue themselves to a commuter train. Or sit down on the M25.<br><br>However, Cathy Eastburn, 54, a Cambridge University philosophy graduate, is not most women.<br><br>She is revealed today as one of Britain’s most prolific and hardline climate change activists, having been arrested at least 12 times in under three years.<br><br>Eastburn specialises in what she describes as “high-stakes” or “high-risk” direct action. During the M25 protests by the Insulate Britain group, she was arrested four times in nine days, with police releasing her without charge each time to run amok again.<br><br>The soft-touch approach by law enforcement agencies caught even Eastburn by surprise. Her out-of-office response to emails states: “If you’re reading this, it is because I have been arrested and possibly put in prison on remand.”<br><br>However, she remains a free woman this weekend. “I haven’t even been interviewed by police,” she said.<br><br>The blockading of the UK’s busiest motorway on five days during rush-hour caused gridlock and risked fatal accidents. It cost workers millions in lost earnings. A woman who was being taken to hospital after a stroke is said to have been left paralysed because of the delays.<br><br>Eastburn, a sound therapist and professional musician, said she sympathised with those affected by the traffic jams but insisted that the protests had been “proportionate”.<br><br>“I’m not a disruptive person and I really feel for people who are caught up in the disruption,” she said. “Sitting in traffic for a few hours is awful but it’s incomparable to the kind of chaos that’s coming down the track — massive flooding and major food shortages.”<br><br>Although images of Eastburn repeatedly being carted off by police have been splashed across the media her identity was not commonly known until now.<br><br>Her four arrests on the M25 barely scratch the surface of her eco-activism.<br><br>A veteran Extinction Rebellion (XR) supporter, Eastburn has been involved in many high-profile stunts, including an attempt to confront Sir David Attenborough at his home, while he was shielding from the coronavirus, “for not telling the truth”.<br><br>Despite being briefly jailed twice, Eastburn, who is married with two daughters, aged 17 and 21, has usually managed to go free with a slap on the wrist.<br><br>She lives in a home that is worth almost £1 million near Clapham Common in south London and readily admits to being in a “privileged” position.<br><br>Eastburn performs as a singer and percussionist in an Indonesian-inspired gamelan ensemble and uses gongs and chanting as a form of stress- relief for clients.<br><br>“Not everyone is in a position to risk arrest or risk prison,” she said. “I think as a white middle-aged woman, it’s easier for me to go through the criminal justice system.”</p>

    <p>Eastburn still feels she is making a “sacrifice”. “I don’t want to be spending my time in prison or spending my money on court costs. But it’s necessary. I’m doing this for my children and for children everywhere.”<br><br>She said that a UN report on global warming in 2018 prompted her to take part in non-violent direct action. The daughter of two school teachers from Cornwall, she likens her activism to that of the suffragettes and the US civil rights movement.<br><br>Eastburn was arrested and prosecuted for the first time in February 2019 after XR activists glued themselves to the doors of the InterContinental Hotel in London’s Park Lane as it hosted an oil conference.<br><br>About six weeks later she and two other protesters made headlines after bringing London’s Docklands Light Railway to a halt by gluing themselves to a train at Canary Wharf.<br><br>Eastburn was held on remand for just over a week at HMP Bronzefield near Ashford before being put on trial.<br><br>Jurors expressed “regret” after finding the trio guilty of obstructing the railway. They were each given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs.<br><br>In October 2019 Eastburn was arrested again, on suspicion of criminal damage, after a stunt involving fake blood being sprayed over the Treasury building in Whitehall.<br><br>Last September she was part of a group of women who removed their bras and locked themselves to railings outside the Houses of Parliament as part of wider XR protests across the capital.<br><br>“My younger daughter, who was 15 at the time, was mortified,” Eastburn admitted. She was also hauled away by police after blocking a nearby road. When she later appeared before Westminster magistrates, Eastburn illegally livestreamed the process of gluing herself to the wall of the dock. The action resulted in her being jailed for two weeks for contempt of court.<br><br>Her attempt to doorstep Attenborough, then 94, at his home in southwest London came after the naturalist and broadcaster warned people not to break the law for the green cause.<br><br>Eastburn argues that change can only come about through civil disobedience and that Attenborough, therefore, was “not telling the truth”.<br><br>She and five other XR activists approached the broadcaster’s house with gifts and an open letter in an attempt to “open a conversation” but Attenborough’s daughter told them that he was shielding.<br><br>Eastburn says she practises what she preaches. She is one of three vegans in her family and does not own a car.<br><br>Although she has made repeated trips to Indonesia in the past for her music career, she said she has given up flying. Speaking about her 12 arrests, Eastburn said: “I’m not proud of it. But I don’t feel what I’ve done is criminal. I feel like I’m preventing a far greater crime.”<br><br>@DipeshGadher</p></body></html>
