    <p>Around 60 Insulate Britain protesters staged a disruptive demonstration outside the Home Office in central London, blocking the road, lighting a fire and burning documents including their bail release papers. This action dodged a High Court injunction that only covered protests on the M25 motorway. <br><br>The group, including many who have been seen at multiple protests recently, sat brandishing homemade signs with messages such as &quot;Please act now.&quot; Some protesters provided their names and jobs, including Xavier Gonzalez, a trimmer, Janine Eagling, a bike instructor, and Stefania Morosi, a yoga teacher.<br><br>The demonstration came after the government obtained an injunction banning further Insulate Britain protests on the M25. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said activists could face contempt of court and potential imprisonment if they continue protesting on the motorway. However, the limited scope of the injunction allowed protesters to simply move to other roads not covered by the order.</p>

    <p><br><br>A spokesperson for Insulate Britain defended their actions, saying: &quot;We have to move quickly. What we do, I believe, in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity.&quot; They urged the government to make a meaningful statement on insulating homes, arguing it would save lives and reduce emissions. The group indicated they would continue their campaign despite the injunction.<br><br>The backgrounds of several protesters were revealed, including former soldier Donald Bell, who has a criminal past, and retired vicar Mark Coleman, who believes he is &quot;acting on God&#x27;s will&quot; by protesting. Other activists included a teacher married to an ex-BBC executive and a bricklayer who owns multiple properties.</p>
