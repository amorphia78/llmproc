        <h1>Sir David Attenborough: 'I've been talking about this for 30 years... and nobodyâ€™s taken any notice'</h1><h2>In an exclusive interview ahead of a new book and Netflix film, he discusses Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg and slowing down at 94</h2><p>In an exclusive interview ahead of a new book and Netflix film, Sir David Attenborough discusses his concerns about the state of the natural world and the urgent need for action on climate change. At 94, Attenborough shows no signs of slowing down, continuing to work on numerous projects despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>Attenborough&#x27;s new film, &quot;A Life on Our Planet,&quot; which he calls his &quot;witness statement,&quot; premiered in 550 UK cinemas last week and will be available on Netflix. The film, along with an accompanying book, represents Attenborough&#x27;s final stand on environmental issues. In it, he appears in person, talking directly to the camera in an unusually emotional and intense manner.<br><br>The renowned broadcaster emphasizes that while the situation is dire, it&#x27;s not too late to make changes. He points to successful examples of sustainability efforts around the world, such as Iceland, Paraguay, and Albania generating all their electricity without fossil fuels, and Costa Rica replenishing half of its previously cut-down rainforest.</p><p><br><br>Attenborough expresses support for young climate activists like Greta Thunberg, praising her as &quot;absolutely extraordinary&quot; and &quot;very realistic about the issues.&quot; However, he remains ambivalent about more disruptive protest actions, such as those of Extinction Rebellion, stating, &quot;The question is, are they putting people off by disturbing lives? I think it&#x27;s important that people should have their voices heard, that&#x27;s for sure, but I think breaking the law can have a deleterious effect.&quot;<br><br>Throughout his career, Attenborough has consistently warned about environmental dangers, but he feels that only now are people starting to take notice. He remains committed to raising awareness, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve had unbelievable luck and good fortune and I would feel so guilty if I recognised the problems and decided to ignore them.&quot;</p></body></html>
