    <p>More than 90 eco-warriors linked to Extinction Rebellion have been arrested after sparking travel chaos during a rush-hour blockade of the M25. Tens of thousands of drivers were stuck in their cars for up to five hours while activists from Insulate Britain plonked themselves in the middle of the motorway.<br><br>The whopping protest caused disruption at five junctions along the M25, including those for Swanley, Godstone, Heathrow Terminal 5, Kings Langley, and Purfleet.<br><br>Sam, from Bromley, who had been stuck in traffic for three hours with his two young children, said: &quot;I am seething at how irresponsible and selfish their demonstration is. It is ill-considered and poorly executed.&quot;<br><br>The climate change group wants the Government to &quot;make significant legislative change to start lowering emissions&quot;. A spokesperson said they were taking action to demand Boris Johnson create hundreds of thousands of jobs and save lives.</p>

    <p><br><br>Liam Norton, 36, an electrician from London said: &quot;Since waking up to the crisis we are all in, due to the catastrophic breakdown in our climate, I have been shocked at the lack of significant action from our government. They need to face up to reality. It will destroy our economy and the fabric of our society.&quot;<br><br>Steve Gower, 54, unemployed, currently living in fuel poverty in Gloucester added: &quot;Man up Johnson and get on with it.&quot;<br><br>AA president Edmund King said: &quot;This action is not only incredibly dangerous in potentially putting lives at risk but it also backfires in environmental terms by causing more delays and more vehicle emissions.&quot;<br><br>Officials advised drivers to find alternative routes as several exit slips remained closed due to the protests.</p>
