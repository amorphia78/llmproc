    <p>Climate activist group Just Stop Oil has been making headlines with their disruptive protest actions, including tying themselves to football goalposts, climbing on oil tankers, and stopping traffic. The group demands that the government stop the exploration, development, and production of fossil fuels in the UK.<br><br>Claudia Penna Rojas, a 24-year-old member who joined in February, explains, &quot;I found myself feeling just so completely and utterly helpless, and realised I had to take action.&quot; She adds, &quot;Now&#x27;s the time where we have to give it absolutely everything. It doesn&#x27;t really feel like a choice, it feels like a duty.&quot;<br><br>The group&#x27;s tactics have divided opinion, with some criticizing their disruptive methods and others praising them for raising awareness. Members have been arrested for offences such as criminal damage, and some politicians have condemned their actions for causing lives to be &quot;brought to a standstill.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Zak, a 15-year-old member, describes sitting on top of an oil tanker for about six to seven hours before being arrested. He acknowledges that being held by police &quot;isn&#x27;t the nicest thing&quot; but considers it &quot;incomparable to the consequences of climate change.&quot;<br><br>Just Stop Oil has faced criticism for being composed of &quot;middle-class, privileged&quot; young people. However, Claudia argues, &quot;If you have the privilege of being able to take that risk, then you have a duty to do so.&quot; Zak adds that the group includes people from various backgrounds who &quot;take time off work, some of them potentially risk their jobs.&quot;<br><br>Despite the challenges and risks involved, the activists remain hopeful that their actions can lead to positive change in addressing the climate crisis.</p>
