    <p>Just Stop Oil activists have announced an immediate halt to their protests on the M25 motorway. The environmental group has been blocking parts of the busy motorway for four days, leading to multiple arrests. A spokesman for the group stated that no protests would be held on Friday or in the &quot;foreseeable future,&quot; allowing the government &quot;to do the right thing.&quot;<br><br>The Metropolitan Police reported that 58 people had been charged over the four days of protests. Just Stop Oil&#x27;s primary demand is for the government to halt new licences for the exploration of oil and other fossil fuels in the UK.<br><br>During the protests, activists climbed on overhead gantries in multiple locations of the M25, causing the motorway to be closed. A police officer was injured during Wednesday&#x27;s protests when a collision occurred involving a police motorcyclist and two lorries during a rolling roadblock.<br><br>Chief Constable BJ Harrington warned that it is &quot;only a matter of time&quot; before someone is killed during a protest. The Home Office stated it was giving police strengthened powers to &quot;match the rise in guerrilla protest tactics,&quot; noting that the serious disruption is extremely dangerous and costs taxpayers millions while draining police resources.</p>

    <p><br><br>The protests were staged as the COP27 climate summit was being held in Egypt. The Just Stop Oil spokesperson called on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to consider his statement at COP27 regarding the catastrophic threat of global heating and the moral and economic imperative to honor climate pledges.<br><br>While the group has paused its M25 protests, they have not ruled out returning to the motorway in the future. The environmental activist group was founded after Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain, with organizers from both at the helm.</p></body></html>
