    <p>Thousands of police officers will receive public order training in preparation for the COP26 climate change talks in November, Police Scotland has announced. The UN summit in Glasgow, where world leaders will discuss emissions targets and climate finance, is expected to be the subject of large demonstrations.<br><br>Approximately 10,000 officers from around the UK will be deployed each day during the two-week event, making it one of the biggest policing operations of its kind in Britain. Prior to the summit, 2,500 officers will undergo specialist training to handle spontaneous or planned public order situations, such as protests.<br><br>Police Scotland emphasized its commitment to a human rights-based approach in policing any demonstrations during COP26, with de-escalation as a key tactic. Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr stated, &quot;We will protect the rights of people who wish to peacefully protest or counter-protest at COP26, balanced against the rights of the wider community.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The force is already engaging with known protest groups to ensure their rights to peaceful assembly and protest are met. Kerr added that Police Scotland was &quot;unlikely&quot; to deploy undercover officers, and if they did, the accountability measures would be &quot;incredibly and rightly onerous.&quot;<br><br>Quan Nguyen, Scotland coordinator of the COP26 Coalition, which is organizing protests in Glasgow on November 6, said: &quot;Protest and dissent are vital to a healthy democracy, and are how human rights and justice have always been won the world over. Without protest, the political will to act is just not there.&quot;<br><br>The announcement comes as the green credentials of host nation Scotland have been questioned by climate activist Greta Thunberg, who maintains not enough is being done to combat global warming.</p></body></html>
