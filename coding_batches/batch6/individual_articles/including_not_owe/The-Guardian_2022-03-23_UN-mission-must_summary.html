    <p>A UN mission is underway in Queensland to assess whether the Great Barrier Reef should be placed on an &quot;in danger&quot; list. Conservationists and the government&#x27;s reef envoy argue that the mission must visit reefs currently experiencing coral bleaching to get a complete picture of the reef&#x27;s condition.<br><br>The 10-day mission, which began on Monday in Brisbane, has kept its itinerary confidential. However, it is understood that briefings started in Brisbane, with visits to Lady Elliot Island, Cairns, and Townsville on the agenda.<br><br>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) is conducting aerial bleaching surveys across the 2300-kilometre reef. Dr David Wachenfeld, the authority&#x27;s chief scientist, has confirmed widespread but variable bleaching, stating that the flights will provide a clearer comparison with five previous mass bleaching events.</p>

    <p><br><br>Warren Entsch, the government&#x27;s reef envoy, emphasized the importance of the mission visiting bleached reefs, saying, &quot;They couldn&#x27;t see the whole picture unless they did. There should be no whitewashing. They have to see the good and the bad.&quot;<br><br>The mission will be briefed by scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, reef managers at the marine park authority, traditional owner groups, and tourism operators. Entsch added, &quot;They will talk to top scientists who have to make the decisions that we base our funding on.&quot;<br><br>Widespread mass bleaching of corals has occurred in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017, and 2020. This year marks the first time widespread bleaching has been observed during a La Niña year, which typically keeps the region cool enough for corals to avoid bleaching.</p></body></html>
