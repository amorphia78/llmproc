    <p>Business leaders have warned that thousands of oil and gas jobs could be at risk in the UK after Shell pulled out of the Cambo oil field development. Aberdeen&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce said a &quot;premature&quot; end to domestic production could see some areas suffer the fate of mining communities in the 1980s.<br><br>Shell, which has faced widespread criticism over its 30% stake in Cambo, said it now believed the economic case for investment was &quot;not strong enough&quot;. Greenpeace welcomed the announcement, describing it as the &quot;death blow&quot; for the plans.<br><br>However, industry body Oil and Gas UK insisted developments such as Cambo were still needed. Jenny Stanning, external relations director, said: &quot;This is a commercial decision between partners but doesn&#x27;t change the facts that the UK will continue to need new oil and gas projects if we are to protect security of supply, avoid increasing reliance on imports and support jobs.&quot;<br><br>Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, called for a &quot;reasoned debate&quot; about oil and gas extraction, which he said supported thousands of UK jobs. He warned against a &quot;knee jerk&quot; reaction to climate change, stating: &quot;If we get this wrong, all of those people and organisations demanding a premature end to domestic oil and gas production might want to be able to reflect back to their role in scripting a repeat of what happened to our mining communities in the 1980s.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Sir Ian Wood, chair of Aberdeen&#x27;s Energy Transition Zone, emphasized the importance of not creating an adverse investment environment at this crucial moment in the energy transition journey.<br><br>The UK government, which makes the final decision on whether to allow drilling, insists an environmental impact assessment will be carried out but appears far more supportive. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has said the new field should &quot;100%&quot; get the go-ahead.</p>
