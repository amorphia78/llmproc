        <h1>The Lorax review — this stripped-back musical falls flat</h1><h2>Old Vic, streaming</h2><p>This live-streamed revival of David Greig and Charlie Fink&#x27;s musical version of Dr. Seuss&#x27;s ecologically conscious tale, The Lorax, falls very flat at the Old Vic. Directed by Max Webster, this stripped-down version lacks the appeal of its 2015 premiere. The gospel-tinged songs seldom take flight, and the visuals are dowdy and uninspired. The backdrop of the empty auditorium is so dim, dark, and cramped that the show might as well be taking place in somebody&#x27;s attic.<br><br>The script, expanded from Dr. Seuss&#x27;s original five-minute tale to about an hour and a half, remains woefully undernourished. The villain is still the oddly named entrepreneur, the Once-ler, and we see more of his charmless family. However, the spectacle runs out of juice long before the interval.<br><br>Jamael Westman makes the best of the cardboard role of the Once-ler, while Audrey Brisson&#x27;s performance feels short-changed, spending much of her time as one of three puppeteers operating the modestly proportioned Lorax. The split-screen effects are cheap and cheerful at best.</p>

    <p><br><br>While the show has its heart in the right place, with free recorded screenings for schools planned for Earth Day on April 22, it ultimately fails to impress. The reviewer suggests saving your money and giving it to Greenpeace instead.<br><br>This production of The Lorax, despite its ecological message, fails to capture the magic of the original story or create a compelling theatrical experience. The Old Vic&#x27;s artistic director&#x27;s high praise for the original production seems at odds with this underwhelming revival.</p></body></html>
