    <p><br><br>Senior District Judge Paul Goldspring found Thelwell guilty of threatening behaviour, stating he had &quot;intended to cause King Charles to believe immediate unlawful violence would be used against him&quot;. The judge described the act as &quot;gratuitous and pernicious&quot;, particularly noting the pejorative comments made about the King.<br><br>Thelwell was given a 12-month community order with 100 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay costs of £600 and a £114 surcharge. Speaking outside the court before the verdict, Thelwell had said he had &quot;no regrets and no apology to the King&quot;.<br><br>The court heard that Thelwell had two previous convictions for public order offences relating to his participation in Extinction Rebellion protests.</p></body></html>
