    <p>Tens of thousands of climate activists from around the world took part in a series of mass demonstrations during the COP26 summit in Glasgow, with remarkably few arrests and no serious violence or damage to property.<br><br>Police Scotland reported only 70 arrests by Thursday, with a few more since then, mostly for minor public order offences. This low number is surprising given the scale of the protests and the anger of participants at the perceived lack of action from world leaders over the climate crisis.<br><br>One notable incident occurred when activists from Glasgow Calls Out Polluters blockaded a road outside The Engine Works in Maryhill, resulting in 16 arrests. In another instance, officers used power tools to release protesters who had locked themselves together to block St Vincent Street.<br><br>Despite these disruptions, the protests generally maintained a carnival-like atmosphere, contrasting sharply with the violent scenes at the 2005 G8 summit in Gleneagles, where about 700 people were arrested.</p>

    <p><br><br>Police Scotland deployed up to 10,000 officers at any given time during the conference, including specialists in public order, search, and firearms. The force adopted a strategy of avoiding confrontation, using dialogue rather than force to manage tense situations. Officers wore soft caps instead of riot gear at protests, contributing to a less aggressive appearance.<br><br>While the police&#x27;s overall approach has been praised for its effectiveness in maintaining order while allowing peaceful protest, there has been some criticism of &quot;containment&quot; tactics, also known as &quot;kettling.&quot; This controversial method involves trapping crowds in small spaces for extended periods, which has raised concerns about the treatment of innocent bystanders and protesters&#x27; rights.</p>
