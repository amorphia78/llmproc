        <h1>Chaos? This is nothing, warns Cambridge graduate who brought M25 to standstill</h1><h2>Cathy Eastburn, 54, is one of Britain’s most prolific protesters and has been arrested at least 12 times in three years</h2><p>Cathy Eastburn, 54, a Cambridge University philosophy graduate, has emerged as one of Britain&#x27;s most prolific climate change activists. She was recently involved in a series of disruptive protests on the M25 motorway, organized by the group Insulate Britain.<br><br>During these protests, Eastburn was arrested four times in nine days for her participation in blockading the UK&#x27;s busiest motorway. The actions caused significant gridlock and risked fatal accidents, costing workers millions in lost earnings. One reported incident involved a woman being left paralysed due to delays in reaching the hospital after a stroke.<br><br>Despite the chaos caused, Eastburn, a sound therapist and professional musician, insisted that the protests had been &quot;proportionate.&quot; She stated, &quot;Sitting in traffic for a few hours is awful but it&#x27;s incomparable to the kind of chaos that&#x27;s coming down the track — massive flooding and major food shortages.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Eastburn, who lives in a home worth almost £1 million near Clapham Common in south London, acknowledges her privileged position. She believes that as a white middle-aged woman, it&#x27;s easier for her to navigate the criminal justice system.<br><br>The activist claims she is making these sacrifices for her children and for children everywhere. Eastburn was prompted to engage in non-violent direct action after a UN report on global warming in 2018. She likens her activism to that of the suffragettes and the US civil rights movement.<br><br>Despite her numerous arrests, Eastburn remains committed to her cause. She argues that change can only come about through civil disobedience and states, &quot;I&#x27;m not proud of it. But I don&#x27;t feel what I&#x27;ve done is criminal. I feel like I&#x27;m preventing a far greater crime.&quot;</p></body></html>
