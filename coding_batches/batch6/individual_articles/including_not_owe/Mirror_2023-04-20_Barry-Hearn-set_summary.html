    <p>Barry Hearn, former World Snooker chairman, is planning to sue Just Stop Oil protestor Eddie Whittingham following a disruptive protest at the World Championship match between Rob Milkins and Joe Perry. The 25-year-old activist threw orange powder on the snooker table, causing the first session to be stopped.<br><br>Hearn expressed his anger at the incident, stating, &quot;That geezer who jumped on the table, he has upset me. He upset me a little bit more following his comment afterwards about he couldn&#x27;t care less about what happens.&quot;<br><br>The protest action affected approximately 400 spectators who had purchased tickets for the event. In response, Hearn is considering taking civil action against Whittingham on behalf of the affected fans. He plans to write to the spectators, offering to support them on a no-win, no-fee basis to recover costs incurred for tickets, travel, and food.</p>

    <p><br><br>Hearn emphasized his commitment to protecting the interests of ticket buyers, saying, &quot;People who buy tickets for my events matter to me. I am considering at this stage that course of action – that I will take a civil action against that protestor.&quot;<br><br>He also aims to send a message to potential future protesters, warning, &quot;I want to send a message out to anyone else who wants to try it – we will do you as well.&quot;<br><br>Whittingham, along with Margaret Reid, 52, who was allegedly attempting similar action on an adjacent table, have been bailed until June on suspicion of criminal damage.<br><br>Hearn&#x27;s proposed legal action is separate from any criminal proceedings, as he stated, &quot;I mean he also has a criminal case against him but that is nothing to do with me, that is the authorities.&quot;</p>
