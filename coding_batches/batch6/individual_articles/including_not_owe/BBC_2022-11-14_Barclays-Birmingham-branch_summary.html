    <p>A branch of Barclays in Birmingham&#x27;s High Street has been defaced with fake oil by climate protesters. At about 09:00 GMT on Monday, activists from Extinction Rebellion threw black paint on the bank and spray painted the words &quot;Europe&#x27;s biggest fossil fuel funder&quot; on the entrance door.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion said: &quot;We&#x27;re here to raise awareness to what Barclays is doing in investing in fossil fuels.&quot; The group also wrote on social media: &quot;Cut ties with Fossil Fuels. Your social license is ended.&quot;<br><br>West Midlands Police reported that four people had been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage and remained in police custody. A police spokesperson stated, &quot;We will always respect people&#x27;s right to lawfully protest, but lawful protest does not stretch to committing criminal offences. We cannot stand by and allow people to cause criminal damage to a building that is likely to result in disruption and repair bills.&quot;</p>
