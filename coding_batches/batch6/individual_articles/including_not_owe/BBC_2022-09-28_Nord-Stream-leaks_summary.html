        <h1>Nord Stream leaks: Sabotage to blame, says EU</h1><p>The EU has declared that leaks in two major gas pipelines from Russia to Europe were caused by sabotage, with European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen warning that deliberate disruption would meet the &quot;strongest possible response.&quot; However, the EU stopped short of directly accusing Russia.<br><br>The leaks were discovered in the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines, which run under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany. Danish authorities reported a loss of pressure in the pipelines, leading to warnings for ships to avoid the area near the island of Bornholm.<br><br>Seismologists reported underwater blasts before the leaks emerged, and Denmark&#x27;s Defence Command released footage showing large bubbles at the surface of the Baltic Sea. Bjorn Lund of Sweden&#x27;s National Seismology Centre stated, &quot;There is no doubt that these were explosions.&quot;<br><br>The Danish Energy Minister, Dan Jorgensen, said the leaks were likely to last for at least a week until the escaping gas runs out. An investigation has been launched into the incident.</p>

    <p><br><br>Mike Fulwood, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told the BBC that sabotage was indeed the most likely cause of the leaks. He noted, &quot;To rupture an offshore pipeline is a rare occurrence, so three in 18 hours would be a big coincidence.&quot;<br><br>The Kremlin has dismissed accusations of sabotage as &quot;predictable, stupid and absurd,&quot; with spokesman Dmitry Peskov expressing extreme concern about the leaks. He added that the possibility of a deliberate attack could not be ruled out.<br><br>The incident has raised environmental concerns, with Greenpeace warning that the leaks could have the same detrimental impact on the environment as 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. However, the German environment ministry stated that the leaks would not pose a significant threat to marine life.</p></body></html>
