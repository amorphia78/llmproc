    <p>Residents in Nottingham shared their views on Boris Johnson&#x27;s leadership following his victory in a confidence vote called by Conservative MPs. Among those interviewed were Fiona McFarlane and Monica Pallis, who were in town as part of a long-running Extinction Rebellion protest against Barclays.<br><br>Ms McFarlane, 73, who runs her own small business, was heavily critical of the prime minister&#x27;s actions. She stated, &quot;I think Mr Johnson has made an assault on democracy since he was elected, and by such dishonesty and by dismantling the checks on our democratic system he&#x27;s a danger to the country.&quot; She added, &quot;It&#x27;s a shame on the Conservative party that they selected him in the first place, and they&#x27;ve allowed him to continue as he has. He&#x27;s disgraced the role of prime minister.&quot;</p>

Peter Gordon, 53, believed it was time for Johnson to be replaced, citing his dishonesty and the negative consequences of Brexit. However, Gareth Bramley, a retired Nottingham resident, felt that Johnson should stay, describing him as having &quot;his heart in the right place&quot; despite coming across as &quot;a bit of a clown.&quot;<br><br>The article captures the diverse views of Nottingham residents on Boris Johnson&#x27;s leadership, ranging from strong criticism to cautious support, in the wake of the recent confidence vote.</p>
