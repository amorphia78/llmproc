        <h1>Government keeps coal power station open to boost security, in spite of lobbying to 'consign coal to history'</h1><h2>The business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said an extension would help bolster supply amid uncertainty in Europe after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but dismayed climate campaigners.</h2><p>The British government has extended the life of a coal power plant in a bid to &quot;bolster&quot; energy security, despite its previous efforts to phase out coal use. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng confirmed on Twitter that the government had struck a deal with EDF to keep West Burton power station online this winter, rather than closing it down in October as planned.<br><br>Mr Kwarteng stated, &quot;With uncertainty in Europe following the invasion, it&#x27;s right we explore all options to bolster supply.&quot; He added, &quot;If we have available back-up power, let&#x27;s keep it online just in case. I&#x27;m not taking chances.&quot;<br><br>The extension is expected to last until March 2023, with no further extension anticipated beyond that date. Discussions to keep two additional plants open are reportedly ongoing.<br><br>This decision comes as a surprise to many, as the UK government had previously lobbied other countries to &quot;consign coal to history&quot; during the COP26 climate summit last year. The move has dismayed climate campaigners, who view it as a step backward in the fight against climate change.</p>

    <p><br><br>Greenpeace UK&#x27;s policy director, Doug Parr, criticized the decision, stating, &quot;Unless the UK wants an international reputation as a hypocrite, these coal stations must lie idle unless there&#x27;s a genuine emergency shortage of gas.&quot; He urged the acceleration of renewable projects and the ramping up of home insulation to reduce demand.<br><br>The government maintains that for long-term energy security, they are still accelerating renewables and nuclear power while maximizing North Sea oil and gas production. However, this temporary reliance on coal highlights the ongoing challenges in balancing energy security with climate goals in the face of geopolitical uncertainties.</p></body></html>
