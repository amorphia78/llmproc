    <p>The year 2021 saw significant environmental protests and actions, with one of the most prominent being the tunnel protest at London&#x27;s Euston station. Nine activists announced they had secretly dug a tunnel beneath a tent to protest against the UK government&#x27;s high-speed rail link construction.<br><br>The protesters&#x27; action was aimed at disrupting the controversial rail project, which has faced criticism for its environmental impact. By occupying the tunnel, the activists sought to draw attention to their concerns and potentially delay construction work.<br><br>While the article does not specify the backgrounds of these particular protesters, it mentions that they were part of a broader movement of environmental activism taking place throughout the year. Their demands were likely focused on halting or reconsidering the high-speed rail project due to its perceived negative environmental consequences.</p>
