    <p>Two advocates from Extinction Rebellion Australia (ERA) have been arrested after gluing their hands to a priceless piece of art, triggering an evacuation at one of Australia&#x27;s biggest galleries.<br><br>A 49-year-old woman and a 59-year-old man glued their hands to the glass of a framed painting by Pablo Picasso, titled Massacre in Korea, at midday on Sunday at the National Gallery of Victoria. The pair stood either side of the 1951 piece, each with a hand glued to the glass and above a banner reading &#x27;climate chaos = war + famine&#x27;.<br><br>The stunt is the latest in the organisation&#x27;s calendar of disruptive demonstrations planned for its &#x27;Spring Rebellion &#x27;22&#x27;. Sunday&#x27;s risky protest was not advertised on the calendar.<br><br>&#x27;A clear reflection of Picasso&#x27;s pacifist beliefs, &quot;Massacre in Korea&quot; shows the horrors of war through a depiction of the final moments of a group of women and children held at gunpoint by dehumanised soldiers,&#x27; Extinction Rebellion wrote on Twitter.<br><br>&#x27;The banner reads &quot;Climate Chaos = War and Famine&quot; highlighted the connection between climate breakdown &amp; human suffering. According to David Attenborough, &quot;If we continue on our current path, we will face the collapse of everything that gives us our security&quot; - leading to conflict.&#x27;</p>

    <p><br><br>Police said the pair were arrested at about 2pm and were assisting with enquiries. An art curator was called to make sure the pair could be removed without harming the piece. The priceless painting was not damaged in Sunday&#x27;s protest.<br><br>People attending the gallery&#x27;s Picasso exhibit were shocked by the protest, with one person writing, &#x27;I&#x27;m at the Picasso exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria and just as I&#x27;m about to go up to his Weeping Woman some Extinction Rebellion protesters began yelling slogans and attached themselves to a painting in the next room!&#x27;<br><br>However, commenters under the ERA&#x27;s livestream applauded the protesters, with one person writing, &#x27;Thanks to this brave pair for highlighting the climate catastrophe.&#x27;</p>
