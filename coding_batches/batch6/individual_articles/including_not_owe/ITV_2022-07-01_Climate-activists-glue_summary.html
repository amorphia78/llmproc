        <h1>Climate activists glue themselves to Vincent Van Gogh oil painting at London gallery</h1><p>Two climate activists from the protest group Just Stop Oil glued themselves to a 19th century Van Gogh painting in London to protest new oil and gas extraction. Emily Brocklebank, 24, a psychology student from Leeds, and Louis McKechnie, 21, from Weymouth in Dorset, carried out the demonstration at the Courtauld Gallery on Thursday.<br><br>The pair stuck themselves to the frame of the 1889 landscape oil painting &quot;Peach Trees in Blossom.&quot; Ms Brocklebank said she was targeting the art world because it is &quot;focusing on the wrong things,&quot; adding, &quot;We need everyone to focus on the government&#x27;s genocidal plans to allow fossil fuel companies to drill for more oil. This is one of the greatest injustices in history. We must resist.&quot;<br><br>Mr McKechnie, who had previously chained himself to a goalpost during a football match, stated, &quot;The scientists are saying we need to end fossil fuel licensing and the government is pouring sand in their ears. I&#x27;m not willing to be marched to my death by the fossil fuel companies and their government puppets.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Several Metropolitan Police officers were seen attending the scene. The Courtauld Gallery reported that the painting appears undamaged but has been removed from display to clean the glue off its frame. A gallery statement confirmed, &quot;At 3.28pm on Thursday 30 June two climate protestors glued themselves to the frame of the painting Peach Trees in Blossom, 1889, by Vincent van Gogh in The Courtauld Gallery. Our initial assessment is that the painting is undamaged. The frame will require treatment to remove glue residue before the work can be returned to display.&quot;</p></body></html>
