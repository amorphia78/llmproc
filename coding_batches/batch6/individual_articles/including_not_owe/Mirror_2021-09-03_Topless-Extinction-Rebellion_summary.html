    <p>A topless Extinction Rebellion protestor plans to strip off across the globe to help fight climate change and change people&#x27;s views on activists. Laura Amherst, a 31-year-old Open University politics student, caused a stir at the ongoing &#x27;Impossible Rebellion&#x27; demonstrations in London.<br><br>Amherst insists her boyfriend supports her braless stance, even if he refuses to join her by removing his shirt. She says the police are happy for her to continue her protest, noting that her actions are not a criminal offence.<br><br>The activist aims to appeal to a different demographic, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m body positive and I&#x27;m sex positive - you don&#x27;t need to look a certain way to make a difference.&quot; She plans to take her protest on a global tour, saying, &quot;I want to go around the world, to different cities, to put this across. Whatever it takes to draw attention to climate change.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Amherst emphasizes the urgency of the situation, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re at a crunch time and we need new ideas and quickly - it is such a serious situation. If a boob world tour can help, then that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do.&quot;<br><br>The protestor returned to London&#x27;s streets on Thursday, clutching a cardboard sign reading &quot;Citizens Assembly on Climate Change&quot; as the group demanded an end to fossil fuel funding. She criticizes the government&#x27;s actions, stating, &quot;The government are not lowering emissions, in fact they have spent more on fossil fuel - they are doing more harm than most people know.&quot;<br><br>Amherst concludes by highlighting the severity of the climate crisis: &quot;It&#x27;s code red and by ignoring the problem they are destroying the future of millions and millions of people.&quot;</p>
