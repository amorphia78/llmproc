        <h1>UK climate minister received donations from fuel and aviation companies</h1><p>Graham Stuart, the Conservative MP for Beverley and Holderness and current UK climate minister, has received campaign donations from companies involved in fossil fuels and aviation. Stuart, who was appointed climate minister by Rishi Sunak in September, received a £10,000 donation towards his re-election campaign in 2019 from JR Rix &amp; Sons, a Hull-based business primarily involved in the distribution and sale of fuel, including heating oil, diesel and petrol.<br><br>JR Rix &amp; Sons&#x27; group of companies includes Rix Petroleum, Rix Heating (which specializes in oil tanks and boilers), Rix Shipping (operating oil tankers), and Maritime Bunkering (a major supplier of marine fuels). The company also claims involvement in offshore windfarm maintenance, carbon measurement, and development of low-energy technologies.<br><br>Additionally, Stuart received a £2,000 donation from Bostonair, a Hull-based aviation consultant. These donations have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given Stuart&#x27;s responsibilities for net zero strategy and low-carbon generation.</p>

    <p><br><br>Stuart has recently made controversial statements, claiming that a fresh round of oil and gas licensing is &quot;good for the environment&quot; and that not all fossil fuels should be &quot;viewed as the spawn of the devil.&quot; He has also expressed support for a new coalmine in Cumbria and the latest oil and gas licensing round.<br><br>Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, criticized the donations, stating, &quot;For dirty fossil fuel cash to go directly into the pockets of ministers, who then greenlight new oil &amp; gas licences and a climate-wrecking coalmine, is nothing short of a scandal.&quot;<br><br>A government spokesperson defended Stuart, saying, &quot;The minister publicly declared the donations for election expenses in line with usual processes. It is not unusual for ministers to receive donations in their capacity as members of parliament and there are well established processes in place to manage conflicts of interest.&quot;</p></body></html>
