        <h1>Just Stop Oil protester: I don’t care if I’m the most hated man in Britain — I’ll ruin my life to give others a future</h1><p>Louis McKechnie, a 21-year-old Just Stop Oil activist, has declared his willingness to become &quot;the most hated man in the UK&quot; if it helps achieve the group&#x27;s goals. The former engineering student at Bournemouth University gained notoriety last month when he ran onto the pitch during a Premier League football match between Everton and Newcastle United, attaching his neck to a goalpost with a cable tie.<br><br>As he struggled to breathe, to the jeers of thousands, one fan was captured brandishing a knife at McKechnie and another managed to evade guards before kicking him in the head. Despite acknowledging that the protest &quot;wasn&#x27;t exactly a day out in the park,&quot; McKechnie has returned to the front line this month and been taken into police custody another three times.<br><br>McKechnie says climate activists are undertaking these controversial protests to force firmer action by Boris Johnson, whom he accuses of &quot;green-washing&quot; by launching soft-touch climate policies. Just Stop Oil, which is affiliated with Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain, wants the government to stop all future licensing and consent for fossil fuel production and exploration.</p>

    <p><br><br>The activist has been arrested 17 times and served a prison sentence over the past year for his involvement in climate protests. He acknowledges the personal cost of his actions, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m throwing away my own future at the expense of everybody else&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t do this and study. And with a criminal record I can&#x27;t get a job. I&#x27;m not going to be able to do a lot of normal life things after this.&quot;<br><br>Despite the criticism and personal risks, McKechnie remains committed to the cause. He believes that he and his 19-year-old sister will not &quot;live to have grey hair&quot; if government climate policy is not radically strengthened. &quot;I would be ok with being the most hated man in the country if it means protecting my loved ones and the future of my generation in this country and all around the world,&quot; he stated.</p></body></html>
