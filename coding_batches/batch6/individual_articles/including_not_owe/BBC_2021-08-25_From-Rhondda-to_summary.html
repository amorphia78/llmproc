    <p>In 1981, amid growing fears of nuclear war, three sisters from Porth, Rhondda, decided to take action against the deployment of American cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common in Berkshire. Sue, Christine, and Lesley Brinkworth embarked on a four-year campaign that would see them sleeping rough at the Greenham women&#x27;s peace camp and going to prison multiple times.<br><br>The sisters&#x27; involvement began after Sue watched a BBC Horizon documentary about nuclear attacks. Concerned for her children&#x27;s future, they sought out the nearest branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and soon helped set up a march on Greenham.<br><br>As part of their campaign, the sisters participated in a radical action in September 1982. Along with 11 others, they stormed a police checkpoint at the camp gates, barricading themselves inside. Sue recounts, &quot;Once we got inside, we moved all the furniture up against the door to stop anyone getting in, and sat down for a long wait.&quot; The sisters were subsequently jailed for 14 days by Newbury magistrates after refusing to be bound over to keep the peace.</p>

    <p><br><br>This action helped publicize their cause, leading to the &quot;Embrace the Base&quot; event on 12 December 1982, where 30,000 women linked hands around Greenham. The protesters pinned images of &quot;life&quot; to the razor wire surrounding the camp, including baby clothes and photos of their children, to counter the &quot;death&quot; symbolized by nuclear missiles.<br><br>Despite facing opposition from police and locals, and having their property regularly confiscated, the sisters continued their protest for several years. Sue reflects on their efforts, saying, &quot;I think what we were striving for has direct parallels with the Extinction Rebellion movement and the fight against climate change, as big if not a bigger issue than what we were facing in the &#x27;80s.&quot;</p>
