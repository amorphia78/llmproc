        <h1>‘I won’t rest until my daughter is safe and out of that tunnel’</h1><h2>Environmental activist Roc Sandford explains the concerns – and pride – he feels over his daughter hiding underground to protest HS2</h2><p>Environmental activist Roc Sandford, 62, is deeply concerned about his 18-year-old daughter, Blue, who is hiding in 100ft of makeshift tunnels beneath Euston Square Gardens in London to protest against HS2. Blue, described as Britain&#x27;s answer to Greta Thunberg, entered the tunnels with a group of six other protesters more than two weeks ago.<br><br>The protesters include Daniel Hooper, the 47-year-old green campaigner known as &quot;Swampy&quot;, and his 16-year-old son, Rory. Sandford believes Blue has enough food to last her for six weeks and is keeping in touch via her mobile phone.<br><br>The tunnels are dark and dangerous, lacking proper safety equipment and oxygen monitors. Machinery could destabilize the tunnels, according to safety experts. Sandford expresses deep concern for his daughter&#x27;s safety, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m very concerned for her safety.&quot;<br><br>Blue, who has been on a school strike since completing her GCSEs at a private school in north London, has written a book called &quot;Challenge Everything&quot; encouraging young people to save the world. Sandford describes her as tough and safety-conscious, having grown up between the harsh conditions of Gometra island and an off-grid house in London.</p>

    <p><br><br>Sandford supports his daughter&#x27;s protest, despite the government stating that the cost of tackling climate activists at HS2 sites has hit nearly £50 million. He believes there is no place for a new fast train network requiring a huge amount of carbon. &quot;People are in denial; the world has changed – it&#x27;s like the third runway at Heathrow and the coalmine in Cumbria – the sooner these projects are cancelled, the less money is wasted and the fewer lives are put at risk,&quot; he says.<br><br>While acknowledging his privileged position, Sandford argues that everyone must act to protect the environment. He draws parallels with historical figures, stating, &quot;The experiences of Gandhi, Martin Luther King and the suffragettes show us that when a government isn&#x27;t doing what it needs to be doing in a crisis, non-violent direct action is a way to wake it up.&quot;</p></body></html>
