    <p>Thousands of Extinction Rebellion protesters have descended on Parliament Square in London leading to at least 90 arrests, as the group kicked off 10 days of civil disobedience to demand government action on the climate crisis.<br><br>Four XR groups blocked roads as they marched across central London waving brightly coloured flags and banners demanding MPs back what they have described as the &quot;climate and ecological emergency bill&quot;. A number of protesters sat in the middle of an intersection next to Parliament Square blocking traffic, as dozens of police officers swooped in to carry them away to vans parked nearby.<br><br>The Metropolitan police issued restrictions under section 14 of the Public Order Act to limit the protest to the off-road area of Parliament Square gardens. Commander Jane Connors of the Met said: &quot;The reason we have implemented these conditions is that we know these protests may result in serious disruption to local businesses, commuters and our communities and residents, which I will not tolerate.&quot;<br><br>In contrast to the group&#x27;s rebellion in October 2019, organisers said the focus this time is intended to be institutions of power, with disruption aimed at the heart of Westminster and timed to start on the day MPs returned to parliament from summer recess.</p>

    <p><br><br>The Green MP Caroline Lucas addressed the crowd in Parliament Square to announce that she would table the climate and ecological emergency bill: &quot;Thank you for showing more political leadership than that place over there,&quot; she said, gesturing to the House of Commons.<br><br>Many protesters said the pandemic had made them more determined to protest. &quot;By living the way we live, we are making ourselves more vulnerable to these pandemics and that&#x27;s why [the climate crisis] should never have been off the agenda, it should be part and parcel of the Covid debate,&quot; said 50-year-old Ava, from Lewes in East Sussex.<br><br>The vast majority of those taking part were wearing masks, and XR said a digital rebellion was taking place online for those unable to attend the demonstrations in person.</p></body></html>
