    <p>Nine people have been arrested after thousands gathered in central London to demonstrate against a proposed bill which will hand greater power to police to shut down protests deemed overly noisy or disruptive.<br><br>Thousands of protesters congregated around Trafalgar Square and the Mall for the &quot;Kill the Bill&quot; demonstration from midday on Saturday. Later in the afternoon, the demonstrators headed towards the Home Office.<br><br>The protest, which was spearheaded by anti-domestic violence charity Sisters Uncut, also featured many placards supporting environmental activists Extinction Rebellion (XR) and the Black Lives Matter movement.<br><br>The proposed legislation would give police in England and Wales more powers to impose conditions on non-violent protests – including those deemed too noisy or a nuisance, with those convicted liable to fines or jail terms.</p>

    <p><br><br>Commander Simon Dobinson, of the Metropolitan Police, said ahead of the protests: &quot;We have attempted to make contact with the organisers of Saturday&#x27;s demonstrations. It is their responsibility to comply with the regulations and ensure their gathering is safe.&quot;<br><br>He added: &quot;Officers will be present to try to engage with protestors, to explain the restrictions, encourage compliance and take steps to enforce the restrictions if it is necessary to do so.&quot;<br><br>A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;The right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but over recent years we have seen an increase in the use of disruptive and dangerous tactics. These new measures will not stop people from carrying out their civic right to protest and be heard, but will prevent large scale disruption – enabling the silent majority to get on with their lives.&quot;</p></body></html>
