    <p>Sir Chris Hohn, the billionaire hedge fund manager, has paid himself $479m (£343m) last year, believed to be the highest annual amount ever paid to one person in Britain. This staggering sum equates to £940,000 a day, which is 9,000 times the average UK salary and 1,700 times the amount paid to the prime minister, Boris Johnson.<br><br>The payment came as Hohn&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Investment (TCI) fund recorded a 66% jump in pre-tax profits to $695m. The dividend was paid from TCI to Hohn&#x27;s personal company TCI Fund Management (UK) Limited, according to a Companies House filing. The pay was for the year to 29 February 2020.<br><br>Hohn, 54, is the son of a Jamaican car mechanic who emigrated to Britain in the 1960s. His hedge fund, TCI, holds big stakes in Visa, Microsoft, Google&#x27;s owner Alphabet, and a controversial Canadian oil transportation railway company. The fund is based in Mayfair, London, but is ultimately owned by a parent company in the Cayman Islands tax haven.</p>

    <p><br><br>Despite his enormous wealth, Hohn is known for his philanthropy. He gave away $386m through his personal charity, the Children&#x27;s Investment Fund Foundation, in 2019. Hohn has also made tackling the climate crisis central to the mission of his hedge fund and charity, targeting companies that fail to disclose their carbon emissions.<br><br>The High Pay Centre&#x27;s Luke Hildyard, who campaigns against excessive executive pay, called for higher taxes on top earners such as Hohn, arguing that such extreme payouts demonstrate the potential for highly profitable companies to pay their staff more and for super-rich individuals to pay more tax.</p></body></html>
