    <p>In today&#x27;s newsletter: One million people have already been displaced by the country&#x27;s second famine in just over ten years. This is how Somalia found itself in a dire situation once again.<br><br>Yesterday in Birmingham, Liz Truss had her speech interrupted by Greenpeace activists. Two climate protesters disrupted the prime minister&#x27;s speech at the Conservative party conference. The activists had the presence of mind to bring a second sign – reading &quot;Who voted for this?&quot; – to pull out when their first one was removed by security. The loudest applause during the speech came when the embattled PM was interrupted by these protesters.<br><br>The situation in Somalia is infinitely more severe. One million people have been displaced by the worst drought the country has seen in decades. There have been harrowing reports of hungry families having to bury loved ones on the side of the road as they journey for days, and sometimes weeks, in search of assistance or aid. Those who reach the camps in urban centres often receive little to no help. The situation is only worsening, with the UN warning that &quot;famine is at the door&quot; in Somalia.</p>

    <p><br><br>The climate crisis has played a significant role in Somalia&#x27;s dire situation. People in Somalia are accustomed to dry spells and drought, but the latest one has left the country on its knees. Agro-pastoralists and farmers who have survived countless dry seasons are unable to produce sufficient crops – the extreme heat has also killed 3 million livestock. Scientists from Nasa say that the drought has been caused by the La Niña weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean and the climate crisis.<br><br>Even though collectively Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya emit just 0.1% of total global CO2 emissions, they have been paying the highest price for the climate crisis. Alongside the drought, there have been a series of other extreme weather events like cyclones and flash floods, as well as locust infestations: all of these are exacerbated and made more likely by the climate crisis.</p>
