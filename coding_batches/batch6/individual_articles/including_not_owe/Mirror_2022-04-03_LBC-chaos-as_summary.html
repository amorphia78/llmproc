    <p>LBC radio station descended into chaos on Sunday morning when a guest glued themselves to a microphone and refused to leave the studio. Just Stop Oil spokesperson Nathan McGovern had been chatting to presenter Tom Swarbrick when he took issue with the station&#x27;s handling of his eco-friendly message.<br><br>McGovern accused LBC of &#x27;not using their massive platform&#x27; to share the dangers of climate change, while taking out a tube of glue from his pocket. He then proceeded to stick his left palm to the microphone.<br><br>Alerting listeners to what was going on in the studio, Swarbrick said: &quot;For those of you listening wondering what the banging on the microphone is, Mr McGovern seems to have, you&#x27;ve glued yourself to the microphone? That&#x27;s fantastic.&quot;<br><br>Explaining his course of action, McGovern told the host: &quot;You have a massive platform, a microphone that you can use to tell people about the situation we&#x27;re in and you&#x27;re not using it. An ordinary person like me is having to take the microphone and tell your viewers the situation we are in.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The incident led to Swarbrick having to change studios to continue his show.<br><br>After the drama, Just Stop Oil posted a statement on social media: &quot;Every new oil and gas facility tightens the noose around the necks of our young people. If the media will not communicate their predicament they will have no choice but to take the microphone.&quot;<br><br>Shocked listeners took to Twitter to share their divided reaction over what they had just witnessed. Some criticized the protester&#x27;s methods, while others noted that the activist had raised several good points before the disruption.<br><br>The protest action aimed to draw attention to the urgency of addressing climate change and the perceived lack of media coverage on the issue.</p>
