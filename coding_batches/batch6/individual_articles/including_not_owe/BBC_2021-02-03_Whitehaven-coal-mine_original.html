    <p>Criticism of plans for the UK&#x27;s first deep coal mine in 30 years is misplaced and has provoked &quot;real anger&quot;, the local mayor has said.<br><br>The mine, near Whitehaven, was approved by Cumbria County Council and the government has declined to intervene.<br><br>Coking coal from the mine, to be used in producing steel, would &quot;drive forward green energy projects&quot;, Copeland mayor Mike Starkie claimed.<br><br>Opponents say the site will cause significant environmental damage.<br><br>Mr Starkie said he believed people across West Cumbria were overwhelmingly in favour of the scheme as it would &quot;underpin an economic revitalisation&quot; by providing hundreds of jobs.<br><br>The Conservative mayor said: &quot;This is Â£160m-worth of private sector investment being injected into a post-Covid economy. It&#x27;s going to drive forward the West Cumbrian economy, creating a lot of opportunity for the people who live here.<br><br>&quot;This is about fixing the problem [of local deprivation] permanently by putting people into good, sound, secure employment.<br><br>&quot;Whether it&#x27;s solar, wave, nuclear power, it&#x27;s all going to need significant amounts of steel. At the moment, there&#x27;s no economic way of making steel without coking coal.</p>

    <p>&quot;People have just got to open their eyes and take a balanced view on this,&quot; he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.<br><br>Woodhouse Colliery, proposed by the firm West Cumbria Mining, has permission to operate until 2049.<br><br>After the government announced it would not call in the project, the chairman of its Climate Change Committee, Lord Deben, wrote to planning minister Robert Jenrick warning the mine would &quot;commit the UK to emissions from coking coal, for which there may be no domestic use after 2035&quot;.<br><br>Groups such as Extinction Rebellion Cumbria and Keep Cumbrian Coal in the Hole have voiced opposition too, while South Lakes Lib Dem MP Tim Farron described the scheme as &quot;an almighty backwards step&quot; and &quot;a disaster for our children&#x27;s future&quot;.<br><br>Greenpeace and environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg are among others to have expressed concerns.</p></body></html>
