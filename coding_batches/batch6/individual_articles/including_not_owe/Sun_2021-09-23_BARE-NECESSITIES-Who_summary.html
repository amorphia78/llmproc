    <p>Laura Amherst, a 31-year-old mum and politics student from Brighton, East Sussex, hit the headlines as the topless Extinction Rebellion (XR) campaigner seen at a number of protests in London. The eco-warrior became widely known after she went topless during several XR protests in London in September 2021, claiming she was doing it to &quot;draw attention to the threat of climate change&quot;.<br><br>Amherst&#x27;s topless displays went viral as she joined XR activities designed to bring London to a standstill. Her protests have come under fire from people online who claim she&#x27;s &quot;attention-seeking&quot;, &quot;wants to be an influencer&quot; and told her to put her clothes on. The mum-of-one told The Sun: &quot;Recently I was fat-shamed, people have said, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got so many rolls on your body I don&#x27;t want to have to see that&#x27;. Others have called me &#x27;disgusting&#x27; and someone even said &#x27;I&#x27;ll turn vegan if you let me motorboat them&#x27;.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Defending herself against critics, Amherst said, &quot;They love to rip into me because I have fake boobies and say, &#x27;Oh, she must be a horrid person looking for attention,&#x27; but they have me all wrong.&quot;<br><br>Her topless protests even drew the attention of Piers Morgan. The former Good Morning Britain host joked about the writing on her chest, which read &#x27;Wake Up&#x27;, being &quot;unexpected publicity&quot; for his book of the same name.<br><br>Amherst calls herself &quot;Climate T**s&quot; on Twitter and can be found on various social media sites, including Instagram under the name @lauraamherstxr, where she has 17,000 followers.</p></body></html>
