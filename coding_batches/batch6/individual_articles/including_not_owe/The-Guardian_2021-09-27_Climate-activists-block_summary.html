    <p>Dozens of activists from Insulate Britain have defied a high court injunction by staging their sixth roadblock on or near the M25 since 13 September. Fifty-three protesters, some of whom had glued themselves to the tarmac and barriers on a slip road to the M25 at junction 14 near Heathrow, disrupted the Monday morning rush-hour for at least 90 minutes.<br><br>The demonstration, part of a campaign by Insulate Britain to tackle fuel poverty and reduce the UK&#x27;s carbon dioxide emissions, ended when protesters were taken away by police. The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, vowed that the campaign would continue until the government took action to insulate homes.<br><br>Despite the threat of imprisonment and unlimited fines for breaching a high court injunction, activists remained defiant. Craig Scudders, a spokesman for the group, told Sky News: &quot;We are on the right side of this argument. Priti Patel, I have a message for you â€“ that we are going nowhere. There is going to be wave after wave of wave of protesters willing to spend time in prison and possibly lose their savings because this is an issue that is not going away.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Among the protesters were Dr Diana Warner, 62, a retired GP from Bristol, and Victoria Lindsell, 66, a volunteer language teacher. Both expressed their determination to continue the disruptive protests despite the inconvenience caused to drivers.<br><br>The protest infuriated the drivers&#x27; lobby, with some groups demanding action against what they called a &quot;criminal conspiracy to repeatedly block roads.&quot; Howard Cox, the head of FairFuelUK, referred to the activists as &quot;scum&quot; who should be imprisoned and have their assets stripped to pay for the disruption caused.<br><br>A spokeswoman for Insulate Britain maintained that the actual disruption was minor and that protesters were prepared to face the consequences of their actions in pursuit of their goal to pressure the government into insulating homes.</p></body></html>
