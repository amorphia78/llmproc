    <p>Contingency plans are in place to move Britain&#x27;s nuclear weapons to France or the US if Scotland gains independence, it was reported last night. The UK&#x27;s four nuclear submarines, armed with Trident missiles since 1996, have been based at HMNB Clyde at Faslane in western Scotland since 1968. A secondary base at Coulport, less than ten miles away, is where missiles are routinely stored.<br><br>Ministers are said to have drawn up plans to move the vessels to naval bases in the US or France in the event of the break-up of the Union. The Ministry of Defence might also try to lease the existing naval bases, creating a British Overseas Territory within Scotland which has been dubbed &#x27;Nuclear Gibraltar&#x27; by some insiders.<br><br>The first and preferred option would reportedly be to relocate the submarines to the Royal Navy base at Devonport in Plymouth. Senior officials told the Financial Times they had been briefed on the contingency plans, which they said showed the difficult choices potentially ahead.</p>

    <p><br><br>If Britain&#x27;s nuclear weapons were to move to the US, a likely location would reportedly be Kings Bay, in Georgia. This option is said to be preferred by the Treasury because it would be the least expensive. However, basing Trident outside Britain may make it more difficult to defend the country&#x27;s sovereignty in the event of a military threat.<br><br>If the submarine base were to be moved to France, it was reported that the vessels would go to the home of the French nuclear fleet, at Île Longue in Brittany in the north of the country.<br><br>The MoD last night said: &quot;The UK is strongly committed to maintaining its credible and independent nuclear deterrent at HM Naval Base Clyde, which exists to deter the most extreme threats to the UK and our Nato allies. There are no plans to move the nuclear deterrent from HM Naval Base Clyde (Faslane), which contributes to Scotland&#x27;s and the wider UK&#x27;s security and economy, and its supporting facilities are safe for local communities.&quot;</p>
