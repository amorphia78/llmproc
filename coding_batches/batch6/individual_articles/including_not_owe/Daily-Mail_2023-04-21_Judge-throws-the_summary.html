    <p>Two Just Stop Oil protestors who scaled a bridge over the Dartford Crossing and caused 40 hours of gridlock have been jailed for five years in a record sentence for the climate group.<br><br>Morgan Trowland, 40, and Marcus Decker, 36, blocked one of the busiest stretches of road in the country during their climate protest on October 17 last year. The pair hoisted a banner between two pillars of the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, which links the M25 in Essex and Kent, and slept in hammocks in freezing temperatures overnight.<br><br>The road beneath was closed by police for fears over their safety, causing traffic chaos - they were eventually arrested after coming down the following day. Trowland and Decker were jailed for three years, and two years and seven months respectively at Southend Crown Court, after being found guilty of causing a public nuisance.<br><br>Judge Shane Collery KC said locking the pair up would hopefully deter anyone else from taking part in similar demonstrations. &quot;You have to be punished for the chaos you caused and to deter others from copying you,&quot; he said.</p>

    <p><br><br>The judge noted that the disruption affected &quot;many tens of thousands, some very significantly&quot;. Essex Police said that those impacted included a &quot;heavily pregnant woman who needed urgent medical help&quot; and a person who missed the funeral of their best friend of 35 years. A business lost more than Â£160,000 in earnings.<br><br>Trowland, a structural engineer, and Decker, a private tutor with two degrees, argued that it was a protest. Trowland had said in evidence: &quot;We climbed it to deliver a warning message and to speak that message through interviews with journalists.&quot; He said the group&#x27;s goal is to get the Government to stop licensing oil and gas production.<br><br>Just Stop Oil claimed it would &quot;not be deterred by these draconian sentences&quot;. A spokesperson said: &quot;Until the Government commits to no new oil and gas we will continue in our campaign of resistance.&quot;</p>
