IMPORTANT NOTE!!!
This analysis compares batch 6 (pre-study-period) with batch 7 (study period) which is not the same as comparing pre-study-period with study period, because (1) batch 7 was balanced to quotas and batch 6 was not; (2) implementation of owe-specific shifted a bit between the two (this latter factor probably not very important). We get some indication of changes from this analysus but it isn't watertight.
