The-Times_2023-11-27_Climate-activists-glue-50	llm	balance	"The original article ends with three sentences of a statement by Barclays bank defending themselves from the protesters' accusations. None of this material is included in the summary, which means that the overall balance has shifted from the original to be more sympathetic to the protesters in the summary. This must be fixed by including at least some summarised material from the Barclays statement."			
The-Times_2024-07-27_Mum-got-four-years	llm	balance	"The summary alters the tone and balance of the original article. The original article presents a sympathetic, humanizing portrait of Louise Lancaster through extensive quotes from her family members who describe her as ""unrelentingly kind,"" and as someone who ""listens more than she speaks"" and who struggled with the decision to inconvenience people. The family's perspective dominates the original, explaining her careful reasoning process, her previous attempts at conventional activism, and the personal costs she has endured. In contrast, the summary strips away almost all of this humanizing context and family perspective, instead leading with and emphasizing the judge's characterization of Lancaster and others as having ""crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic."" The summary focuses primarily on the disruption caused and the legal proceedings, while relegating the family's supportive view to just a brief mention in the subtitle. The key aspects of the protest itself must be covered, but not at the expense of losing changing the article's tone which is sympathetic, family-focused, and includes the personal story of why Lancaster felt compelled to act."

Sun_2024-07-19_JUST-APPALLING-I-went	llm	balance	"The summary alters the tone and balance of the original article. The original maintains a strong negative portrayal of the protesters throughout, describing them as ""eco zealots,"" a ""cult,"" and ""fanatics,"" with extensive coverage of the journalist's undercover operation, court proceedings, and vindication of The Sun's reporting. The summary removes most of this critical framing, including the cult-like characterization, the judge's condemnation of the protesters as ""fanatics,"" and The Sun's celebration of their role in stopping the protest. The key aspects of the protest itself must be covered, but not at the expense of losing the original's strongly negative editorial stance against the protesters."

The one saying The Energy Intelligence Forum is a 'platform for fostering debate...and finding answers to the big questions facing the energy industry' is required."

Metro_None_Three-JSO-protesters-charged	llm	balance	"The summary conflates the two different actions. Most of the criticism is of the earlier action and has therefore been omitted. For balance, we need to squeeze in the quote from the judge saying it was 'offensive' for Plummer to portray herself as a political prisoner. That was for the original action; also the 'What is worth more, art or life?' quote is from the original action. The final section must have both these quote sets and be clearly about the earlier action. To make space, earlier material that is less important can be removed, e.g., where the protesters live."

Replace it with a sentence or two about the fact that this action came as others were jailed for a similar action."

There are two paragraphs in the original, starting 'A spokesperson for the campaign said: “Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023...' and 'How many fathers will be imprisoned...'. The first of these is included in the summary, but not the second, even though it is more powerful. There is not space for both paragraphs in the corrected summary, but try to include the strongest elements. It's OK to slightly misquote."

The-Times_2024-06-02_Attacking-art-should-be	llm	incongruity (photo-related)	"There is an issue with the final paragraph, which in the summary became ""Officials in France and other European countries have struggled to deal with activists who attack the glass protecting major works without damaging the art itself."" The issue is that the photo that accompanies that section of the article is of the Magna Carta protest. The summarisation removed any information about the Magna Carta so the photo becomes incongruous. A mention of the Magna Carta action is needed in this paragraph. Be careful, however, with words like ""work"", which in the context implies artistic work, but the Magna Carta is a historical artefact, not an artwork, although important culturally. No need to mention Girl with the Pearl Earring"
