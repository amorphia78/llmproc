The original maintains a strong negative portrayal of the protesters throughout, describing them as ""eco zealots,"" a ""cult,"" and ""fanatics,"" with extensive coverage of the journalist's undercover operation, court proceedings, and vindication of The Sun's reporting. The summary removes most of this critical framing, including the cult-like characterization, the judge's condemnation of the protesters as ""fanatics,"" and The Sun's celebration of their role in stopping the protest. The key aspects of the protest itself must be covered, but not at the expense of losing the original's strongly negative editorial stance against the protesters."

The issue is that the photo that accompanies that section of the article is of the Magna Carta protest. The summarisation removed any information about the Magna Carta so the photo becomes incongruous. A mention of the Magna Carta action is needed in this paragraph. Be careful, however, with words like ""work"", which in the context implies artistic work, but the Magna Carta is a historical artefact, not an artwork, although important culturally."

The original article presents a sympathetic, humanizing portrait of Louise Lancaster through extensive quotes from her family members who describe her as ""unrelentingly kind,"" and as someone who ""listens more than she speaks"" and who struggled with the decision to inconvenience people. The family's perspective dominates the original, explaining her careful reasoning process, her previous attempts at conventional activism, and the personal costs she has endured. In contrast, the summary strips away almost all of this humanizing context and family perspective, instead leading with and emphasizing the judge's characterization of Lancaster and others as having ""crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic."" The summary focuses primarily on the disruption caused and the legal proceedings, while relegating the family's supportive view to just a brief mention in the subtitle. The key aspects of the protest itself must be covered, but not at the expense of losing changing the article's tone which is sympathetic, family-focused, and includes the personal story of why Lancaster felt compelled to act."
