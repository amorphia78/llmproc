    <p>Chris Packham has told a court he &#x27;selectively&#x27; supports Just Stop Oil at the trial of an activist who scaled a gantry above the M25.<br><br>The BBC broadcaster made the comments while giving evidence as a defence witness in the trial of Cambridge music student Cressida Gethin.<br><br>The 22-year-old activist scaled the motorway near Heathrow as part of a protest by the group on July 20, 2022. She denies one count of causing a public nuisance contrary to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022.<br><br>Mr Packham was among those stuck for four to five hours because of the disruption - a day after the UK&#x27;s hottest temperature of more than 40C had been recorded - as he travelled from Hampshire to Surrey.<br><br>He told Isleworth Crown Court he came to &#x27;sympathise&#x27; with the fact he was forced to think about climate change, whilst also be concerned that he would be late to the recordings of the BBC&#x27;s Inside Our Autistic Minds programme.<br><br>Under cross-examination by prosecutor Neil Griffin, he insisted his support for Just Stop Oil is selective and conditional.<br><br>The prosecutor asked: &#x27;You are not an independent witness, you support Just Stop Oil.&#x27;<br><br>Mr Packham replied: &#x27;I support some of their actions, selectively.&#x27;<br><br>The prosecutor continued: &#x27;You support them (Just Stop Oil), they love having you as a public figure?&#x27;<br><br>Mr Packham replied: &#x27;I selectively support things that they do. What they make of my support is up to them.<br><br>&#x27;I probably don&#x27;t support them in the way that they want.&#x27;<br><br>The prosecutor asked about a Just Stop Oil press release relating to the Channel 4 documentary Is It Time To Break the Law?, which Mr Packham presented.<br><br>He insisted the press release had been &#x27;inaccurate&#x27;, that he had not advocated breaking the law and the programme would not have aired under broadcasting rules if he had called for law-breaking.<br><br>The defendant, who represented herself, asked Mr Packham in her cross-examination: &#x27;What were you feeling (when you were stuck)?&#x27;<br><br>He replied: &#x27;Knowing I was going to be late initially was causing me some concern.</p>

    <p>&#x27;I don&#x27;t like to fail the teams that I work with, even simply by being late.<br><br>&#x27;Initially I felt very frustrated and then obviously I researched, on trying to navigate a quicker route, I discovered the reason was that protesters were active on the M25, and then I changed my thinking.<br><br>&#x27;(I thought) I might as well use this to reflect again on why I am being delayed. That is what I chose to do.<br><br>&#x27;I sat and contemplated the reason that might have motivated the protesters to take that action.<br><br>&#x27;I thought about whether that action was productive and what it was doing. I took it as an opportunity to reflect on the fact I was in a traffic system sufficiently fragile, even normal disturbance would cause significant delay.<br><br>&#x27;I reflected on the fact that I was sweating quite profusely, it was a day after the UK had recorded its highest ever temperature and two days previously the Government&#x27;s net zero plan had been declared illegal.<br><br>&#x27;I understood, I think, why protesters were taking their action.<br><br>&#x27;This led me to sympathise with the fact that I needed to be put in a position where I was forced to think about the gravity of the situation.<br><br>&#x27;Rather than sit and fret and sweat, I thought I would run through a process that would make the experience positive.&#x27;<br><br>Earlier on Wednesday, the defendant broke down in tears at points during cross-examination as she insisted she faced a &#x27;massive moral dilemma&#x27; by engaging in the protest.<br><br>The defendant, who has taken two years out of her studies, told the court she did not believe all lanes would end up closed and that she did not realise she was so close to Heathrow during the protest.<br><br>When asked whether she intended to cause &#x27;spectacular disruption&#x27;, she told the court she did not but soon &#x27;realised this was potentially a more effective protest than I thought it would be&#x27;.<br><br>She does not dispute scaling the gantry but denies that it amounts to the charge against her.<br><br>The trial continues.</p>

    <p>A group linked to Extinction Rebellion has forced the closure of 50 branches of Barclays Bank after activists superglued their doors shut.<br><br>Supporters of Money Rebellion, a “sister organisation” of XR, disabled the entrances of branches in Tottenham Court Road in London, Kilmarnock Road in Glasgow and Albion Street in Leeds.<br><br>Activists urged customers to boycott the company to exert pressure on Barclays to stop funding fossil fuel projects.<br><br>The bank has previously been targeted by Greenpeace, which claims it is the largest funder of fossil fuels in Europe. It has demanded the bank switch to supporting renewable energy projects.<br><br>A spokesman for Money Rebellion said the disruption was “part of a significant new wave of property-focused climate action. Climate change is real and happening now. We urge Barclays customers to use their power by moving their account to a bank more aligned with a liveable future for the planet.”<br><br>According to Bank.Green, which campaigns for banks to fund green projects, Barclays has invested $190.6 billion in fossil fuels in the seven years since the Paris agreement on climate change.<br><br>Barclays has previously said it will stop financing all oil sands and tar sands companies as well as new oil sands pipelines.<br><br>A Money Rebellion activist who took part in the action said: “Barclays are pumping billions into the fossil fuel industry, completely at odds with advice from the International Energy Agency, United Nations and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Barclays are choosing short-term profits over a liveable future and a lot of us are sick of the measly progress they’re making, as they hide behind their lies and greenwash.”</p>

    <p>An XR activist added: “We’re responding to public attitudes and targeting the perpetrators of climate breakdown, not ordinary people and we apologise for any inconvenience caused to staff and customers. The inconvenience we’ve caused this morning is small in comparison to the catastrophic events already happening due to Barclays’ financing of fossil fuels.”<br><br>A Barclays spokesperson said: “Aligned to our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, we believe we can make the greatest difference by working with our clients as they transition to a low-carbon business model, reducing their carbon-intensive activity whilst scaling low-carbon technologies, infrastructure and capacity.<br><br>“We have set 2030 targets to reduce the emissions we finance in five high-emitting sectors, including the energy sector, where we have achieved a 32 per cent reduction since 2020. In addition, to scale the needed technologies and infrastructure, we have provided £99 billion of green finance since 2018, and have a target to facilitate $1 trillion in sustainable and transition financing between 2023 and 2030.”</p>

    <p>Protestors stormed the 18th green during the final round of the Travelers Championship Sunday afternoon.<br><br>As Tom Kim stood on the final green with a chance to force a playoff against World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, with the pair poised to take their final putts on the 18th, the gripping finale of the PGA Tour&#x27;s final non-cut signature event took another twist.<br><br>A group of climate change protesters representing &#x27;Extinction Rebellion&#x27; slipped under the ropes, bypassed Cromwell police and stormed the putting surface in astonishing scenes.<br><br>The fairway invaders, who appeared to be wearing climate change messages on their t-shirts, tossed red, white and yellow powder at the golf course, with one even trampling through a greenside bunker.<br><br>The group of at least five were swiftly arrested by law enforcement on site and carted away. However, the destruction they left in their wake delayed the thrilling end to the tournament.<br><br>Tour officials were called to the green where groundskeepers waited with leaf blowers ready to be called into action.<br><br>Some of the intruders wore t-shirts with the message &#x27;No Golf On A Dead Planet&#x27; emblazoned across the front.<br><br>Police handcuffed at least five people, according to CBS play-by-play man Jim Nantz.<br><br>After they were escorted off the course, Scheffler left a potential 26-foot clincher from the fringe on the right edge of the cup, then tapped in for par.<br><br>If the delay heightened Kim&#x27;s nerves at all he didn&#x27;t show it. Following the greenside drama, the 22-year-old calmly stepped up and sank his birdie putt to tie the world&#x27;s top-ranked golfer and force a play off.<br><br>&#x27;It kind of took like the meaning of the putt kind of a way for a second,&#x27; Kim later told the media. &#x27;Because for the past 17 and a half holes all you&#x27;re thinking about is golf, and suddenly when that happens you&#x27;re almost not even playing golf anymore.<br><br>&#x27;I thought it was a dream for a second. The security guards were tackling people and people were getting arrested, it&#x27;s really hard to see nowadays.<br><br>&#x27;It took my mind off of the moment and [I] just kind of realized what was happening and obviously even though those people did something bad, you still don&#x27;t want them to get hurt. Obviously the police are trying to protect the players, I get it, but you still don&#x27;t want people to get hurt and I think it just kind of personally just took my mind away from golf a little bit and worried about something else.&#x27;<br><br>Scheffler eventually held his nerve in the playoff to prevail on a dramatic day over in Connecticut, marking his sixth win on the PGA Tour this year.</p>

    <p>He came out on top for the second time in three weeks, capturing the Memorial Tournament prior to last week&#x27;s struggles at the US Open.<br><br>&#x27;It was definitely a bit weird,&#x27; Scheffler said of the incident after hoisting the trophy. &#x27;I saw one person out of the corner of my eye, and then I saw about five police officers sprinting around. From my point of view, they got it taken care of pretty dang fast, and so we were very grateful for that.<br><br>&#x27;When something like that happens, you don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s happening, so it can kind of rattle you a little bit, just because there&#x27;s people running around the green and there&#x27;s police officers running around the green and you don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re peaceful, you don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, you have no idea what&#x27;s going on, so it can be a bit stressful.&#x27;<br><br>Scheffler shot 5-under 65 in the final round, but Kim&#x27;s 66 with a 10-foot birdie putt on the last hole forced the extra golf. On the last hole of regulation, Scheffler left his approach on the left fringe and two-putted from there.<br><br>Kim&#x27;s approach shot was within a couple of inches of the hole before rolling back before he converted the must-make putt to extend the tournament.<br><br>The duo played No. 18 again in the playoff, with Kim&#x27;s approach short and in a bunker. After blasting out, he couldn&#x27;t roll in a long par putt.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion released a statement shortly after Sunday&#x27;s protests at the Travelers Championship, insisting they were aiming to highlight the &#x27;worldwide danger of climate breakdown&#x27;.<br><br>They also pointed to Saturday&#x27;s events in Cromwell, where spectators at the tournament were struck by lightning amid a thunderstorm in the area.<br><br>&#x27;With this action, Extinction Rebellion is NOT protesting any individual or organization,&#x27; the statement reads. &#x27;Rather, the protest highlights the worldwide danger of climate breakdown.<br><br>&#x27;Case in point: the last 13 months were the hottest on record, with extreme weather events around the globe. The activists pointed out that natural disasters are already causing large-scale loss of human, animal, and plant life, as well as significant damage to infrastructure, property, and agriculture.<br><br>&#x27;Just yesterday, they noted, at least two fans were injured due to a lightning strike at the Travelers Championship. This was of course due to increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather conditions.&#x27;</p>

    <p>Greta Thunberg was arrested by the Metropolitan Police for &#x27;refusing to move&#x27; when told to by police officers during a protest against an oil and gas conference in central London, according to eyewitnesses.<br><br>The 20-year-old Swedish activist could be seen smiling as she was detained by officers and led to a waiting police van after joining a protest outside the Energy Intelligence Forum (EIF) - formerly the Oil and Money conference - at the Intercontinental Hotel Park Lane.<br><br>In footage shared on social media, officers could be seen frogmarching the campaigner to the van as other protesters were told to stand back. The Met Police said it had arrested 21 protesters today.<br><br>Fossil Free London, which organised the demo, told the PA news agency that Thunberg was arrested while linking arms and changing with other activists; she was reportedly taken to Wandsworth police station.<br><br>It&#x27;s the latest arrest for the campaigner, who rose to fame after she began &#x27;striking&#x27; from school in 2018 over what she said was inaction by world governments to tackle climate change.<br><br>She had earlier spoken outside the hotel as part of a protest organised by Fossil Free London against the EIF event, urging eco-activists to &#x27;reclaim the power&#x27; and hitting out at &#x27;spineless&#x27; politicians for failing to act on global warming.<br><br>The Met said it arrested 14 activists under section 14 of the Public Order Act to prevent &#x27;serious disruption&#x27; to the community; it did not name Thunberg.<br><br>Fossil Free London activists banged drums and chanted &#x27;oily, oily money, out, out, out&#x27; as they blocked the hotel entrance; members of Greenpeace later dramatically rappelled down the side of the building to unfurl a banner reading: &#x27;Make big oil pay.&#x27;<br><br>Speakers at the conference include COP28 President-delegate Dr Sultan Ahmed Al-Jaber, net zero minister Graham Stuart, former climate change minister Charles Hendry and senior figures from energy firms BP, Shell, Repsol and ExxonMobil.<br><br>Its agenda includes a discussion on whether the COP climate change gathering is &#x27;still relevant&#x27;.<br><br>Speaking at the guerilla protest prior to her arrest, Ms Thunberg said: &#x27;Behind these closed doors at the Oil and Money conference, spineless politicians are making deals and compromises with lobbyists from destructive industries - the fossil fuel industry.<br><br>&#x27;People all over the world are suffering and dying from the consequences of the climate crisis, caused by these industries, who we allow to meet with our politicians and have privileged access to.<br><br>&#x27;The world is drowning in fossil fuels. Our hopes and dreams and lives are being washed away by a flood of greenwashing and lies.<br><br>&#x27;The people in power are knowingly leading us to the edge of the precipice. They know very well the invaluable things they are sacrificing in order for them to continue squeezing out profits from a dying planet.<br><br>&#x27;We cannot let this continue. The elites of the Oil and Money conference, they have no intention of transition. Their plan is to continue this destructive search of profits.<br><br>&#x27;That is why we have to take direct action to stop this and to kick oily money out of politics. We have no other option but to put our bodies outside this conference and to physically disrupt.<br><br>&#x27;We have to do that every time. We have to continue showing them that they are not going to get away with this. This is only the beginning of this fight and we are going to stay and we are going to come back time and time again until we see real action.&#x27;<br><br>Thunberg added: &#x27;We cannot rely on politicians and the people in power to save us. They have proven time and time again that they always prioritise the fossil fuel industry and destructive industries above people, above their own citizens.<br><br>&#x27;We have to reclaim the power, and that is what we are doing today. We have to kick oily money out.&#x27;<br><br>Protesters outside the Intercontinental, some of whom brought banners associated with Extinction Rebellion, chanted and set off flares as they called for the conference to be &#x27;shut down&#x27;.<br><br>Some held up photographs that they said showed the effects of oil and gas drilling on communities around the world.<br><br>A white fence surrounded the hotel entrance keeping protesters out while police smuggled conference attendees through the crowd of chanting activists and a samba band.<br><br>Later in the morning, activists from Greenpeace abseiled down from the roof of the hotel to unfurl a banner reading &#x27;make big oil pay&#x27;, while a strong wind billowed the message and the protesters against the side of the building.<br><br>Maja Darlington, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, told the PA news agency: &#x27;Oil bosses are toasting each other in a luxury hotel and plotting how to make even larger profits, while millions struggle to rebuild after a summer of extreme weather.<br><br>&#x27;Big oil is profiting from humanity&#x27;s loss and those who have done the least to cause climate change are being forced to pay the price.&#x27;<br><br>Police said they were &#x27;working out&#x27; how to bring them down safely and arrest them &#x27;if appropriate&#x27;.<br><br>Fossil Free London says it is &#x27;blocking&#x27; the conference in protest at &#x27;climate criminals conspir(ing) over canapés&#x27;.<br><br>The action is part of a series of &#x27;action days&#x27; organised by the eco-group, which has carried out several protests across London in recent years.<br><br>It plans further action tomorrow, Thursday and Friday - including a &#x27;Festival of Resistance&#x27; gathering at Marble Arch on Thursday afternoon and a &#x27;Rave and Resist&#x27; after-party at the end of the week.<br><br>Director Robin Wells previously said: &#x27;The main purpose of protesting this forum is to make it clear that the industry is not welcome to come to our city, is not welcome to schmooze our politicians, is not welcome to profit at the expense of the collective survival and the health of the one home that we all share.&#x27;</p>

    <p>Met Police officers could be seen monitoring the protest in Park Lane on Tuesday morning.<br><br>The force said it arrested six people on suspicion of obstructing a highway after receiving reports of the protest at 7.18am on Tuesday.<br><br>It arrested 14 more protesters in the afternoon for breaching section 14 of the Public Order Act and a further one for criminal damage.<br><br>A spokesperson for the force said: &#x27;Officers have been on scene since this morning with a group of protesters in the road outside a hotel in Park Lane, W1.<br><br>&#x27;We have had continued discussions with the protesters and there have been interventions by officers to enable members of the public safe access in and out of the venue. Six people were arrested for obstruction of the highway.<br><br>&#x27;Officers on scene have kept this under constant review and at 1232 imposed conditions on the group under section 14 of the Public Order Act given to prevent serious disruption to the community, hotel and guests.<br><br>&#x27;Officers asked the protesters to move from the road onto the pavement, which would enable them to continue with their demonstration without breaching the conditions.<br><br>&#x27;A number of protesters failed to do so and we have now made a further 14 arrests for section 14 of the public order act and a further one for criminal damage. Officers remain on scene.&#x27;<br><br>The Energy Intelligence Forum says it is a &#x27;platform for fostering debate...and finding answers to the big questions facing the energy industry&#x27;.<br><br>Speakers at the conference include the CEOs of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Aramco and Norway&#x27;s Equinor, the German ambassador to the UK and Graham Stuart, UK energy security and net zero minister.<br><br>Mr Stuart has previously said that allowing oil and gas companies to continue drilling the North Sea for resources is necessary for energy security.<br><br>Discussions during the three-day event include whether the annual COP conferences are &#x27;still relevant&#x27; , &#x27;how far&#x27; renewable power can go, and whether net zero &#x27;will remain the standard&#x27;.<br><br>Tickets for the conference started at £3,650 per person - plus VAT.<br><br>A spokesperson for the Energy Intelligence Forum told MailOnline: &#x27;We recognize the protests at the Energy Intelligence Forum today, and believe this action reaffirms the need for constructive dialogue on climate change and the low-carbon transition.<br><br>&#x27;The Energy Intelligence Forum is a platform for discussing the biggest issues in energy, including the low-carbon transition.<br><br>&#x27;We believe the challenging process of reinventing the world&#x27;s energy system requires the cooperation and collaboration of all sides.<br><br>&#x27;We are committed to bringing together stakeholders in the energy system – governments, companies, finance, civil society, and academia – to discuss the best way forward for the world.<br><br>&#x27;The issue of climate change is being presented and discussed constructively throughout the conference.&#x27;<br><br>Fossil Free London has disrupted events such as BP&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting and an assembly of industry body UK Oil and Gas last year.<br><br>Meanwhile, Thunberg was fined by a Swedish court earlier this month for disobeying police during an environmental protest in July.<br><br>The Malmo District Court ordered her to pay a 2,250 kroner (£169) fine.<br><br>Ms Thunberg, who already had been fined for a similar offence, took part in a July 24 environmental protest at an oil terminal in Malmo, where activists temporarily blocked access to the facility by sitting down and were removed by police.<br><br>On September 15, she was charged with disobedience to law enforcement for refusing to obey police asking her to leave the scene. She then was dragged away by two uniformed officers.<br><br>Thunberg admitted to the facts but denied guilt, saying the fight against the fossil fuel industry was a form of self-defence due to the existential and global threat of the climate crisis.<br><br>After the verdict, she said: &#x27;We have the science on our side and we have morality on our side.<br><br>&#x27;Nothing in the world can change that and so it is. I am ready to act based on the conditions that exist and whether it leads to more sentences.&#x27;<br><br>On June 24, the same court fined her 2,500 kroner (£188) for refusing to obey police orders when taking part in a similar demonstration the previous month.<br><br>Earlier this year, Thunberg also pulled out of an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book Festival after accusing sponsors, investment firm Baillie Gifford, of &#x27;greenwashing&#x27;.<br><br>Tuesday&#x27;s action comes weeks after the UK government green-lit the controversial Rosebank oil field in the North Sea.<br><br>Around 350million barrels of oil are said to lie untapped in the oil field off the coast of the Shetland Islands, and Tories have hailed its approval as a means of reducing the UK&#x27;s reliance on Russian oil and gas - but opponents say the project amounts to &#x27;environmental vandalism&#x27;.<br><br>Lauren McDonald, a campaigner against Rosebank, said at Tuesday&#x27;s protest: &#x27;The only reason that they continue to pursue this is for profit, there is no justification for this.<br><br>&#x27;So as we head into another round of climate talks, we are demanding that Norway - that wealthy happy country that is powered by green energy at home - we are demanding that Norway stops putting the brakes on other countries&#x27; energy transitions.<br><br>&#x27;We are demanding that Norway stops profiteering while others around the world are struggling to pay their bills, struggling to live and struggling to survive in our destabilising climate.&#x27;</p>
