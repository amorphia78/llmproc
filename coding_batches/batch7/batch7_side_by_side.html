    <p>Chris Packham has told a court he &#x27;selectively&#x27; supports Just Stop Oil at the trial of an activist who scaled a gantry above the M25.<br><br>The BBC broadcaster made the comments while giving evidence as a defence witness in the trial of Cambridge music student Cressida Gethin.<br><br>The 22-year-old activist scaled the motorway near Heathrow as part of a protest by the group on July 20, 2022. She denies one count of causing a public nuisance contrary to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022.<br><br>Mr Packham was among those stuck for four to five hours because of the disruption - a day after the UK&#x27;s hottest temperature of more than 40C had been recorded - as he travelled from Hampshire to Surrey.<br><br>He told Isleworth Crown Court he came to &#x27;sympathise&#x27; with the fact he was forced to think about climate change, whilst also be concerned that he would be late to the recordings of the BBC&#x27;s Inside Our Autistic Minds programme.<br><br>Under cross-examination by prosecutor Neil Griffin, he insisted his support for Just Stop Oil is selective and conditional.<br><br>The prosecutor asked: &#x27;You are not an independent witness, you support Just Stop Oil.&#x27;<br><br>Mr Packham replied: &#x27;I support some of their actions, selectively.&#x27;<br><br>The prosecutor continued: &#x27;You support them (Just Stop Oil), they love having you as a public figure?&#x27;<br><br>Mr Packham replied: &#x27;I selectively support things that they do. What they make of my support is up to them.<br><br>&#x27;I probably don&#x27;t support them in the way that they want.&#x27;<br><br>The prosecutor asked about a Just Stop Oil press release relating to the Channel 4 documentary Is It Time To Break the Law?, which Mr Packham presented.<br><br>He insisted the press release had been &#x27;inaccurate&#x27;, that he had not advocated breaking the law and the programme would not have aired under broadcasting rules if he had called for law-breaking.<br><br>The defendant, who represented herself, asked Mr Packham in her cross-examination: &#x27;What were you feeling (when you were stuck)?&#x27;<br><br>He replied: &#x27;Knowing I was going to be late initially was causing me some concern.</p>

    <p>&#x27;I don&#x27;t like to fail the teams that I work with, even simply by being late.<br><br>&#x27;Initially I felt very frustrated and then obviously I researched, on trying to navigate a quicker route, I discovered the reason was that protesters were active on the M25, and then I changed my thinking.<br><br>&#x27;(I thought) I might as well use this to reflect again on why I am being delayed. That is what I chose to do.<br><br>&#x27;I sat and contemplated the reason that might have motivated the protesters to take that action.<br><br>&#x27;I thought about whether that action was productive and what it was doing. I took it as an opportunity to reflect on the fact I was in a traffic system sufficiently fragile, even normal disturbance would cause significant delay.<br><br>&#x27;I reflected on the fact that I was sweating quite profusely, it was a day after the UK had recorded its highest ever temperature and two days previously the Government&#x27;s net zero plan had been declared illegal.<br><br>&#x27;I understood, I think, why protesters were taking their action.<br><br>&#x27;This led me to sympathise with the fact that I needed to be put in a position where I was forced to think about the gravity of the situation.<br><br>&#x27;Rather than sit and fret and sweat, I thought I would run through a process that would make the experience positive.&#x27;<br><br>Earlier on Wednesday, the defendant broke down in tears at points during cross-examination as she insisted she faced a &#x27;massive moral dilemma&#x27; by engaging in the protest.<br><br>The defendant, who has taken two years out of her studies, told the court she did not believe all lanes would end up closed and that she did not realise she was so close to Heathrow during the protest.<br><br>When asked whether she intended to cause &#x27;spectacular disruption&#x27;, she told the court she did not but soon &#x27;realised this was potentially a more effective protest than I thought it would be&#x27;.<br><br>She does not dispute scaling the gantry but denies that it amounts to the charge against her.<br><br>The trial continues.</p>

    <p>Protestors stormed the 18th green during the final round of the Travelers Championship Sunday afternoon.<br><br>As Tom Kim stood on the final green with a chance to force a playoff against World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, with the pair poised to take their final putts on the 18th, the gripping finale of the PGA Tour&#x27;s final non-cut signature event took another twist.<br><br>A group of climate change protesters representing &#x27;Extinction Rebellion&#x27; slipped under the ropes, bypassed Cromwell police and stormed the putting surface in astonishing scenes.<br><br>The fairway invaders, who appeared to be wearing climate change messages on their t-shirts, tossed red, white and yellow powder at the golf course, with one even trampling through a greenside bunker.<br><br>The group of at least five were swiftly arrested by law enforcement on site and carted away. However, the destruction they left in their wake delayed the thrilling end to the tournament.<br><br>Tour officials were called to the green where groundskeepers waited with leaf blowers ready to be called into action.<br><br>Some of the intruders wore t-shirts with the message &#x27;No Golf On A Dead Planet&#x27; emblazoned across the front.<br><br>Police handcuffed at least five people, according to CBS play-by-play man Jim Nantz.<br><br>After they were escorted off the course, Scheffler left a potential 26-foot clincher from the fringe on the right edge of the cup, then tapped in for par.<br><br>If the delay heightened Kim&#x27;s nerves at all he didn&#x27;t show it. Following the greenside drama, the 22-year-old calmly stepped up and sank his birdie putt to tie the world&#x27;s top-ranked golfer and force a play off.<br><br>&#x27;It kind of took like the meaning of the putt kind of a way for a second,&#x27; Kim later told the media. &#x27;Because for the past 17 and a half holes all you&#x27;re thinking about is golf, and suddenly when that happens you&#x27;re almost not even playing golf anymore.<br><br>&#x27;I thought it was a dream for a second. The security guards were tackling people and people were getting arrested, it&#x27;s really hard to see nowadays.<br><br>&#x27;It took my mind off of the moment and [I] just kind of realized what was happening and obviously even though those people did something bad, you still don&#x27;t want them to get hurt. Obviously the police are trying to protect the players, I get it, but you still don&#x27;t want people to get hurt and I think it just kind of personally just took my mind away from golf a little bit and worried about something else.&#x27;<br><br>Scheffler eventually held his nerve in the playoff to prevail on a dramatic day over in Connecticut, marking his sixth win on the PGA Tour this year.</p>

    <p>He came out on top for the second time in three weeks, capturing the Memorial Tournament prior to last week&#x27;s struggles at the US Open.<br><br>&#x27;It was definitely a bit weird,&#x27; Scheffler said of the incident after hoisting the trophy. &#x27;I saw one person out of the corner of my eye, and then I saw about five police officers sprinting around. From my point of view, they got it taken care of pretty dang fast, and so we were very grateful for that.<br><br>&#x27;When something like that happens, you don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s happening, so it can kind of rattle you a little bit, just because there&#x27;s people running around the green and there&#x27;s police officers running around the green and you don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re peaceful, you don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, you have no idea what&#x27;s going on, so it can be a bit stressful.&#x27;<br><br>Scheffler shot 5-under 65 in the final round, but Kim&#x27;s 66 with a 10-foot birdie putt on the last hole forced the extra golf. On the last hole of regulation, Scheffler left his approach on the left fringe and two-putted from there.<br><br>Kim&#x27;s approach shot was within a couple of inches of the hole before rolling back before he converted the must-make putt to extend the tournament.<br><br>The duo played No. 18 again in the playoff, with Kim&#x27;s approach short and in a bunker. After blasting out, he couldn&#x27;t roll in a long par putt.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion released a statement shortly after Sunday&#x27;s protests at the Travelers Championship, insisting they were aiming to highlight the &#x27;worldwide danger of climate breakdown&#x27;.<br><br>They also pointed to Saturday&#x27;s events in Cromwell, where spectators at the tournament were struck by lightning amid a thunderstorm in the area.<br><br>&#x27;With this action, Extinction Rebellion is NOT protesting any individual or organization,&#x27; the statement reads. &#x27;Rather, the protest highlights the worldwide danger of climate breakdown.<br><br>&#x27;Case in point: the last 13 months were the hottest on record, with extreme weather events around the globe. The activists pointed out that natural disasters are already causing large-scale loss of human, animal, and plant life, as well as significant damage to infrastructure, property, and agriculture.<br><br>&#x27;Just yesterday, they noted, at least two fans were injured due to a lightning strike at the Travelers Championship.

    <p>Protestors stormed the 18th green during the final round of the Travelers Championship Sunday afternoon.<br><br>As Tom Kim stood on the final green with a chance to force a playoff against World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, with the pair poised to take their final putts on the 18th, the gripping finale of the PGA Tour&#x27;s final non-cut signature event took another twist.<br><br>A group of climate change protesters representing &#x27;Extinction Rebellion&#x27; slipped under the ropes, bypassed Cromwell police and stormed the putting surface in astonishing scenes.<br><br>The fairway invaders, who appeared to be wearing climate change messages on their t-shirts, tossed red, white and yellow powder at the golf course, with one even trampling through a greenside bunker.<br><br>The group of at least five were swiftly arrested by law enforcement on site and carted away. However, the destruction they left in their wake delayed the thrilling end to the tournament.<br><br>Tour officials were called to the green where groundskeepers waited with leaf blowers ready to be called into action.</p>

The activists pointed out that natural disasters are already causing large-scale loss of human, animal, and plant life, as well as significant damage to infrastructure, property, and agriculture.&#x27;</p>

The Met Police said it had arrested 21 protesters today.<br><br>Fossil Free London, which organised the demo, told the PA news agency that Thunberg was arrested while linking arms and changing with other activists; she was reportedly taken to Wandsworth police station.<br><br>It&#x27;s the latest arrest for the campaigner, who rose to fame after she began &#x27;striking&#x27; from school in 2018 over what she said was inaction by world governments to tackle climate change.<br><br>She had earlier spoken outside the hotel as part of a protest organised by Fossil Free London against the EIF event, urging eco-activists to &#x27;reclaim the power&#x27; and hitting out at &#x27;spineless&#x27; politicians for failing to act on global warming.<br><br>The Met said it arrested 14 activists under section 14 of the Public Order Act to prevent &#x27;serious disruption&#x27; to the community; it did not name Thunberg.<br><br>Fossil Free London activists banged drums and chanted &#x27;oily, oily money, out, out, out&#x27; as they blocked the hotel entrance; members of Greenpeace later dramatically rappelled down the side of the building to unfurl a banner reading: &#x27;Make big oil pay.&#x27;<br><br>Speakers at the conference include COP28 President-delegate Dr Sultan Ahmed Al-Jaber, net zero minister Graham Stuart, former climate change minister Charles Hendry and senior figures from energy firms BP, Shell, Repsol and ExxonMobil.<br><br>Its agenda includes a discussion on whether the COP climate change gathering is &#x27;still relevant&#x27;.<br><br>Speaking at the guerilla protest prior to her arrest, Ms Thunberg said: &#x27;Behind these closed doors at the Oil and Money conference, spineless politicians are making deals and compromises with lobbyists from destructive industries - the fossil fuel industry.<br><br>&#x27;People all over the world are suffering and dying from the consequences of the climate crisis, caused by these industries, who we allow to meet with our politicians and have privileged access to.<br><br>&#x27;The world is drowning in fossil fuels. Our hopes and dreams and lives are being washed away by a flood of greenwashing and lies.<br><br>&#x27;The people in power are knowingly leading us to the edge of the precipice. They know very well the invaluable things they are sacrificing in order for them to continue squeezing out profits from a dying planet.<br><br>&#x27;We cannot let this continue. The elites of the Oil and Money conference, they have no intention of transition. Their plan is to continue this destructive search of profits.<br><br>&#x27;That is why we have to take direct action to stop this and to kick oily money out of politics. We have no other option but to put our bodies outside this conference and to physically disrupt.<br><br>&#x27;We have to do that every time. We have to continue showing them that they are not going to get away with this. This is only the beginning of this fight and we are going to stay and we are going to come back time and time again until we see real action.&#x27;<br><br>Thunberg added: &#x27;We cannot rely on politicians and the people in power to save us. They have proven time and time again that they always prioritise the fossil fuel industry and destructive industries above people, above their own citizens.<br><br>&#x27;We have to reclaim the power, and that is what we are doing today. We have to kick oily money out.&#x27;<br><br>Protesters outside the Intercontinental, some of whom brought banners associated with Extinction Rebellion, chanted and set off flares as they called for the conference to be &#x27;shut down&#x27;.<br><br>Some held up photographs that they said showed the effects of oil and gas drilling on communities around the world.<br><br>A white fence surrounded the hotel entrance keeping protesters out while police smuggled conference attendees through the crowd of chanting activists and a samba band.<br><br>Later in the morning, activists from Greenpeace abseiled down from the roof of the hotel to unfurl a banner reading &#x27;make big oil pay&#x27;, while a strong wind billowed the message and the protesters against the side of the building.<br><br>Maja Darlington, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, told the PA news agency: &#x27;Oil bosses are toasting each other in a luxury hotel and plotting how to make even larger profits, while millions struggle to rebuild after a summer of extreme weather.<br><br>&#x27;Big oil is profiting from humanity&#x27;s loss and those who have done the least to cause climate change are being forced to pay the price.&#x27;<br><br>Police said they were &#x27;working out&#x27; how to bring them down safely and arrest them &#x27;if appropriate&#x27;.<br><br>Fossil Free London says it is &#x27;blocking&#x27; the conference in protest at &#x27;climate criminals conspir(ing) over canapés&#x27;.<br><br>The action is part of a series of &#x27;action days&#x27; organised by the eco-group, which has carried out several protests across London in recent years.<br><br>It plans further action tomorrow, Thursday and Friday - including a &#x27;Festival of Resistance&#x27; gathering at Marble Arch on Thursday afternoon and a &#x27;Rave and Resist&#x27; after-party at the end of the week.<br><br>Director Robin Wells previously said: &#x27;The main purpose of protesting this forum is to make it clear that the industry is not welcome to come to our city, is not welcome to schmooze our politicians, is not welcome to profit at the expense of the collective survival and the health of the one home that we all share.&#x27;</p>

    <p>Met Police officers could be seen monitoring the protest in Park Lane on Tuesday morning.<br><br>The force said it arrested six people on suspicion of obstructing a highway after receiving reports of the protest at 7.18am on Tuesday.<br><br>It arrested 14 more protesters in the afternoon for breaching section 14 of the Public Order Act and a further one for criminal damage.<br><br>A spokesperson for the force said: &#x27;Officers have been on scene since this morning with a group of protesters in the road outside a hotel in Park Lane, W1.<br><br>&#x27;We have had continued discussions with the protesters and there have been interventions by officers to enable members of the public safe access in and out of the venue. Six people were arrested for obstruction of the highway.<br><br>&#x27;Officers on scene have kept this under constant review and at 1232 imposed conditions on the group under section 14 of the Public Order Act given to prevent serious disruption to the community, hotel and guests.<br><br>&#x27;Officers asked the protesters to move from the road onto the pavement, which would enable them to continue with their demonstration without breaching the conditions.<br><br>&#x27;A number of protesters failed to do so and we have now made a further 14 arrests for section 14 of the public order act and a further one for criminal damage. Officers remain on scene.&#x27;<br><br>The Energy Intelligence Forum says it is a &#x27;platform for fostering debate...and finding answers to the big questions facing the energy industry&#x27;.<br><br>Speakers at the conference include the CEOs of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Aramco and Norway&#x27;s Equinor, the German ambassador to the UK and Graham Stuart, UK energy security and net zero minister.<br><br>Mr Stuart has previously said that allowing oil and gas companies to continue drilling the North Sea for resources is necessary for energy security.<br><br>Discussions during the three-day event include whether the annual COP conferences are &#x27;still relevant&#x27; , &#x27;how far&#x27; renewable power can go, and whether net zero &#x27;will remain the standard&#x27;.<br><br>Tickets for the conference started at £3,650 per person - plus VAT.<br><br>A spokesperson for the Energy Intelligence Forum told MailOnline: &#x27;We recognize the protests at the Energy Intelligence Forum today, and believe this action reaffirms the need for constructive dialogue on climate change and the low-carbon transition.<br><br>&#x27;The Energy Intelligence Forum is a platform for discussing the biggest issues in energy, including the low-carbon transition.<br><br>&#x27;We believe the challenging process of reinventing the world&#x27;s energy system requires the cooperation and collaboration of all sides.<br><br>&#x27;We are committed to bringing together stakeholders in the energy system – governments, companies, finance, civil society, and academia – to discuss the best way forward for the world.<br><br>&#x27;The issue of climate change is being presented and discussed constructively throughout the conference.&#x27;<br><br>Fossil Free London has disrupted events such as BP&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting and an assembly of industry body UK Oil and Gas last year.<br><br>Meanwhile, Thunberg was fined by a Swedish court earlier this month for disobeying police during an environmental protest in July.<br><br>The Malmo District Court ordered her to pay a 2,250 kroner (£169) fine.<br><br>Ms Thunberg, who already had been fined for a similar offence, took part in a July 24 environmental protest at an oil terminal in Malmo, where activists temporarily blocked access to the facility by sitting down and were removed by police.<br><br>On September 15, she was charged with disobedience to law enforcement for refusing to obey police asking her to leave the scene. She then was dragged away by two uniformed officers.<br><br>Thunberg admitted to the facts but denied guilt, saying the fight against the fossil fuel industry was a form of self-defence due to the existential and global threat of the climate crisis.<br><br>After the verdict, she said: &#x27;We have the science on our side and we have morality on our side.<br><br>&#x27;Nothing in the world can change that and so it is. I am ready to act based on the conditions that exist and whether it leads to more sentences.&#x27;<br><br>On June 24, the same court fined her 2,500 kroner (£188) for refusing to obey police orders when taking part in a similar demonstration the previous month.<br><br>Earlier this year, Thunberg also pulled out of an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book Festival after accusing sponsors, investment firm Baillie Gifford, of &#x27;greenwashing&#x27;.<br><br>Tuesday&#x27;s action comes weeks after the UK government green-lit the controversial Rosebank oil field in the North Sea.<br><br>Around 350million barrels of oil are said to lie untapped in the oil field off the coast of the Shetland Islands, and Tories have hailed its approval as a means of reducing the UK&#x27;s reliance on Russian oil and gas - but opponents say the project amounts to &#x27;environmental vandalism&#x27;.<br><br>Lauren McDonald, a campaigner against Rosebank, said at Tuesday&#x27;s protest: &#x27;The only reason that they continue to pursue this is for profit, there is no justification for this.<br><br>&#x27;So as we head into another round of climate talks, we are demanding that Norway - that wealthy happy country that is powered by green energy at home - we are demanding that Norway stops putting the brakes on other countries&#x27; energy transitions.<br><br>&#x27;We are demanding that Norway stops profiteering while others around the world are struggling to pay their bills, struggling to live and struggling to survive in our destabilising climate.&#x27;</p>

    <p>Shortly afterwards, however, Thunberg and some activists returned and were arrested again, this time for blocking a nearby traffic intersection, and led away to a waiting police van.<br><br>Prosecutor spokesman Vincent Veenman told AFP that currently no charges have been laid against the activists.<br><br>&#x27;This however may change if people are arrested over and over again for the same offence,&#x27; Veenman said.<br><br>Activists said that despite majority backing by the Dutch parliament as well as broad popular support to slash fossil fuel subsidies, &#x27;the plans will not be implemented before 2030, or even 2035&#x27;.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion posted on X: &#x27;Meanwhile the ecological crisis continues to rage and the country&#x27;s outgoing cabinet pretends that we have all the time in the world, while the crisis is now.&#x27;<br><br>The protest, added the environmental group, was part of a plan to pressure the Dutch government ahead of another planned debate about fossil subsidies in June.<br><br>A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said: &#x27;Greta joined the blockade yesterday as a European campaign to end fossil fuel subsidies was announced during the action.<br><br>&#x27;The international coalition United for Climate Justice is organizing actions and blockades throughout Europe in the near future with 30 movements from 15 countries.<br><br>&#x27;Yesterday there were actions and blockades on fossil subsidies in 10 countries across Europe and the number of actions will continue to increase.<br><br>&#x27;On May 4, we will join the blockade of XR Belgium with a few hundred Dutch rebels and on the same day there will be further actions and blockades throughout Europe. We must show the world that fossil fuel subsidies are at the heart of the global climate crisis, according to the IMF, global fossil fuel subsidies amount to $7 trillion.&#x27;</p>

      <figcaption align="center">The Rev Dr Sue Parfitt at her home in Bristol with Judy Bruce, rightADRIAN SHERRATT FOR THE SUNDAY TIMES</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>“Jesus was an activist, no doubt about it,” the Rev Dr Sue Parfitt says from a flowery armchair in her quaint cottage in Bristol. The octogenarian looks up to her mantelpiece at a wooden figure of Christ on the cross. “He broke the law continually and in the end was arrested and executed for it.” In the armchair opposite, Judy Bruce, 85, a retired biology teacher, smiles wryly.<br><br>A quiche may be warming in the oven, but Bruce and Parfitt aren’t here for a polite ladies’ lunch. A week ago they were arrested after the display case of Magna Carta at the British Library was chipped with a hammer and chisel. They held a banner that declared: “The government is breaking the law.” The act was carried out on behalf of Just Stop Oil (JSO). Bruce and Parfitt were both arrested and charged with £2,000 in criminal damage.<br><br>Since JSO was founded in 2022, its headline-grabbing stunts of civil disobedience — which it calls “actions” — have become a familiar sight. The climate group has managed to unite most of the country in irritation. Orange paint, soup and powder has been sprayed everywhere from snooker tournaments and art galleries to tennis matches and universities.<br><br>So why are two respectable elderly women, a reverend and a teacher, risking getting arrested in the name of the climate?<br><br>Over a cup of tea (with oat milk), and with Parfitt’s cats Holly and Mistletoe at their feet, the pair explain how they got into radical climate activism.<br><br>Parfitt, 82, was raised a Christian by conservative parents in south Wales. She read history at Bristol University and was briefly involved with the peace movement in the late 1960s but stopped because she feared being arrested at such a young age.<br><br>“It’s a different matter getting arrested in my eighties,” she says, matter-of-factly. “The point is to make the best use of your latter years. And what could be a better use than trying to save humanity from extinction?”<br><br>After stints as a nun and a family therapist, Parfitt married an Anglican priest and trained as one herself. When her husband died in 2013 she joined Christian Climate Action, which has since become the de facto Christian wing of Extinction Rebellion.<br><br>Bruce came to activism later in life, after retiring from teaching biology in a private school and moving to Swansea. She remembers always showing concern for things such as the ozone layer and GM crops, but became involved with Extinction Rebellion after her partner, who she says would have disapproved of her being arrested, died in 2020.<br><br>“When I first heard of doing actions that would end up with arrest, I thought, ‘Oh no. I don’t want to do that. Bad people do that!’ ” She was involved in a march during the G7 summit in Cornwall in 2021, but was motivated to break the law after “realising that non-arrestable ways of doing things are not making any impact at all”.</p>

    <p>They don’t exactly fit the classic profile of radical activists: Parfitt walks with a cane and Bruce is very slight, in a blue cardigan with pearl buttons. But both talk passionately about the climate crisis with a steely determination.<br><br>Bruce tells me she and Parfitt met “sitting in front of an oil tanker” in April 2022 and teamed up again at the suggestion of JSO when they unfurled a banner during a thanksgiving service at St Paul’s Cathedral that read: “Will our children thank us?”<br><br>“I think they had the idea that these two oldies might drum up some interest,” Parfitt says with a chuckle.<br><br>But they draw the line at some stunts. They turned down a suggestion to break the glass covering the Rokeby Venus painting in the National Gallery, chosen because it had been slashed by the suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914. (Two other JSO activists were arrested after it was vandalised in November and have pleaded not guilty to causing criminal damage.)<br><br>Parfitt’s background as a historian means she wants to ensure any painting or historical document will not be damaged. “There was no question there was any risk to Magna Carta, nor would we want there to be,” she says.<br><br>“We’re incredibly law-abiding citizens — believe it or not,” says Bruce.<br><br>Parfitt, still a practising Anglican priest, says the Church isn’t “terribly happy” about her involvement. “I have to report to my bishop every action I take,” she says.<br><br>Parfitt and Bruce know their actions rub people up the wrong way: they have lost friends and had fractious exchanges with family members. Bruce has been manhandled by a passerby. The two say they are vilified online and called “arthritic old codgers”, as Bruce puts it. “Well, I am arthritic,” Parfitt says with a laugh.<br><br>Both say the ageism they experience makes them feel sad rather than hurt. Parfitt says that as well as challenging perceptions of 80-year-olds, she wants to challenge their own age group too. “I often say to my friends, ‘Why don’t you come and do this, what have you got to lose?’. I don’t have grandchildren, but I say to people, ‘I’m doing this for your grandchildren’.”<br><br>But is it working? JSO floundered last year as its biggest donor, the green energy tycoon Dale Vince, announced he was cutting the cash supply, admitting that no amount of protesting would stop the government from North Sea drilling.<br><br>Are Bruce and Parfitt aware their actions may have alienated the public? They agree that climate activists can come across as preaching and self-righteous,“but in what other way is it possible to influence governmental action?” asks Bruce. “If we don’t do things that annoy people, it doesn’t get into the news.”</p>

    <p>Two Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists have been jailed for throwing soup over Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers painting after they came close to &quot;destroying&quot; the masterpiece.<br><br>Phoebe Plummer, 23 and Anna Holland, 22, were previously convicted of criminal damage after the contents of two tins of tomato soup were poured on to the priceless 1888 piece at the National Gallery in central London. They then glued their hands to the wall beneath it.<br><br>The pair caused £10,000 worth of damage to the gold-coloured frame of the glass-covered painting in the October 2022 attack. Plummer, from Clapham in south-west London, received a two-year jail term at Southwark Crown Court, while Holland, from Newcastle, was handed 20 months.<br><br>Staff at the gallery were worried the soup may have dripped through the protective glass and destroyed the painting, the court heard. It also heard that the damaged frame had been purchased by the gallery in 1999 and was valued at £28,000.</p>

After the first night in prison, he appeared by video link for a court appearance. He was bailed by the court, and should have been released. The student was held for a further three nights in a prison cell, according to testimony given to the Guardian.<br><br>“I consider that I was illegally imprisoned over the three nights of that weekend and will be taking a case of wrongful imprisonment,” the student said.<br><br>Another 19-year-old student who was arrested and also cannot be named for legal reasons, was held for 50 hours in a London police cell, from a Monday morning to Wednesday at 1pm.<br><br>She was charged under section 7 of the act after 24 hours in custody, but held for another day-and-a-half in custody before being taken to court.<br><br>“I remember asking for my medication, and I didn’t get it,” she said. “I asked multiple times. One of the officers said: ‘Why didn’t you have it with you?’ I said: ‘I didn’t expect to be held for 50 hours in a cell.’ And the officer said: ‘What, after what you have done?’<br><br>“Like I was a murderer or something, they just wanted me to feel bad.”<br><br>Jun Pang, a policy and campaigns officer for Liberty, said: “We all have the right to make our voices heard on the issues that matter to us.

    <p>Scotland Yard said 630 arrests had been made of Just Stop Oil protesters since 30 October, and 328 people went on to be charged. The rest have been released on police bail.<br><br>JSO data shows at least 276 people have been charged: at least 125 were charged with blocking key national infrastructure under section 7 and 125 with the lesser offence of wilful obstruction of the highway.<br><br>Sign up to Down to Earth<br><br>The planet&#x27;s most important stories. Get all the week&#x27;s environment news - the good, the bad and the essential<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>Just Stop Oil said: “They’re imprisoning peaceful protesters, protecting the real criminals, and licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects while everything burns.”<br><br>The widespread use of section 7 appears to have taken its toll on Just Stop Oil’s latest campaign of protest. On Wednesday, just half a dozen people turned up at Trafalgar Square, with only three wearing orange bibs with the group’s insignia. A couple of police officers hovered nearby.<br><br>Asked why they thought so few had come, one demonstrator said: “Everyone’s been arrested, everyone’s got court.”<br><br>Rachel Payne, 73, said she had already been jailed for her part in Just Stop Oil’s campaign during last year’s Cop27 climate talks.<br><br>She said the law had narrowed down what they were able to do as protest. “Last week, I saw them [protesters] get to the top of Whitehall and as soon as they put their feet on the road swarms of police just arrested them – two days running.<br><br>“In this country it’s supposed to be a free country. [Facilitating] protest is supposed to be a duty of the police – to enable protest – and yet they [the protesters] were not even allowed to be there.”<br><br>A university lecturer who knows one of those arrested said he believed the use of section 7 for walking down a road was disproportionate for such a peaceful protest.<br><br>Graham Mann, a lecturer in atmospheric science at Leeds University, said: “My perspective from being a PhD student in the 90s and the urgency of the climate emergency then, the science is very, very clear and has been for a long time. The urgency to decarbonise to reduce emissions has become even greater. So I can understand young people taking these actions.”<br><br>A spokesperson for Climate Action Support Pathway, which provides advice to those considering taking action, said: “This was the first real test for these new section 7 powers, and it became quickly clear that the police were going to use them readily. We changed the emphasis of our advice to those considering taking part as a result because section 7 carries a higher maximum penalty of a year in prison, and people need to be making informed choices about whether they want to take action or not.”<br><br>Asked about the 19-year-old student held in a London prison, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We are looking into this matter.”<br><br>Scotland Yard said: “All of the decisions on whether to charge, bail or NFA [no further action] Just Stop Oil activists have all been made within the 24 hours. We are working with magistrates courts across London, and in some cases in other counties, to put the activists who have been charged before magistrates at the earliest opportunity. However, there is only a limited number of people who can be seen by magistrates each day so it is not always possible for them to appear on the day they are charged.”</p></td>

Just Stop Oil should be ashamed of their activists and they and anyone associated with them, including a certain Labour party donor, should issue a condemnation of this shameful act immediately.&#x27;<br><br>Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho added: &#x27;Labour&#x27;s faux outrage at the Stonehenge vandalism would carry a lot more weight if Just Stop Oil hadn&#x27;t also thanked Labour for enacting &#x27;their demands&#x27; in their press release today.<br><br>We must not allow Britain&#x27;s energy policy to be dictated by fanatics.&#x27;<br><br>Labour has accepted more than £5 million from Mr Vince, including £1 million after the election was called.<br><br>The green energy tycoon supported JSO from its foundation and donated at least £340,000 before cutting off the cash last October.<br><br>Sir Keir has previously come under fire for refusing to return any money donated by Mr Vince and has vehemently denied claims that the Ecotricity boss wields any influence over Labour policy.<br><br>Mr Vince said: &#x27;Since Rishi Sunak has asked me personally to comment, I will. I don&#x27;t support what JSO did today.&#x27;<br><br>But the close relationship with Mr Vince, who Sir Keir met just days before revealing a plan to block all new oil and gas licences in the North Sea last year – coupled with the party&#x27;s previous opposition to toughening up laws around disruptive protests – has left questions over whether Labour can be trusted to crack down on such behaviour.</p>

They said in a statement: “This is to allow us additional time to work with specialists and progress our inquiries.<br><br>&quot;A man in his 70s and a woman in her 20s were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, damaging an ancient monument and deterring a person from engaging in a lawful activity. It follows reports that an orange substance had been sprayed on some of the stones by two suspects. We also continue to work closely with English Heritage.”<br><br>English Heritage chief executive Dr Nick Merriman said this morning there does not appear to be “visible damage” to Stonehenge. Dr Merriman told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme: “It’s difficult to understand and we’re deeply saddened about this vandalism, but we’ve been really touched by the messages of sympathy and support we’ve had.</p>

    <p>“Our experts have already managed to clean the orange powder from the stones because we were really worried about what would happen if they got in contact with water. So far, there seems to be no visible damage. The site is open to the public again and for the solstice tomorrow.<br><br>“It’s vandalism to one of the world’s most celebrated ancient monuments. We wish people would channel their protests away from cultural heritage sites, museums and galleries because we feel that doesn’t actually help their cause, and causes huge upset and disruption to the operation of these important sites.”<br><br>In an earlier statement, a Just Stop Oil spokesperson explained: “The UK’s government in waiting has committed to enacting Just Stop Oil’s original demand of ‘no new oil and gas’. However, we all know this is not enough. Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything. That’s why Just Stop Oil is demanding that our next government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.<br><br>“Failure to commit to defending our communities will mean Just Stop Oil supporters, along with citizens from Austria, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland will join in resistance this summer, if their own Governments do not take meaningful action. Stone circles can be found in every part of Europe showing how we’ve always cooperated across vast distances – we’re building on that legacy.”</p></td>

    <p>&#x27;It is completely unacceptable to target MPs and elected officials at their home address and we will respond robustly to anyone who seeks to undermine our democratic values this way.&#x27;<br><br>In a follow-up, the MoS revealed how the activists had circulated a manual to help protesters track down politicians&#x27; homes.<br><br>The guide recommended studying photos of MPs clapping for carers during Covid for clues to their addresses.<br><br>It also said obtaining personal details of politicians&#x27; partners and children can help identify family homes.<br><br>The JSO manual, which was available via the group&#x27;s website, said targeting MPs might involve breaking windows, throwing paint, occupying the property with a banner or placard, letting off stink bombs and deflating car tyres.<br><br>At the time, JSO spokesman accused the MoS of getting &#x27;in a tizz&#x27; about &#x27;ordinary people taking the power back&#x27; and described their actions as &#x27;democracy in action.&#x27;<br><br>Pink-haired Plummer grew up in privilege, raised in a £4million family home near the King&#x27;s Road in Chelsea and privately educated at £45,000-a year St Mary&#x27;s School in Ascot, Berkshire, then £34,000-a-year Mander Portman Woodward College in Kensington, west London.<br><br>The top-class education helped her secure straight A* grades in chemistry, computer science and maths A-levels, winning a spot on a Manchester University computer science course - but she ended up reading social anthropology at SOAS University Of London.<br><br>She was last registered as living in a large house in Clapham, south London, owned by the Church of England as a private home for a priest and their family. It&#x27;s unclear why Plummer was living there.<br><br>Scotland Yard said a 22-year-old woman was arrested on March 6 on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle and sending a malicious communication.<br><br>A statement from the Met said: &#x27;This followed extensive inquiries by a specialist team of Metropolitan Police Service investigators following reports in a national newspaper.<br><br>&#x27;In this reporting activists from Just Stop Oil allegedly called on followers to target elected officials at their homes and places of work.&#x27;<br><br>MailOnline has contacted the Met Police for comment.</p>

The protesters, wearing Just Stop Oil T-shirts, threw two tins of Heinz tomato soup over the 1888 work in October 2022, before kneeling down in front of the painting and gluing their hands to the wall beneath it.<br><br>Staff at the gallery inspected the painting and frame for damage while the women were still attached to the wall, and were worried the soup may have dripped through the protective glass. The frame was purchased by the gallery in 1999, the court heard, and was valued at £28,000 before it suffered the estimated £10,000 worth of damage.</p></td>

    <p>The protester who ambushed Keir Starmer at the Labour Conference is an Extinction Rebellion eco-zealot who describes himself as &#x27;a little bit of a weird one&#x27;.<br><br>Yaz Ashmawi, 28, was seen tipping glitter over Sir Keir just before he prepared to give the speech of his career to his supporters.<br><br>The black confetti looked to have alarmed the politician as Ashmawi yelled incoherently: &#x27;We demand a people&#x27;s house. We are in crisis, we are in crisis. Our whole future is in jeopardy&#x27;.<br><br>He was taken out of the conference hall to a Merseyside Police van and arrested.<br><br>JSO also shared footage of the stage-invasion linking it to their demand that Sir Keir &#x27;commits to revoking the oil and gas licences granted by this zombie Tory government&#x27;.<br><br>Ashmawi - who has his own website - describes himself as an Extinction Rebellion strategist and has acted as their spokesman. He claims to be a physicist with a particular interest in the study of entropy.</p>

I didn&#x27;t even really know what was happening. But thankfully the cops were there and kept us safe, because that&#x27;s, you know, that&#x27;s just weird stuff.&quot;<br><br>It came after the tournament was also delayed on Saturday when three people were injured after lightning struck a tree close to the course.<br><br>The protest caused a delay to play of around five minutes. The tournament was later won by Scheffler in a play-off.<br><br>The world number one, who was himself arrested while driving during last month&#x27;s PGA Championship, praised the police response. He said officers &quot;got it taken care of pretty dang fast, and so we were very grateful for that&quot;.<br><br>Mr Scheffler added: &quot;When something like that happens, you don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s happening, so it can kind of rattle you a little bit.</p>

    <p>Extinction Rebellion activists stormed the 18th green during the final moments of the Travellers Championship in Connecticut, spraying smoke and powder. Six people were arrested, some wearing T-shirts with the slogan &quot;NO GOLF ON A DEAD PLANET&quot;.<br><br>The climate change protest disrupted the end of the PGA tournament as golfers Akshay Bhatia, Scottie Scheffler and Tom Kim were finishing their final round. Six protesters were tackled by police and arrested following the stunt on Sunday afternoon.<br><br>Bhatia said: &quot;I was scared for my life. I didn&#x27;t even really know what was happening. But thankfully the cops were there and kept us safe, because that&#x27;s, you know, that&#x27;s just weird stuff.&quot;<br><br>The protest caused a delay to play of around five minutes. The tournament was later won by Scheffler in a play-off.<br><br>The world number one praised the police response. He said officers &quot;got it taken care of pretty dang fast, and so we were very grateful for that&quot;.<br><br>Mr Scheffler added: &quot;When something like that happens, you don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s happening, so it can kind of rattle you a little bit. That can be a stressful situation, and you would hate for the tournament to end on something weird happening because of a situation like that.&quot;</p>

    <p>Shut the System says its supporters carried out actions at offices of JP Morgan Chase, Allianz and Barclaycard<br><br>The City of London police are investigating claims by environmental activists to have carried out acts of sabotage on the offices of major insurers and financial institutions.<br><br>Activist group Shut the System said its supporters had cut cables and glued electrical service cabinets at JP Morgan Chase and Allianz, in what it described as the start of “a period of sustained sabotage” against fossil fuel finance.<br><br>The group also claimed to have targeted the Northampton HQ of Barclaycard, saying its activists had cut the 5G cable to the communications mast serving the building.<br><br>Shut the System distributed photographs purporting to show its supporters carrying out the actions. Northampton police said they had not received any report of vandalism.<br><br>Supt Jo Cash of the City of London police, said: “We are aware of a social media post by Shut the System, which alleges that criminal damage has been caused to infrastructure in the City of London.<br><br>“We have had no reports of any criminal activity at this time, but we’re speaking to those companies mentioned in the post and the wider business community. Inquiries are ongoing.”<br><br>Shut the System said it targeted JP Morgan because it was “ranked the world’s largest banking investor in fossil fuels”, while Barclays was targeted because it was Europe’s largest.<br><br>Allianz was targeted, according to Shut the System, because it is the sixth biggest insurer of fossil fuel projects and also insures Elbit Systems, the Israeli arms company. A Shut the System spokesperson said: “I am enraged by the financial sector’s continued support for deadly industries.<br><br>“‘Just doing our job’ wasn’t an excuse in world war 2 and it isn’t today. They have a choice of which industries they finance. I cannot bear to stand idly by while those in power continue to exacerbate global problems just so the wealthy few can make increased profits.</p>

    <p>The City of London police are investigating claims by environmental activists to have carried out acts of sabotage on the offices of major insurers and financial institutions.<br><br>Activist group Shut the System said its supporters had cut cables and glued electrical service cabinets at JP Morgan Chase and Allianz, in what it described as the start of &quot;a period of sustained sabotage&quot; against fossil fuel finance. The group also claimed to have targeted the Northampton HQ of Barclaycard, saying its activists had cut the 5G cable to the communications mast serving the building.<br><br>Shut the System distributed photographs purporting to show its supporters carrying out the actions. Northampton police said they had not received any report of vandalism.<br><br>Supt Jo Cash of the City of London police, said: &quot;We are aware of a social media post by Shut the System, which alleges that criminal damage has been caused to infrastructure in the City of London. We have had no reports of any criminal activity at this time, but we&#x27;re speaking to those companies mentioned in the post and the wider business community. Inquiries are ongoing.&quot;</p>

        <h1>Police fear Just Stop Oil jail sentences will spark more protests</h1><h2>The record term for Roger Hallam could serve as a ‘rallying call’, says the detective who led the investigation into his plot to bring the M25 to a standstill</h2><p>The record jail sentence for the co-founder of Just Stop Oil could serve as a “rallying call” to other climate activists for a wave of protests, police believe.<br><br>Roger Hallam, 58, was jailed for five years on Thursday for orchestrating protests that disrupted the M25 over four days in November 2022 when 45 protesters climbed gantries on various parts of the motorway, forcing police to stop traffic.<br><br>Daniel Shaw, 38, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, Louise Lancaster, 58, and Cressida Gethin, 22, were each given four years after being found guilty along with Hallam of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.<br><br>The sentences, handed down by Judge Christopher Hehir, are thought to be the longest ever given for peaceful protest and have been widely criticised.<br><br>The prime minister is facing calls to repeal the raft of anti-protest laws that were introduced by the Conservatives over the past two years.<br><br>Detective Inspector Chris Rudd, who led the investigation, said there were “certainly signals from the [activist] groups” that they intended to stage a protest in retaliation to the sentences.<br><br>He told The Times: “The judge commented upon sentencing that he hoped it may have some deterrent effect on others that wanted to cause serious disruption to members of the public. I do hope it does have some deterrent effect. But for some, it might be a rallying call.”<br><br>The five ­Just Stop Oil activists were recorded by an undercover reporter for The Sun during a Zoom call in which they discussed the planned ­protests and were aiming to recruit others.<br><br>They were sentenced under legislation introduced by the previous government to get tougher on disruptive tactics used by ­environmental protesters, including blocking roads and attacks on sporting events. A United Nations human rights commissioner condemned the measures as “deeply troubling” and “disproportionate”.<br><br>Rudd, who oversees most environmental protests in London, said the protesters were known to police before the covert recording. “There is mention of this being a simple Zoom call resulting in people ending up in prison for five years, but to be absolutely clear: the call contained compelling evidence of them engaging in a plan to conduct what is criminal activity. They wanted to cause absolute gridlock and chaos.”<br><br>During the trial, Metropolitan Police officers were stationed at court to deal with disruption from the defendants.</p><p>Rudd said less than 10 per cent of Just Stop Oil activists who appear in court plead guilty, compared with about 50 per cent in groups such as Extinction Rebellion, whose members followed the “longstanding tradition” of protesters “taking [punishment] on the chin”.<br><br>He added: “Most [Just Stop Oil activists] will self-represent at trial, making the trial process much longer. And as we’ve seen recently, make the trial itself a protest ground.”<br><br>The court was told that the M25 protests delayed more than 700,000 vehicles and caused economic damage of £765,000, and the cost to the Met was more than £1.1 million.<br><br>Hallam and the others will not qualify for early release after 40 per cent of their time is served as the emergency scheme is only in place for 18 months and will expire before they qualify.<br><br>• Labour announces early release for 5,500 prisoners<br><br>Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the former justice secretary and lord chancellor, has said the sentences make him feel “very uncomfortable”.<br><br>He said: “I am not criticising the judge because I am sure the judge is going with whatever the sentencing guidelines are. But these are people who are not violent criminals.<br><br>“They cause enormous irritation to a large number of people. However, to be sentencing people to four and five years in prison for that is maybe an indication as to why the prisons are so full. Maybe prison was appropriate, I don’t dispute that — but for that length of time, I feel uncomfortable at that. But there can be an appeal.”<br><br>John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said: “Post Office destroys lives, water companies pollute our rivers, [the Criminal Cases Review Commission] leaves innocent people to rot in prison, Covid ministers’ incompetence costs thousands of lives, but nobody is punished. Stop traffic on M25 and get five years in prison. This is brutally unjust.”<br><br>Sir Robert Buckland, the former Tory justice secretary, said the sentences were “fully justified and entirely merited”.<br><br>He said: “I hope it sends a very clear message to self-appointed campaigners that they have to be held accountable for their actions as well, just like everyone else and they are not above the law. There is a silent majority who are fed up with random forms of protest that cause widespread disruption. We’re law-abiding people in this country who want to be protected.”</p></td>

    <p><br><br>Greenpeace activists from Mexico, Argentina, Norway, South Korea, Poland and the UK have been protesting against the Coco since 23 November, carrying out sorties in canoes launched from the Arctic Sunrise, a Greenpeace ship, to stop the Coco&#x27;s crew from deploying equipment.<br><br>The Metals Company sought an injunction in the Netherlands to force protesters to stay 500 metres from the Coco.

    <p>A spokesperson for the campaign said: “Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, a law drafted by the fossil fuel lobby, was introduced in April by Priti Patel, and covers ‘interference with the use or operation of key national infrastructure’.

Both activists were given community orders and sentenced to 300 hours of unpaid work between them at Sheffield Magistrates&#x27; Court.<br><br>District Judge Daniel Curtis said &quot;many people would be critical&quot; of his decision not to send the pair to prison, warning: &quot;If you continue to undertake actions that are unlawful – custody is not far away and is almost inevitable.&quot;</p>

    <p>Each defendant claimed they were not granted a fair trial after the judge, Christopher Hehir, ruled that evidence about the climate change could play no part in their defence. Although each was allowed to give their “political and philosophical beliefs” about the climate crisis.<br><br>“The views of any defendant – however sincerely held, and whether or not you agree with them – about manmade climate change, and what should or should not be done about it, are entirely irrelevant to the question of whether or not each is guilty or not guilty,” Hehir told jurors, and he prevented defendants from presenting to the court a 250-page bundle of evidence relating to the climate crisis.<br><br>The defendants were able to get the prosecution to agree to a list of “facts not in dispute” relating to the climate crisis, including that climate change represented an “existential threat to humanity”, that warming about 1.5C “risks catastrophic and irreversible consequences”, that in the previous 12 months the global temperature had averaged 1.63C above preindustrial temperatures, and that in November 2022 the UK government had opened a new round of licensing for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.<br><br>In his closing speech to jurors, made from the dock, Hallam said: “There is good grounds as to quote a phrase from the prosecution because it is blindingly obvious to us here first that you have not been given all the evidence you need, [and] you have not been given the arguments on why you should hear the evidence.<br><br>“You cannot be sure of our guilt if you are not sure that you have not been given the evidence. That’s why I’m behind this screen, because I took my oath before God to tell you the truth, and we have received no good reason why we are not allowed to tell you what is blindingly obvious, namely what I’m not allowed to speak about.<br><br>“If you are not allowed to hear the blindingly obvious then it’s not a fair trial is it?”</p></td>

    <p>But on the instructions of Judge Chris Hehir they were restricted in the evidence they could bring regarding their motivation for taking part in the protest and mentions of the climate crisis, and told they could not mount a defence of justification.<br><br>Nonetheless, in closing speeches to the jury, both Plummer, who represented herself, and Raj Chada, who represented Sarti, made reference to the unusual heat in the court, which had led Hehir to finish early on several days of the trial.<br><br>“The irony of that, courtrooms being so hot in May that the trial day ends early, is not lost on me,” Plummer told the jury. She went on: “It was not my intention to delay anyone. I don’t want to cause delay or disruption to anyone.<br><br>“I want to prevent the massive disruption to all of us, from flooded roads, homes, and fields, from heat that melts roads and runways and is already killing and displacing millions around the world. That was my intention.”<br><br>Hehir repeatedly interrupted Plummer’s closing speech, reminding her of his instructions, before finally ordering the jury to leave after she invited them to join her in a minute’s silence for the victims of climate breakdown.<br><br>In his final address to jurors, Hall also made reference to the climate crisis, saying: “Isn’t it more reckless to spend the final two to three years we have [left] to avoid climate breakdown signing petitions and politely protesting by the side of the road, because it’s preferable to our lawbreaking government?”<br><br>At that point he too was silenced by Hehir. The trio will be sentenced on 3 July. The maximum penalty is 12 months imprisonment, an unlimited fine or both.</p></td>

    <p>IT was an audacious plot – and The Sun’s victorious bid to stop it could have come straight from a Hollywood thriller.<br><br>There was a feared mob leader, an undercover operation, a dramatic arrest, then a tense courtroom showdown.<br><br>And on Thursday it came to an end in true blockbuster fashion, with record sentences handed down to the Just Stop Oil eco zealots who we had exposed over their November 2022 protest that brought the M25 to a standstill over four days.<br><br>At Southwark Crown Court in South London Judge Christopher Hehir sentenced the group’s “ideas man” Roger Hallam to five years in jail, while Daniel Shaw, 38, Louise Lancaster, 58, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, and Cressida Gethin, 22, each received four-year jail terms.<br><br>The story had begun almost two years ago when a concerned whistleblower from JSO contacted me, prompted by a genuine fear that lives were at stake.<br><br>Arrangements were made for me to infiltrate a closely guarded JSO meeting at which I listened in amazement and horror as plans were set out to bring the M25 to a halt.<br><br>It all tallied with what my source had told me: “We’re all so worried.<br><br>&quot;The plan is to block the M25 between now and 2023.<br><br>“It’ll be daily and go on for the rest of the year.”<br><br>Most chillingly the whistleblower added: “They’ve become a cult and they are putting lives at risk.”<br><br>Their words were later echoed by the trial judge as he sentenced the JSO ringleaders — or as they call themselves, the “Whole Truth Five”.<br><br>They arranged the one-hour meeting, only to be attended by trusted activists, and hosted by the people who were, I’m told, higher up in the group’s hierarchy.<br><br>It was to set in place plans to rally together as many people as possible so they could cause the “biggest disruption in British history”.<br><br>My source warned me: “They do get a bit suspicious.<br><br>&quot;Use a fake, weird eco name, like FlowerPower. They like naturey names.”<br><br>So that was my codename as I logged on to the call at 7pm on the dot, on November 2, 2022, with my webcam turned off and my microphone muted.<br><br>Strangely for a secret rendezvous, the meeting opened with Bob Marley’s Get Up, Stand Up blaring from the host’s speakers.<br><br>Around a dozen people on the web call nodded along, then a voice boomed out: “We need to squash the evil — and what that involves is closing motorways.<br><br>“It’s almost impossible to stop and causes massive disruption.”<br><br>Then a familiar face popped up on my laptop screen.<br><br>It was Hallam, a 58-year-old organic farmer who is credited with co-founding JSO and acting as its “spiritual leader”.<br><br>He was already known for his front and centre role with earlier eco groups Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain.<br><br>Fresh-faced activists were in thrall, as he had already spent time in jail for his antics.<br><br>In fact we can reveal how he told Document magazine in 2019: “I was in prison last November, and the embarrassing truth is that I had a fantastic time.<br><br>“Going to prison is a deeply emotional and spiritual experience because it exposes you to a different side of life and what it means to sacrifice yourself to a greater cause, and that is a powerful experience.<br><br>“You’re in the cell and you have three naps a day and read your books.<br><br>&quot;For British people, that’s a definition of paradise.<br><br>&quot;I don’t give a toss that the door’s locked or that the food’s not that great.<br><br>&quot;It’s just a rest as far as I’m concerned.”<br><br>The whistleblower’s words rang in my ears as I took in Hallam’s long grey hair and softly-spoken voice and I thought to myself: “He does seem a bit like a cult leader.”<br><br>Sitting in his ground-floor flat in South East London, he vowed: “This is not just another action, it’s potentially the most significant act of civil disobedience in decades.<br><br>“If it goes on for three or four days it is the biggest disruption in British history.”<br><br>This disruption is going to be even more showstopping<br><br>The plan was for protesters to climb the steel gantries over the M25, which would make police stop the traffic out of safety concerns.<br><br>Giggling, Hallam told followers: “We need to get on to the gantries — there’s thousands of them.”</p>

    <p>In his audience was Cambridge University student Cressida “Cressy” Gethin — also jailed this week — who said of an earlier M25 blockade: “To see four lanes of traffic gone was incredible.<br><br>“This disruption is going to be even more showstopping.”<br><br>Fellow defendants Shaw, a social worker, ex-teacher Lancaster and key activist Whittaker De Abreu all spoke on the call.<br><br>As soon as I logged off after the meeting it was clear the evidence I had obtained was damning.<br><br>The next morning I sent my recordings to the Metropolitan Police and National Highways, as the protest was due to start on the following Monday.<br><br>Cops arrested most of the ringleaders in pre-dawn raids and a High Court judge granted an emergency injunction to bar the protests.<br><br>That weekend police arrested Hallam, and the Met’s Territorial Support Group invited me to witness the execution of his warrant.<br><br>This is normal procedure by the police, who regularly invite journalists to attend raids, to ensure transparency in their work.<br><br>I saw cops smash down Hallam’s door and seize his laptops as evidence before he later handed himself in at his local police station.<br><br>In the end, the JSO mob climbed the gantries, but six police forces across the South East of England had created a ring of steel around London’s orbital motorway.<br><br>Specialist teams had been deployed the day before, and there were significantly fewer activists on the gantries than there would otherwise have been.<br><br>However it still caused mayhem, costing the Met more than £1.1million, with damage to the economy put at £765,000.<br><br>It caused people to miss cancer appointments, flights and funerals, and a cop was hurt in an accident.<br><br>Nearly two years later, I had to face Hallam and the four other plotters in court as I gave evidence in front of a jury.<br><br>I faced a grilling from the activists, with four of them representing themselves, and a barrister.<br><br>I was quizzed about my methods as a journalist in the packed courtroom.<br><br>When Hallam came to question me, he looked me in the eye and asked a series of questions that the judge ruled inappropriate.<br><br>“What were my views on climate change?” he demanded to know.<br><br>The defence barrister then asked: “Why had I not handed the videos to the police sooner?<br><br>“Did I care more about the story than the people?”<br><br>No, I told the jury.<br><br>I am a journalist, so of course I care about stories, but I care immensely about public safety, and I handed over the videos as quickly as I could.<br><br>The judge was quick to remind the courtroom I was not on trial.When my appearance was over, I sighed with relief.<br><br>The entire two-week trial was crammed with drama.<br><br>Hallam, Shaw, Lancaster and Gethin all had their bail revoked during the trial after they defied an order by the judge not to talk about climate change when addressing the jury.<br><br>Others were arrested for contempt for allegedly attempting to influence jurors trying the case, but proceedings have since been discontinued.<br><br>Judge Hehir said Hallam had been encouraging people on X to come to court with placards saying: “Juries deserve to hear the whole truth” and “Juries have the absolute right to acquit a defendant on their conscience”.<br><br>When passing sentence, the judge told the defendants: “The plain fact is that at some point you have crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic.<br><br>“Your fanaticism has made you heedless of the rights of your fellow citizens.”<br><br>The judge said Hallam was “at the very top of the tree as far as the conspiracy is concerned” and that the Zoom call was “compelling evidence”.<br><br>He added: “Had not Ms Howes and The Sun passed the recordings to the police I consider it likely that the disruption would have been greater than it was.”<br><br>When I heard the verdict I was elated — despite the concerns that I and most other people share about the future of the planet.<br><br>This was a simple case of breaking the law — and it was proven by the Crown.<br><br>And in turn, this vindicated The Sun’s reporting.</p>

        <h1>Retired priest speaks of ‘painful’ treatment by church over her climate protests</h1><p>The Rev Sue Parfitt has lost right to conduct religious ceremonies after her arrest at a Just Stop Oil demonstration<br><br>An 82-year-old retired priest has spoken of her pain at losing her right to conduct religious ceremonies because of her participation in Just Stop Oil protests.<br><br>The Rev Sue Parfitt was arrested in May after allegedly causing damage to the glass around Magna Carta at the British Library in London as part of a protest with the climate action group. She is still awaiting trial.<br><br>It is one of dozens of protests the retired priest has taken part in during the last few years for Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain.<br><br>After her arrest in May, she was told by the diocese of Bristol and the city’s bishop, Vivienne Faull, that she would be denied permission to officiate (PTO) because of the charges she is facing.<br><br>PTO is a licence granted by the Church of England, typically to retired priests or deacons, that allows them to conduct religious ceremonies. It has to be renewed every three years and renewal is usually only refused for severe wrongdoing.<br><br>Parfitt, who lives in Bristol, said she has been negotiating with the diocese for her PTO renewal since the start of 2023. She was subject to a safeguarding check that recommended she should be granted the permission.<br><br>“It’s painful – I would be foolish to deny it,” she said. “And the irony is it’s the 30th anniversary year of women being ordained as priests.”<br><br>Parfitt and Faull were among the first women to join the priesthood.<br><br>“I am very shocked, surprised and disappointed in [Faull’s] attitude. I, and everybody else, find it inexplicable, considering her strong lead on the climate.”<br><br>Faull has been a progressive voice on climate action in the church in recent years, with the diocese of Bristol declaring a climate emergency in 2019 and being the first diocese in the UK to commit to reach zero carbon emissions by 2030.<br><br>At the time, Faull said that “care for God’s creation is key to our Christian faith” and that the move would “send a strong message” that “we must all act now” to combat the climate crisis.</p>

    <p>Parfitt said that she believed the climate crisis was a “spiritual issue”, adding: “This is God’s creation, and we need to be doing all we can to save it. I don’t want to sound too pious, but it’s part of the sacrifice I’ve been called to make.”<br><br>She added: “I’m the first priest this has happened to, even as some other clergy have been in prison [for similar protests]. And of course, it stands as a threat to everyone else. It is a double punishment.”<br><br>Parfitt said “the biggest thing” was that she would never be able to preside over a eucharist again. “That is a big deal. But if it came to the point where [Faull] said to me: ‘You can have your licence back if you commit to never take any illegal action again,’ I wouldn’t agree to that.”<br><br>Sign up to Observed<br><br>Analysis and opinion on the week&#x27;s news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>Several Just Stop Oil campaigners have faced professional repercussions as a result of their protests. The Guardian reported in March that three GPs involved in climate activism were awaiting professional tribunals where they faced being potentially struck off.<br><br>In July, five Just Stop Oil activists were sentenced to four and five years in prison for planning a protest that would cause gridlock on the M25. The sentences are thought to be the longest ever given in the UK for nonviolent protest.<br><br>A spokesperson for the Bristol diocese confirmed that Parfitt’s PTO had originally run out on 31 December 2022, but that she “remains a clerk in holy orders”.<br><br>They said: “PTO is not being issued at this time based on the fact that Ms Parfitt is facing criminal charges in ongoing court proceedings.<br><br>“The diocese recognises everyone’s legal right to protest.

    <p>A memory card smuggled out of a Russian jail in a match box and a letter from Beatles icon Sir Paul McCartney to Vladimir Putin helped end an international scandal.<br><br>That might sound like a plot in a Hollywood movie, but it is actually the reason why British Greenpeace activists are not rotting in a Siberian prison.<br><br>In 2013 a group of 30 environmentalists from around the world, including five Brits, set their sights on a Russian oil company, Gazprom, that was about to start drilling in the Barents Sea.<br><br>Their plan was relatively simple, attach a pod to the side of the oil rig which they could protest from, not only would they halt production, they’d draw the world’s attention to the impact of fossil fuels and stop what they believed was an international oil rush in the Arctic.<br><br>But instead they were shot at by the Russian coastguard and caught up in a scandal after their ship was raided by gun-toting counter-terrorism soldiers and the entire crew arrested on piracy charges, jailed for two months with the threat of a further 15 years behind bars.<br><br>Now the dramatic inside story on how their environmental mission turned into a nightmare is being told for the first time in a new six part BBC Two series, On Thin Ice: Putin v Greenpeace, which starts on Sunday.<br><br>Using incredible unseen footage captured by the protestors and testimony from many involved, the series lifts the lid on what was really going on behind the headlines.<br><br>Ben Stewart, who was head of communications for Greenpeace at the time, was drunk and raving in a London nightclub when he received a panicked phone call from aboard their ship, the Arctic Sunrise.<br><br>The crew had been shot at trying to carry out their mission and were now under attack.<br><br>A helicopter carrying heavily armed and balaclava-clad Russian solders was attempting to land on their ship and they knew they were in serious danger.<br><br>While the crew had locked down as much of the ship as possible to hold off the attack, it was only a matter of time before they lost control and were cut off from the outside world.<br><br>Action co-ordinator Frank Hewetson, 58, who has been with Greenpeace for 30 years, managed to make a call before it was too late.<br><br>Ben said: “My phone started ringing and I looked at it, it had this 15-digit number that I didn&#x27;t recognise, it was like a barcode or something.<br><br>“I just heard Frank trying to convey information as quickly as he could. And he said, ‘there’s about 20 of them, they&#x27;re special forces, they were heavily armed’, you knew s**t was going down.<br><br>“He sounded deeply adrenalised, I was deeply drunk and sobered up very, very quickly.<br><br>“This was a gross overreaction by the Russians, but also what they&#x27;ve done is not legal.”<br><br>Ben felt guilty, just weeks previously he’d been set to go on the mission but had to pull out at the last minute.<br><br>He was replaced by 27-year-old Brit Alexandra Harris from Exeter, and it was her first protest for Greenpeace.<br><br>Not wanting to scare her parents, she’d told them she was going to the Artic to research polar bears.<br><br>Instead, she found herself at the centre of the drama.<br><br>Alexandra said: “It&#x27;s like finding yourself in the middle of a James Bond movie. I was terrified.<br><br>“I’ve never had a gun pointed at me before.<br><br>“We were all taken down to the bottom of the ship, put in the mess, they searched us to make sure that we didn&#x27;t have anything on us like mobile phones, footage, that kind of thing.&quot;<br><br>Little did they realise that former cameraman Phil Ball had recorded everything and managed to hide the camera in his pants before carefully stuffing the memory card in the sole of his boot.<br><br>Miraculously, even after being banged up behind bars, the Russians never discovered it.<br><br>And Phil managed to get the memory card smuggled out of prison hidden in a matchbox he gave to his interpreter.<br><br>For Brit Frank Hewetson, storming an oil rig in the middle of the sea was nothing new.</p>

    <p>The 58-year-old is banned from entering America and Greenland after staging multiple protests for Greenpeace against oil companies around the globe.<br><br>But this experience pushed him to the brink of a nervous breakdown as he struggled to cope behind bars, locked in the same cell with a double killer and the head of a Russian taser gang.<br><br>He said: “It was an incredibly daring mission. It needed to be done. But the plan, I think you could say, went to s**t!<br><br>“I felt a mixture of anxiety and guilt. I felt responsible for the entire action. I felt deep in my heart the enormity of all 30 of us being incarcerated.<br><br>“I had a very close shave with having a total nervous breakdown.<br><br>“We were only allowed out once a day to walk in this outdoor cell and you would shout out ‘sunrise’.<br><br>“And if you heard someone else shouting out sunrise, you could quickly, in those few minutes, try to discuss what was happening to you, then you were dragged off.<br><br>“I turned up one day for exercise and I heard someone whistling The Greatest Escape, I started whistling back and it was so cheesy but in a sense I can’t tell you how deeply emotional that was.<br><br>“I was dreaming of my own great escape moment but the reality was I was staring down 15 years in prison and it was brutal.”<br><br>Back in London, in the basement of the Greenpeace UK headquarters, which had become known as the “room of doom”, Ben realised he had to come up with another way of convincing Putin to let their team go home.<br><br>The group, known as the Arctic 30, were caught in a game of political football.<br><br>At the time Putin was facing growing civil rebellion and he couldn’t look weak.<br><br>And overseas, the race to conquer the Arctic oil fields was hotting up, Putin knew he couldn’t risk a rival getting there first so was going to use the Arctic 30 as an example not to test Russian dominance in the region.<br><br>So in a bizarre turn of events, Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney proved to be a deciding factor in saving the day.<br><br>Ben explained: “We were up against this huge monolith, the might of the Russian political and judicial system. It was Putin, and what did we have against him?<br><br>“We called up the Russian office and we said, ‘who is the most famous person in Russia that we could get to support this campaign?’, without missing a beat they said that Paul McCartney is the only person who can command media in Russia in the same way that Vladimir Putin can.<br><br>“And so it became the mission to try to get Paul McCartney.<br><br>“Holy f**king s**t, he said he&#x27;d do it. Paul McCartney is going to write to Vladimir Putin on behalf of the Arctic 30.<br><br>“And it just fucking exploded, it was everywhere in Russia.<br><br>“I think he had a really big impact because it was the only chance that we got to really tell the story of the Arctic 30, unimpeded and unedited.”<br><br>Sir Paul’s letter, which was publicised around the world, coupled with the smuggled footage of Russia’s illegal boarding of the Arctic Sunrise in international waters was enough to turn the tide.<br><br>The jailed activists saw their charges reduced from piracy to hooliganism and after just over two months behind bars, they were all freed.<br><br>Greenpeace took on Putin, but after all the drama, do they think they won?<br><br>Faiza Ouhlason, who was one of the Arctic 30 and still works for Greenpeace, believes the jury’s still out but hopes this series will shine a light on the issue.<br><br>She said: “If Greenpeace lost, it means we all have lost, but I&#x27;m quite hopeful. I hope a lot of people will look at this series, the sacrifices we have suffered.<br><br>“I’m still a climate activist because I fight for something I believe in and it&#x27;s worth it.<br><br>“I want to be able to look my son in the eyes, 20 years from now, and even if we didn’t succeed, tell him that at least I tried.”<br><br>On Thin Ice: Putin v Greenpeace starts on tomorrow, BBC Two at 9pm.</p>

    <p>Thirty years ago, more than 500 activists united to save a street – and their actions marked a major turning-point in the environmental movement<br><br>Walking through Leyton, in east London, you could easily miss Claremont Road. It is hardly a road at all, but a stubby little sidestreet between terrace houses that ends abruptly in a brick wall. But when it comes to the history of direct action, this could be one of the most significant sites in England. Thirty years ago, in November 1994, the scene here was very different: 700 police officers and bailiffs in riot gear marched into a significantly larger Claremont Road and waged battle against about 500 activists, who were dug in – some of them literally – against efforts to evict them.<br><br>The activists occupied rooftop towers, treehouses, underground bunkers and even secret tunnels. It took three days to get them all out. In retrospect, the “Battle of Claremont Road”, as it came to be known, was an almost unbelievable event. “I talk about the three C’s that underpin this type of activism: creativity, courage and cheek,” says campaigner Camilla Berens, who was there. “It set the template for the next 20 or 30 years of how to do responsible disruption.”<br><br>The reason for the battle, and the reason Claremont Road is now so short, lies behind that brick wall at its end: what is now the six-lane A12, also known as the M11 link road. The road had been planned since the 1960s, to connect east London to the north-east, but nothing happened for decades. In the interim, many of the condemned homes were vacated by residents and reoccupied by squatters and artists. (As a student, I squatted on Claremont Road for three years. I left in summer 1993.)<br><br>By the 1990s, the Conservative government was determined to make good on Margaret Thatcher’s promise to carry out “the biggest road-building programme since the Romans”. Resistance from locals and environmental groups was growing, though, against schemes such as the M3 extension at Twyford Down in Hampshire (which went ahead), and the proposed east London river crossing through Oxleas Wood, in south-east London (which did not).<br><br>“The M11 link road was effectively the Cinderella of the three,” says veteran cycling campaigner Roger Geffen. Unlike Twyford Down and Oxleas Wood, the M11 scheme went through a poor urban neighbourhood, rather than an area of natural beauty, “but in a way, that’s what made it interesting,” he says. It was destroying the environment by uprooting trees and prioritising cars, but it was also destroying a community. This was the era of the Criminal Justice Act, targeting illegal raves, squatters and Travellers, which also passed in November 1994. The poll tax riots of 1990 had been another landmark. The Claremont Road protests were a “a joined-up mix of social and environmental motivations”.<br><br>At the time, Geffen had just moved to London. “I didn’t have a green brain cell in my head,” he says, but he had just taken up cycling. Weaving through the traffic-clogged streets, he says, he realised: “What I was doing wasn’t crazy. I was overtaking a lot of people in little boxes, and that was far crazier than what I was doing.” He joined the London Cycling Campaign, which led him into anti-car activism.<br><br>By the early 90s, the Department for Transport had begun repossessing and demolishing houses along the route of the M11 link road. In 1994, Claremont Road was the last street standing. “We realised that we needed to make a big focus of it,” says Geffen.<br><br>“One of the first things we did was to barricade it and set up street furniture,” says John Drury, then a PhD student studying collective action. The street became something of a countercultural tourist attraction, with colourful murals and outdoor sculptures made of junk and a public cafe. Doug (not his real name), then an unemployed activist, says: “There was a real buzz, and it had a lot of energy, and everyone was really friendly, so I just started sticking around.”<br><br>As the inevitable showdown approached, preparations became more rushed. “We had to just throw everything at it,” says Geffen. Some protesters built wooden observation towers on top of their houses. “So we thought, OK, what happens if we build an absolutely huge tower?” This became “Dolly”, a scaffolding structure 30 metres (100ft) high, rising out of the rooftops. It was named after Dolly Watson, a 92-year-old former actor who had lived on Claremont Road her entire life, and was among the last of the residents to leave. She once told a reporter: “They’re not dirty hippy squatters, they’re the grandchildren I never had.”<br><br>Other ad-hoc battlements appeared: treehouses, connected to the houses across the street by webs of netting and walkways; roadblocks made out of cars and shopping trolleys filled with concrete. Some activists built underground bunkers in which to seal themselves – “very elaborate womb-like structures that involved lots of layers of mattresses, foam, metal and furniture,” Doug recalls. The idea was that whatever tool the police or bailiffs tried to use to get them out “would get gummed up”. The upper floors of several houses beneath the tower were knocked together to create a “rat run”, and the stairs up to them were removed, to make it harder for the police to reach the protesters.<br><br>Volunteers had been monitoring police compounds for signs of activity. The callout came on 27 November. “‘It’s the one, it’s the big eviction. Claremont is going to be taken,’” recalls Berens, a journalist who reported on the events for the Guardian. “I think the whole of alternative London turned up. There was a massive party the night before.”<br><br>The next morning, 28 November, an estimated 500 protesters were ready, remembers Neil Goodwin, who edited his colleague’s Mayyasa Al-Malazi’s footage of the siege: “The rooftops were packed; every bunker, every treehouse, on the nets, the landings, the walkways, up the tower – everyone was in situ.”<br><br>“The police turned up in the early afternoon,” recalls Mark Green (not his real name), another participant. “There were hundreds of them and they swarmed into the street in stormtrooper gear with batons raised. They were expecting a full-on riot. Instead they just found a bunch of hippies and local residents sitting around.” A sound system on the tower cranked up the Prodigy album Music for the Jilted Generation.<br><br>Things didn’t go as planned for the police. “They thought they were going to start by tackling the houses, and then they realised people had locked on to the road itself,” says Julia Guest, then an aspiring photographer. Activists had drilled holes into the asphalt, into which they had sunk lock-on bolts, which were covered over with sheets of metal with holes in them. The activists “lay down with their arms through the holes and locked their wrists on with handcuffs.”<br><br>The police and bailiffs brought in mechanical diggers, cherrypickers, ladders, hammers and crowbars; and every occupant made themselves as difficult as possible to remove. “I was in the loft at number 42, which I’d covered in corrugated iron and filled with tyres,” says Goodwin. “They had to prise us open, like a sardine tin.”</p>

    <p>When the bailiffs eventually broke through that evening, Goodwin attached himself to part of the scaffolding tower with a bicycle D-lock, the keys of which he had chucked into a pile of tyres. “The bailiff pokes his head in, shines his torch around and goes: ‘OK, we’ll do this tomorrow.’ So they left, and I’m like: ‘I’m gonna be sitting here all night.’ So I said to people: ‘Could you see if you can find some D-lock keys?’” Luckily, they were just teetering over the edge of a gap in the floorboards.<br><br>Everyone remembers being cold and hungry, especially the first night. Few people had warm clothes, let alone sleeping bags. “After it got dark, someone led me down through a loft to warm up a bit,” says Green. “We then went through a hole in a wall and exited through a wardrobe, which was surreal, into a room where people were watching themselves on the news on an old black-and-white portable TV.”<br><br>By the second day, about half the protesters had been evicted. But, says Geffen: “The police were puzzled that people who they thought they’d evicted kept reappearing. Eventually, they got a metal detector out.” They discovered the activists had built a tunnel out of oil drums, running underneath the back gardens and into one of the houses on the next road. Supplies and people had been going back and forth the whole time. “When they found the tunnel, everyone on the tower and all the roofs just laughed at them.”<br><br>The longer the protest went on, “the more brutal the police and bailiffs became”, says Berens. Green says he saw people shoved, grabbed and falling from heights (though no one was seriously injured). “It definitely felt like there was a political element to it.”<br><br>The protesters “had a very strong commitment to non-violence”, says Geffen. “We needed to be acting in accordance with the values that we wanted to speak for. If we’re talking about environmental sustainability and sharing this Earth, and working in community, then violence doesn’t form part of that.”<br><br>By the end of the second day, there was only one protester left: Doug. “I kept moving,” he says. “If you live on a scaffolding tower for a few days, you can get quite good at swinging around. And they didn’t really want to chase me around in a game of cat and mouse.” Doug’s persistence extended the protest by another full day. The police even brought in a “hostage negotiator” to try to coax him down. “He pretended he was my dad, and was just concerned for my welfare.” Doug was not swayed. “I grabbed some rope, a saw and a few planks of wood, and I used them to make myself what was basically a coffin, which I slept in.” The police finally got to him the next morning.<br><br>In the end, the police spent more than £1m evicting the protesters. The M11 link road still got built, of course. Nobody believed the campaign would stop it. “But what it did do,” says Drury, “was it turned the roads programme into a political thing. So, we won the moral argument, even if we didn’t win that battle.”<br><br>When Labour came into power in 1997, it cut the major road schemes inherited from the Tories from 150 to 37, and pledged to focus on public transport. It felt like a victory for the anti-car campaigners, but it did not last. By 2000, New Labour was committing at least £30bn to building and improving roads, and forecasting that another 2,500 miles of road would need to be built.<br><br>Several of the Claremont Road activists went straight on to form Reclaim the Streets in 1995, which performed guerrilla anti-car actions – such as blocking off public roads to hold impromptu “street parties” – across the UK and worldwide. It also paved the way for subsequent campaigns such as Plane Stupid, the Climate Action Camps, Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil.<br><br>The protest changed the lives of many of those who took part. “That was the day that I crossed the line,” says Berens. “Before that, I was a journalist looking in and reporting on it, but because it was such an impressive campaign, and the people were so amazing, I became a committed activist.”<br><br>“It impacted me quite profoundly,” says Guest. She became a documentary film-maker focusing on human rights in Israel, Palestine and Iraq.<br><br>Paul Morozzo, one of the key organisers alongside Geffen, is now a campaigner at Greenpeace. Drury is a professor of social psychology at Sussex university. Doug is a lawyer dealing with civic issues.<br><br>Green went on to design the famous Extinction Symbol, as used by Extinction Rebellion. He is less nostalgic about the event: “I found the overall experience cold, dirty and depressing,” he says. He doesn’t like to describe it as a “battle”. “That suggests an exchange of violence, whereas it was just a group of people passively occupying an area, with the only violence coming from the police.”<br><br>But like a battle, the event took its toll. As well as committed activists, the area and the protest attracted many people with drug and mental health problems, not to mention locals who were either uprooted or forced to live on the edge of a six-lane road. “I naively hoped it would be a spark for a wider and longer-lasting societal change,” says Green. “Instead, things have just got much worse since then than we could ever have imagined.”<br><br>Geffen received an MBE for services to cycling in 2015, and now heads Low Traffic Future. “What I’m now doing is still basically the same cause,” he says. “In the 1990s, transport, roads, cars were the central issue for the environmental movement, then we lost a lot of that momentum. Environmental campaigners have gone on to do some great things on energy … but transport is now the biggest-emitting sector of the UK economy, as well as being problematic in terms of air pollution, road safety, children’s ability to play in the streets and all the waste products of car culture.” He thinks the movement needs to focus again on transport.<br><br>Another action like Claremont Road is unthinkable now, given how far legislation has tightened against protest, public disorder and squatting.<br><br>“It breaks my heart,” says Guest, “because actions like that created a generation of people that have become acutely aware, and prepared to act on strong beliefs. That is, after all, the only way that anything that’s unjust gets changed. And if people are prevented from being able to freely connect with that sort of experience, then what sort of world is going to come next?”<br><br>This article was amended on 26 November 2024. Paul Morozzo is a campaigner at Greenpeace and not campaign director, as an earlier version said. Also, it was not Neil Goodwin who recorded footage of the siege, but Mayyasa Al-Malazi.</p>

    <p>Essex Police have now said that two women, aged 22 and 28, have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use of national infrastructure following the incident. It comes after the protesters targeted Stonehenge with orange powder paint which was condemned by Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer. The Prime Minister described it as a “disgraceful act of vandalism” while the Labour leader branded the group “pathetic”.<br><br>If you can’t see the poll, click here<br><br>Members of the public tried to intervene, struggling with the campaigners – named by the group as Rajan Naidu, 73, and Niamh Lynch, 21 – as they ran up to the ancient monument on Wednesday. Video footage posted on social media showed two people wearing white shirts with the slogan Just Stop Oil, approaching the stone circle with canisters and spraying orange powder paint.<br><br>Wiltshire Police said officers had attended the scene and arrested two people. A spokesman for the force said: “At around noon, we responded to a report that orange paint had been sprayed on some of the stones by two suspects.<br><br>“Officers attended the scene and arrested two people on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument. Our inquiries are ongoing, and we are working closely with English Heritage.” English Heritage said experts were assessing the “extent of the damage” on the stones. A spokeswoman said: “Orange powdered paint has been thrown at a number of the stones at Stonehenge. Obviously, this is extremely upsetting and our curators are investigating the extent of the damage. Stonehenge remains open to the public.”</p>

        <h1>Geldof and Colman urge Home Office to reconsider climate activist’s deportation</h1><p>Exclusive: Actors and musicians condemn ‘harsh deportation’ of  Dartford Crossing protester Marcus Decker<br><br>Leading actors and musicians including Bob Geldof, Olivia Colman and Emma Thompson are calling on the Home Office to reconsider the “harsh deportation” of a climate activist who is serving one of the longest prison sentences in modern British history for peaceful protest.<br><br>Along with the musicians Brian Eno and Jacob Collier, they are among about 600 artists who are urging James Cleverly to withdraw the deportation order issued to Marcus Decker.<br><br>Decker is serving a jail sentence of two years and seven months for a protest in which he climbed the Queen Elizabeth Bridge over the Dartford Crossing and unveiled a Just Stop Oil banner in October 2022.<br><br>Decker, who is German, was served a deportation order by the Home Office while in prison.<br><br>The actors spoke out as the British government was criticised this week by the UN special rapporteur on environmental defenders. Michel Forst said the severe crackdown on environmental protest was having a chilling effect on fundamental freedoms.<br><br>In their letter, the actors say: “We believe that punishing him [Decker] with deportation in addition to the 14 months he has already spent in prison is out of proportion to the crime committed and unconducive to the public good.”<br><br>They say the protest Decker created was peaceful, adding “no one was harmed” and that it lasted less than two days.<br><br>“Consider that just in January of this year police closed both the Dartford Crossing and the Dartford Tunnel due to dangerous weather conditions, causing substantial disruption. Such extreme weather will only become increasingly frequent with escalating climate change.<br><br>“It was to prevent horrific disruption and suffering that Marcus took part in this action.”<br><br>Their words echoed those of Forst, who said this week that climate activists were acting for the “benefit of us all” and must be protected.<br><br>More than 150,000 people have signed a petition against Decker’s deportation.</p>

    <p>The letter says: “We urge you to consider what it would look like to the rest of the world if the UK, which prides itself in leading on climate action, were to start deporting human rights defenders like Marcus.”<br><br>Decker’s partner, Holly Cullen-Davies, a musician, said he planned to fight his deportation through the courts once he had been released from prison. His release is expected soon.<br><br>Decker’s fellow protester Morgan Trowland, who was given a three-year jail term, was released in December.<br><br>“Deporting Marcus is the ultimate punishment not just for Marcus but for us his family. It comes on top of one of the longest jail sentences for a climate protester and is a double punishment,” said Cullen-Davies. “Marcus is staying really calm as he waits for his release; it is torture for all of us. He find the prospect of deportation impossible to bear or imagine. I don’t know what we will do if that happens.<br><br>“What I would say to the government, though, is you cannot deport dissent and you cannot deport the climate crisis.”<br><br>Cullen-Davies said she had had to give up most of her work to campaign against the deportation of her partner and was relying on donations from environmental campaigners to keep herself afloat financially.<br><br>Decker is unlikely to be deported immediately on his release as he has filed a legal challenge to the order.<br><br>The letter follows a similar appeal to the home secretary from hundreds of scientists including James Dyke, associate professor in Earth system science and the assistant director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, and Julia K Steinberger, professor of ecological economics at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.<br><br>Forst, the UN rapporteur under the Aarhus convention, is gathering evidence of what he said was the worrying clampdown on climate protesters and considering what further action to take. The UK government is a signatory to the legally binding treaty and could be found to be acting illegally once his investigations are completed.</p></td>

    <p>On Tuesday morning, Jess Knowles carried her 20-month-old son Rico out of her terraced Victorian home in southwest London in a mad rush, conscious that she probably could not waste a minute if she was to make it on time to her child’s hospital appointment.<br><br>The stay-at-home mum was greeted by a disastrous sight after she walked over to the driver’s side of her black Jeep Night Eagle, a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that she uses through her disabled father’s mobility allowance — two deflated tyres.<br><br>After initially fearing that the tyres had been slashed, Knowles, 36, found that the valve caps had been stuffed to make them deflate, one with sunflower seeds and the other with crushed shards of pasta — a simple yet effective foil that meant that she could not make her son’s appointment.<br><br>Knowles’s car was one of over 40 SUVs and sports cars on the narrow tree-lined streets of Sands End to be targeted on Monday night by the Tyre Extinguishers, a group of activists aiming to “make it impossible” for city dwellers to drive “polluting death machines”.<br><br>The group, which launched in 2021, is a decentralised movement, with instructions on how to deflate a tyre with something as small as a lentil available on their website along with leaflets to be placed on people’s cars to explain the action.<br><br>Activists under the banner of the Tyre Extinguishers, who have no affiliation with campaign groups such as Just Stop Oil or Extinction Rebellion, have been taking their war to SUVs all over the world, including countries as far afield as Romania, America and Australia.<br><br>CCTV obtained by The Times showed three men wearing baseball caps tinkering with tyre valves in Sands End on Monday night, with the whole operation lasting just under a minute for each car.<br><br>“It’s so bad. They said that they’d keep doing it unless you change your vehicle,” Knowles said. “I’m looking out the window at night just to see if they’re outside. I don’t want anyone near my vehicle. They could put the wrong thing in there, they could flatten it for all I know… They don’t know why people need a vehicle.”.<br><br>Knowles did not display her badge when she parks at home because she has a residency permit, leaving her a target in the eyes of the Tyre Extinguishers, who claim to not target mobility vehicles if they see a disabled badge.<br><br>The action comes as The Times has learnt that Just Stop Oil, which has not held a protest since early December, will be launching a new campaign to lobby Labour candidates to sign a pledge that they will resign if a Labour government signs new oil and gas contracts.<br><br>The move represents a significant step by the group to engage in electoral politics. The Times understands that it was in part prompted by a belief that JSO had effectively sounded the alarm around the impact of new oil and gas contracts and that the next step would be political engagement.<br><br>A source told The Times that it represents a “diversification of tactics” and that “there was still a place for cultural actions” such as protests at the National Gallery.<br><br>“It’s about people in their community and in their regions kind of trying to take the power back and exercise their own autonomy to political actors that don’t represent them,” a source said.<br><br>“Given it’s an election year, politicians have to emerge from their shells. They have to crawl out the cracks and holes under the floorboards so we’re going to take this opportunity to engage with them directly,” the source added.<br><br>This comes as Roger Hallam, the co-founder of XR, Insulate Britain and JSO, has called for the need for balance in the climate movement and for activists to begin preparing for societal collapse.<br><br>The change, which is motivated by his belief that climate change will no longer be stopped, is a significant departure from Hallam’s previous position on the importance of public disruption to enact change, an approach that made him the architect one of the most disruptive and radical protest movements in modern British history.<br><br>In his New Year address, he told his followers he was working on a “profoundly different framing” for 2024.<br><br>“It goes something like: ‘Look, the carbon regime has totally f***ed up so the climate crisis is now locked in. We don’t need to create massive social disruption because it’s going to happen anyway! The regime will collapse under the weight of its own contradictions. So, what next? We need to build the next civilisation and stop fascism from taking us to a terminal hell’. Bit long but you get the idea,” he said.<br><br>Hallam said that he would outline different aspects of a “balanced revolution” by working on ideas such as how to hold public assemblies, how to door-knock and how to stand in elections.<br><br>“The mission is to empower people to see the big picture — one that transcends the traditional categories of politics, economics, social connection, and spirituality in favour of a new fusion of confrontation and dialogue,” he said.</p>

    <p>This also comes as the Reverend Mark Coleman, a climate campaigner who has twice been jailed for participating in Insulate Britain and JSO actions, stands for election in the upcoming Rochdale by-election.<br><br>Gail Bradbrook, another co-founder of XR, told The Times that the climate protest movement was incredibly focused on “preparing for the collapse of civilisation” by creating local assemblies to make decisions for the best of their community.<br><br>Bradbrook said that XR’s announcement last year that it would move away from disruptive tactics such as roadblocks and smashing windows was partly adopted because the tactic was being done by JSO.<br><br>“We [the climate protest movement] have to be more like nature,” she said. “Nature has ecosystems. It has different creatures for different purposes and they come alive at different times for different seasons.”<br><br>However, some experts believe that JSO has not been successful in holding protests of note in recent months and that this stagnation could give way to a newer more radical group to grow out of it.<br><br>Dr Paul Stott, of the Policy Exchange think tank, said that JSO has had little momentum in recent months due to its members being embroiled in legal battles, leaving the group needing to reinvent itself after running out of activists.<br><br>Last year during JSO’s last wave of action, the Metropolitan Police arrested 630 protesters from October 30 to December 4, with JSO data showing at least 276 people charged, more than 120 of whom under section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, a new power that bans any action that “interferes with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure”. Some cases arising in 2023 are now being listed in the crown court in 2025.<br><br>On Monday, three trials are due to begin involving climate activists, including five XR protesters charged with criminal damage for breaking glass at JP Morgan’s European Headquarters in 2021, eight Insulate Britain campaigners charged with public nuisance for stopping traffic on the M25 in the same year, and five JSO activists charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance for occupying tunnels close to Grays Oil Terminal in 2022.<br><br>This comes before the Court of Appeal considering whether the protesters can argue as a defence their belief that the property owner would have consented to the damage caused if they had been fully aware of the impact of climate change. The case has been prompted by the attorney-general, Victoria Prentis KC, after a spate of acquittals of protesters who have defaced buildings.<br><br>“One of the problems they’ve had is they’ve had so many court cases and people being arrested, re-arrested and convicted. Once organisations get into that position it becomes tricky,” Stott said. “They’ve been tied up in prison support campaigns and that sort of prison support although it’s necessary to maintain the morale of the group and its prisoners and their families, it rather saps the energy out of the campaigns”.<br><br>“One thing Roger Hallam tends to do is start campaigns and those campaigns have a high profile,” he said. “Insulate Britain for example hadn’t achieved its aims but the campaign petered out and was replaced by Just Stop Oil. It is more likely that another organisation will be started this summer, will flare, have some success, and fade again”.<br><br>However, some in the wider climate movement believe that there is growing awareness that a polarising approach will not bear fruit in trying to prevent climate change and prepare for the impact it will have on the world.<br><br>Rupert Read, a former member of XR and a founder of the Climate Majority Project, said that the group, which aims to bring the public along with it has welcomed a significant number of people with backgrounds in XR, Insulate Britain and JSO on to its email lists.<br><br>“The climate movement is moving in the direction of understanding that engagement needs to be much wider and that the majority of people ultimately need to be onside for this to work. You can’t win by [being] endlessly polarising,” he told The Times.<br><br>“There’s always going to be space for civil disobedience and the situation that we’re in merits all kinds of approaches to be tried. But it is absolutely imperative that we get more and more people onside, that we depolarize, that we ensure that climate is not a culture war issue.”<br><br>“What we’re trying to do fits in with the change in XR strategy last year to a somewhat more moderate direction… there is a lot of people a lot of thoughtful people from XR who understand what’s going on and can smell the coffee… ultimately, you have to do something more than raise the alarm.”</p>

        <h1>Just Stop Oil activists jailed after M25 blocked</h1><p>Five environmental activists who aimed to &quot;create mass disruption&quot; have been jailed for their role in protests that caused widespread traffic disruption on the M25.<br><br>The Just Stop Oil campaigners climbed gantries on the motorway in November 2022, forcing police to stop the traffic, in an attempt to cause gridlock across southern England. People &quot;suffered hours of delay&quot; on 9 November 2022 as a result, Basildon Crown Court heard.<br><br>All the defendants, who pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to causing a public nuisance, received terms of between one year eight months and two years. The defendants were all either retired, students or recent graduates at the time, the court heard.<br><br>Judge Shane Collery KC noted that an accident happened near one gantry and it was &quot;fortunate more accidents did not occur&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s easy to be blasé and dismissive when it&#x27;s not your life that&#x27;s being disrupted,&quot; he said. He said the protesters &quot;considered you knew better than everyone else&quot;, and suggested an element may have been &quot;the day out and perhaps the excitement of a day&#x27;s action&quot;.</p>

    <p><br><br>Protests over four successive days in November 2022 closed parts of the motorway in Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire. The judge said the court &quot;accepts a conscientious motive may be a relevant consideration&quot;. However he said &quot;your actions were disproportionate to your aims&quot;.<br><br>He jailed George Simonson, 24, of Leeds, and 26-year-old Theresa Higginson of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, for two years. Paul Bell, 24, of Exeter, was jailed for one year and 10 months. Gaie Delap, 77, of Bristol, and Paul Sousek, 73, of Bude in Cornwall were jailed for one year and eight months. A sixth defendant, Daniel Johnson, 25, of Perth and Kinross in Scotland, was given a 21-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.</p></td>

    <p>Just Stop Oil activists are plotting to cause summer misery for thousands of holidaymakers. The environmental group plans to wreak havoc at airports here and across Europe from mid-June.<br><br>Protesters will halt flights by storming terminal buildings, glueing themselves to runways and clambering onto jets in tourist hotspots like Spain, Greece and Turkey. It means travellers will likely face agonising delays here – while those lucky enough to take off could be forced to wait hours on the runway on the other side.<br><br>Last night, MPs and travel experts accused the group of “shooting itself in the foot” by causing misery and risking lives. Our undercover reporter learned of the plot at a meeting attended by some 50 hardcore activists. Just Stop Oil’s so-called poster girl, Phoebe Plummer, was greeted by roars as she announced “disruption on a scale that has never been seen before”.<br><br>She added: “The most exciting part of this plan is that [it’s] going to be part of an international effort. Flights operate on such a tight schedule to control air traffic that with action being caused in cities all around the world we’re talking about radical, unignorable disruption.”<br><br>Privately educated Plummer, who grew up in London’s posh Chelsea, has been arrested for a string of disturbances that include throwing soup at a Vincent van Gogh painting in the National Gallery. The pink-haired 22-year-old spent time in prison last year and was re-arrested a ­fortnight ago for breaking her bail conditions by posting a letter through the door of Labour MP Emily Thornberry.<br><br>Plummer’s shouty speech continued: “It’s time to wake up and get real – no summer holiday is more important than food security, housing and the lives of your loved ones. Flying is also a symbol of the gross wealth inequality that’s plaguing our society and if we want to create change we need to adopt a more radical demand.”<br><br>Just Stop Oil will team up with Europe-based eco mob the A22 Network to stage protests at major international airports. Last year, protesters from member group Last Generation spray-painted a private jet orange and glued themselves to runways in Germany. It later emerged the anti-fossil fuel group Network netted over £400,000 from billionaire oil heiress Aileen Getty.<br><br>The plot was last night widely blasted as being a selfish own goal. Clive Wratten, of the Business Travel Association, said: “These planned protests are a blunt instrument that will alienate the people who can bring the change Just Stop Oil wants. The activists should work with British businesses to create meaningful solutions to our climate crisis.</p>

    <p>“They should join airlines and their supply industry in bringing forward sustainable fuels and best practices, and we urge protesters to reconsider chaos bringing progress to a standstill.”<br><br>Gary Johnson, Tory MP for Dartford, branded the strategy “dangerous” and “selfish”, adding: “The actions of Just Stop Oil are counterproductive and put people off their cause. Most people want to see the environment protected but militant, highly disruptive protests just anger those who are often just trying to enjoy a family holiday.”<br><br>One fed-up holidaymaker added: “After the last couple of years, everyone needs a break. If this goes ahead it will be an absolute kick in the teeth for families.”<br><br>Some 51% of us plan to travel abroad this summer and three in five have already booked, according to Post Office Travel Money. Some 940,000 flights left the UK in 2023 and aviation contributes over £22billion to the economy, Government figures show. The planned action comes after passengers were told to expect chaos in the coming months due to staff shortages in air traffic departments.<br><br>Just Stop Oil was founded in 2022 to try to halt all new oil, gas and coal licences in the UK. Its previous protests include halting traffic on busy roads, targeting an Ashes Test match at Lords and storming on stage during a performance of Les Miserables in the West End.<br><br>Justifying the group’s actions, a Just Stop Oil spokesman said: “In normal circumstances, the sort of activities you’ve outlined would be unacceptable. However, what is more unacceptable is the last 10 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, governments continue to allow more oil and gas drilling. The situation is an emergency and we have to start acting like it.”<br><br>But Home Secretary James Cleverly criticised Just Stop Oil’s “unacceptable guerrilla tactics”, adding: “Selfish, disruptive protesters who wreak havoc in people’s everyday lives must be stopped. We have given the police more powers to tackle criminals posing as protesters and are backing officers with the tools they need to prevent serious disruption and disorder. More than 600 protesters were arrested during Just Stop Oil’s latest campaign.”</p>

    <p>As a young woman, few things worried Louise Lancaster more than the idea of letting people down or doing something embarrassing. Having been one of the co-organisers of the protest that reduced parts of the M25 to gridlock over four days in November 2022, it seems that in later life she managed to overcome those challenges.<br><br>“For the woman I married to become the woman she is now, she’s had to go against the principles she was raised with,” says her former husband Tim Lancaster. “To get to the stage where she could face off a police officer and risk arrest … all of that was hard for her. Really hard. The fact she was going to inconvenience people was the most difficult part. She wouldn’t have done it if she’d been able to see another way.”<br><br>Together for 28 years until their amicable split last year, Tim, 57, who worked in IT, and Louise, 58, a special educational needs co-ordinator before her retirement two years ago, became involved in climate change activism in 2019. They joined marches, signed petitions and wrote to their local MP.<br><br>“For a while we thought people were noticing,” Tim says. “But Lou said to me, ‘Look, we did all of that and nothing changed — we have to do something else.’ Around 2020 she started to see non-violent direct action as a way of getting the government’s attention. “Lou studied maths at Oxford. She looks at data and she works things out. She thought about it very carefully.”<br><br>Handing down record sentences for non-violent protest earlier this month, Judge Christopher Hehir told the court that Louise and her co-conspirators, Roger Hallam, 58, Daniel Shaw, 38, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, and Cressida Gethin, 22, had “some time ago … crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic” before they attended a Zoom meeting in which they planned to recruit 45 volunteers to climb gantries over the M25.<br><br>The judge described the protest as causing “massive disruption”, including missed exams, funerals and cancer appointments. It allegedly cost the Met Police £1.1m and impacted around 700,000 vehicles, leaving the motorway “compromised” for more than 120 hours. Lancaster did not herself take part, but she had climbed a gantry on the M25 in an earlier protest in July 2022.<br><br>On the Zoom call, Hallam, the co-founder of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, said that they intended to cause “the biggest disruption in British modern history” in an effort to force the government to meet one of Just Stop Oil’s core demands: an end to new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.<br><br>In a decision that has provoked fierce debate, Hallam was jailed for five years for compromising to cause a public nuisance, while Louise, who paid more than £1,000 to rent the Airbnb where protesters stayed, and also bought climbing equipment, was sentenced to four, along with Shaw, Whittaker De Abreu and Gethin.<br><br>With Tim on our video call on Thursday night are the couple’s three grown-up children. Tristan, 27, is a software engineer; Verity, 25, is a midwife; and Theo, 19, is a medical student. They are bunched together, legs dangling off the edge of a single bed in the family home in the village of Grantchester, near Cambridge. Tim and Louise divorced in November but remain good friends.<br><br>“Whenever I think of my mum I think: unrelentingly kind,” Theo says. “In almost any situation she will put others first.”</p>

    <p>Tristan, Theo and Tim visited Louise in Bronzefield, a female prison that houses category-A prisoners in Surrey, on Monday afternoon. “I’d had an interview for a summer job and the first thing she asked was, ‘How did it go?’” Theo says. “With me being the youngest, she has always been very open about what might happen and took into account my thoughts. She cares about us — if we’d said, ‘Mum, don’t do it,’ she wouldn’t have taken part.”<br><br>Verity visited the previous Tuesday, two days before the sentencing on July 18, along with Louise’s worried elderly father, a retired art teacher with whom, Tim says, she has had some pretty fiery exchanges. “He said he felt her activism has ‘let the family down’.”<br><br>“I gave her a hug and then burst into tears,” Verity says. “Mum broke into a massive smile and said, ‘I’m going to be fine.’ She told me she’d been helping other women filling out forms and she was going to do some online courses and work on her pull-ups.” Her brothers fall about laughing at this. “It’s very not-Mum.”<br><br>“She expected that this might happen,” Tim explains, “and she prepared herself and everyone else for it.” Nonetheless the family was shocked at the length of the sentence. “To get a sentence that is way longer than you’d get for violent crime [the average UK sentence for violent crime is 21.6 months]. It feels terribly unjust.” The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 allows such harsher punishments to be imposed.<br><br>Under the Public Order Act 2023, provisions also came into effect earlier this year that give the police more power to clamp down on disruptive protests. Did they not wish that Louise had done something else? Lobbying parliament perhaps? Or chaining herself to railings? “She has — and it hasn’t been enough,” Tristan insists. “Big Oil has known for decades that burning fossil fuels is dangerous but has carried on regardless, and successive governments have done nothing to stop it.”<br><br>The family is not sure if there will be an appeal against the sentences, but so far a crowdfunder has raised £60,000 to pay for legal fees. The cost would be hundreds of thousands of pounds. Instead they are pinning their hopes on the new government looking at the law. “I never thought as an Englishman I’d ever see rules as draconian as this in my country,” Tim says. “But Lou is resigned to doing her time.”<br><br>Louise was initially struggled to get any vegan protein or exercise in prison. But speaking to her on Friday, Tim reported back that she had at last received some suitable food.<br><br>In the course of her activism, Louise has incurred fines of more than £20,000, which she will struggle to pay off. She’s been strip-searched, handcuffed face-down and the house has been raided more than once by police. The emotional cost to the family is high. “Johnny and I are getting married next summer, Mum’s gutted to miss it. Maybe she’ll get out with a tag and she can wear a long dress,” Verity says, a little too brightly.<br><br>Tim describes Louise as a sensitive soul, someone who “listens more than she speaks”. Could Louise be in so deep she can’t see the wood for the trees? Verity says not. “She knew what she was putting people through. And it was a big moral dilemma. Her position was that there is a much bigger disaster at stake — if we don’t act quickly — than people being late for school and work.”</p>

    <p>Just Stop Oil activists have halted a West End performance of Les Miserables by invading the stage.<br><br>During a performance of the song One Day More, which involves waving a red flag, a group of four protesters stormed the stage and unfurled their own Just Stop Oil flag instead, to widespread boos from the crowd.<br><br>The protesters then chained themselves to the stage with bicycle locks, prompting the performance to be halted for around 20 minutes as the cast were forced backstage and the audience were ushered outside.<br><br>Among the protesters was 23 year old community worker Hannah Taylor, who said: ‘The show starts with Jean Valjean stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister’s starving child. How long before we are all forced to steal loaves of bread?<br><br>Up Next<br><br>‘How long before there are riots on the streets? The show cannot go on. We are facing catastrophe. New oil and gas means crop failure, starvation and death. It is an act of war on the global south and an utter betrayal of young people.’<br><br>She added: ‘Rishi Sunak has just approved Rosebank, a new oil project in the north sea which will produce as much carbon as the annual emissions of the 28 lowest-income countries combined. It will lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths due to starvation as crops fail in the increasingly extreme weather conditions.’<br><br>‘Am I not, like Jean Valjean, justified in breaking the law to oppose this criminal government and its murderous policies? Ask yourself, will you, like the citizens of Paris in the play, stand by and watch, or will you stand up against our governments’ criminal plans and call for an end to new oil and gas?’<br><br>Also in attendance was 19-year-old student Poppy Bliss from, Nottingham, who said: ‘I am taking action with Just Stop Oil because I am absolutely terrified for my future. I don’t want to be disrupting people’s evenings out, but I have been left with no other choice.</p>

    <p>&quot;The general election has neither fixed our broken system nor addressed the urgent action needed to tackle the climate and nature emergency.<br><br>&quot;Aristocrats, oligarchs and corporate interests have infected and distorted our politics and media for their own benefit and at our expense.<br><br>By Julia Atherley<br><br>ECO zealots at Extinction Rebellion raked in £1.5million last year — but paid just £1,039 in tax.<br><br>The activists, famed for glueing themselves to buildings and blocking streets, revealed the bumper income in accounts for the company which funds its campaigns.<br><br>But Compassionate Revolution said its £1.486million costs and administration expenses meant it made a profit of just £27,784.<br><br>As a result, the company paid £1,039 in corporation tax, leaving it with a profit of £26,745 for the 12 months to the end of June 2023.<br><br>XR leader Gail Bradbrook, who once accused banks of &quot;wholesale tax-dodging&quot; after smashing the window of a branch in Stroud, Gloucs, signed off the accounts.<br><br>The group has also blockaded Amazon depots — accusing the company of stealing from the public by &quot;depriving governments of tax revenue&quot;.<br><br>The company handles XR&#x27;s income from donations, crowdfunding, NGOs and foundations.<br><br>It says it distributes the cash to help those protesting over the &quot;climate and ecological emergency&quot;.<br><br>Its income to June 2023 was less than the £1.6million it received in the previous year.<br><br>&quot;Our politics is failing us from top to bottom. It&#x27;s time for a democratic upgrade.<br><br>&quot;We demand better at all levels; from the head of state to local councils but our central demand is for a Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Climate and Ecological Justice, which is needed more urgently now than ever before.&quot;<br><br>However Windsor Great Park has been practising sustainable land use for hundreds of years.<br><br>And the Crown Estate has a commitment to hit Net Zero carbon emissions by 2030.</p>
