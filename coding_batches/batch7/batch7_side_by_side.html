    <p>&#x27;I don&#x27;t like to fail the teams that I work with, even simply by being late.<br><br>&#x27;Initially I felt very frustrated and then obviously I researched, on trying to navigate a quicker route, I discovered the reason was that protesters were active on the M25, and then I changed my thinking.<br><br>&#x27;(I thought) I might as well use this to reflect again on why I am being delayed. That is what I chose to do.<br><br>&#x27;I sat and contemplated the reason that might have motivated the protesters to take that action.<br><br>&#x27;I thought about whether that action was productive and what it was doing. I took it as an opportunity to reflect on the fact I was in a traffic system sufficiently fragile, even normal disturbance would cause significant delay.<br><br>&#x27;I reflected on the fact that I was sweating quite profusely, it was a day after the UK had recorded its highest ever temperature and two days previously the Government&#x27;s net zero plan had been declared illegal.<br><br>&#x27;I understood, I think, why protesters were taking their action.<br><br>&#x27;This led me to sympathise with the fact that I needed to be put in a position where I was forced to think about the gravity of the situation.<br><br>&#x27;Rather than sit and fret and sweat, I thought I would run through a process that would make the experience positive.&#x27;<br><br>Earlier on Wednesday, the defendant broke down in tears at points during cross-examination as she insisted she faced a &#x27;massive moral dilemma&#x27; by engaging in the protest.<br><br>The defendant, who has taken two years out of her studies, told the court she did not believe all lanes would end up closed and that she did not realise she was so close to Heathrow during the protest.<br><br>When asked whether she intended to cause &#x27;spectacular disruption&#x27;, she told the court she did not but soon &#x27;realised this was potentially a more effective protest than I thought it would be&#x27;.<br><br>She does not dispute scaling the gantry but denies that it amounts to the charge against her.<br><br>The trial continues.</p>

    <p>I was one of a group of Just Stop Oil activists given the longest-ever UK sentences for peaceful protest after blocking a motorway. Six months into my incarceration, this is what I have learned<br><br>Locked in a tiny metal box in a prison transport van rattling its way to HMP Bronzefield, in Middlesex, I felt at peace. I was on trial with four other Just Stop Oil protesters over the group’s non-violent direct action on the M25 motorway in 2022. The judge had told the jury to ignore evidence of the climate emergency, and we were not allowed to talk in depth about the climate breakdown when defending our actions. But we do not have the time to pretend the existential threat we face is not real. My sense of peace came from having an opportunity to speak out about the crisis during our trial.<br><br>When I arrived in the cell that night, hearing the key turn in the lock, I felt cut off from the world. I was being held on remand, there was still a week of the trial to go, and communication with my co-defendants was nearly impossible. The support we were receiving from the outside, however – messages of solidarity, articles and letters – was incredibly sustaining. One day, 11 people sat outside the court holding signs that read: “Jurors have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to their conscience.” They were arrested.<br><br>Being on trial while in jail can be rough. Each day, I was woken at 5.30am and given a few slices of toast, before being taken to a holding room with others from our group. We would then be put in a van for a two-hour journey to court, where we would again spend much of our time in concrete holding cells. They were long days. It usually took hours to get back to prison, and often we would miss dinner. Food was scant. It was hard to prepare for the trial: you’re not allowed to bring pens or paper with you, so I wrote my closing statement on the back of an envelope in blue crayon.<br><br>Sentencing day was tense. In his statement, the judge accused us of being fanatics who don’t care about the rights of our fellow citizens. These accusations are regularly thrown at us, but they can still take the wind out of you. There were times I had to lie on my cell floor until my heart stopped pounding. I had been acting out of love to bring attention to the threat to humanity and hold the government to account.<br><br>The judge had suggested we would be in prison for a long time, but that still didn’t prepare us for our sentences. Four of us were handed four-year terms for conspiracy to cause public nuisance, while the Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam got five. They were the longest sentences ever given to non-violent protesters in the UK. I had already been in jail for a few weeks that year because of my activism, and felt prepared for what was ahead of me. My family – at 58, I have three adult children – were supportive. Even so, the atmosphere felt very heavy. A UN rapporteur had attended our trial and said our sentences were “not acceptable in a democracy”. Signs like these make me hope that change is coming. But in the meantime, I had to return to HMP Bronzefield.<br><br>Walking on to a prison wing for the first time provokes anxiety. Sound echoes everywhere as there are only hard surfaces, and the noise can be deafening. You hear people in distress, trying to make themselves heard. You start on an induction wing, but within a week most people will be sharing a cramped concrete cell with a stranger.<br><br>Many women in HMP Bronzefield are on remand, awaiting trial or sentencing. The community is an ever-changing mix of people, only a minority of whom, counter to public perception, are accused of violent crime. There are people facing drug charges. Victims of substance abuse. People with complex mental health needs. Homeless people. People with outstanding asylum cases. People engaged in civil resistance. The list goes on.<br><br>Many of them will be found not guilty, but they still have to wait in jail for an indeterminate length of time, becoming increasingly anxious and with no news of a trial date. It is a brutal system. As I meet more women and hear their stories, I wonder: who is it helping to incarcerate non-violent, low-risk people before they are even tried?<br><br>Cells differ in size. Mine is like a box room. Others are smaller and can only fit a small chair between the bed and the wall. There are bunk beds. Cells usually have a monitor that acts as a basic TV and radio. There’s a toilet and sink in the corner, which is necessary as we’re locked in for about 15 hours a day. We are given two vacuum flasks, which we fill with hot water before we get locked in. There is a phone in the cell, which we pay to use. Showering, queueing for food, and exercise in a tiny yard are communal activities. Accessing anything online – from selecting your meals to buying phone credit, booking a visit or arranging to speak to a GP – is done through one digital kiosk shared by nearly 40 people.<br><br>My approach to jail is to have very low expectations from the start, to lessen frustration. This strategy proves useful, as for six weeks I have only two sets of clothes. My other clothes languish at reception while I wait for an appointment to collect them. This snail’s pace is common, and tough for people with urgent needs. Queueing for more than an hour a day to collect medication is not unusual, and often takes up people’s daily hour allocated for fresh air.<br><br>My cellmate, Sue, and I get along well. I’m lucky. I have not experienced any negativity about what I’m in for. I’ve found most people don’t care too much about why others are here, with the exception of offences against children. Sue and I have lived very different lives, but we share a concern for the wellbeing of other prisoners, and recognise we’re all in this together.<br><br>Today, I’m woken abruptly at 7.30am by the jangling of keys and loud voices by the kiosk outside our cell. Sue and I are unlocked at 8am, 30 minutes before work. We can get cornflakes and two slices of toast from the servery, though most people head straight to the hot-water tap to make coffee.<br><br>There is a clamour to the morning routine. Groggy chatter over cereal. Blaring music from the cells of prisoners no one dares to challenge. Shouting and bar-rattling from a group demanding to be let out to collect medication. Others appeal to officers for more paper in the kiosk to print out movement slips. We all need a movement slip to go anywhere in the prison. It looks like a shop receipt and is your passport through the multitude of locked gates between you and your appointment. No slip, and you stay locked in your cell.<br><br>Thankfully I have my slip, so after breakfast I’m released from my wing and join a group of prisoners flowing through another barred gate to emerge into a garden. It’s a brief moment of fresh air before we head into another stark building with windowless rooms and bars across every entrance.<br><br>I spot a friend and we line up for a fingerprint scan. I have found a job in a workshop, refurbishing old bicycles that go to charity. It can be stimulating to learn a skill, and practical tasks give you purpose. Other workspaces run similarly: there’s a cafe, a salon, an art centre, gardens and a cleaning academy.<br><br>At 11.45am, we head back to our wings for lunch, and are then locked in our cells. I am let out at 2pm, and once again head to work. Today our cells are searched for drugs. The officers take our extra flask and cup, and what they consider excess fruit. Sue is left with the job of reassembling our home.<br><br>When I get back I thank her and, deflated, we join the queue for dinner (served about 4-5pm), plastic plates in hand. Tensions can flare at queue times, especially after cell searches. Officers change so frequently that it’s often community-savvy inmates who step in. Today, my friend Kay talks down a pair of prisoners and prevents them from kicking off. She supports everyone with love and care and timely injections of humour.<br><br>Our hot meal is followed by our daily hour of fresh air. It’s warm outside; most people sit and vape and soak up the sun. Vape oil is a valuable commodity in the prison.<br><br>I walk round our yard with Anne. She’s depressed. After being released on probation last month, she missed an appointment with her probation officer because she was sick. She was recalled to prison and now has to complete her full sentence. Prison recall rates are shocking: a recent report found that for every 100 people released on licence from April to June 2024, 73 were recalled. Sometimes that’s due to administrative errors relating to tags, but many people don’t get the support they need to rebuild their lives on the outside. One woman I know who struggled with alcohol misuse was just told before she was released: “Try not to drink.”<br><br>When officers call us back inside, it’s like a starting gun is fired. Some rush to shower or grab flasks for hot water. Others conspire to stay out as long as possible, heralding a lot of shouting, arguing and the eventual slamming of everyone’s doors for the night. Then, to the relief of some but the misery of others, time, lots of time. It’s common to hear banging and shouting through the night.<br><br>There are many people here who shouldn’t be in a prison setting. They should be getting mental health or drug rehabilitation support. This is a destabilising environment for everyone, and particularly for them. Our whole prison system needs to change. There’s a new government in place, and James Timpson has been appointed as prisons minister. I hope he gives the whole system a radical rethink.<br><br>One of my priorities is to stay connected to what is happening across the UK and the world. In prison, without the internet and with scant access to newspapers – which are often censored – limited TV and radio channels are the only source of news. In a shared cell, if one person watches the TV or listens to the radio, you both do. The space is too tight.<br><br>Fortunately Sue and I both want to catch up on daily news. This week we are stunned by the killing of three children in Southport who were enjoying a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Both of us are parents, and our thoughts are with their anguished families and community. We watch the vigils in silence.<br><br>In the following days, we are sickened by the racially motivated hate riots whipped up by social media posts and exacerbated by irresponsible political rhetoric. Later, those arrested for violent assault and arson will be sentenced to an average of two years. The contrast between their sentences and my own feels grim and stark. Fellow prisoners tell me they are shocked by the discrepancy. One Saturday, I catch the Any Answers? phone-in on Radio 4. It is dominated by callers arguing for and against the contrast. The court response to the rioters does seem to wake more people up to how unfit for purpose our criminal justice system is.<br><br>In the meantime, I find myself craving connection to those I love – the absence of which is the biggest contrast with life outside. In prison, I feel like a layer of my being has been stripped from me.<br><br>One Friday, around 4pm, I’m in the dinner queue, waiting for an onion and tomato wrap, and talking with Pam. She’s on remand for actions in protest against the horrific situation in Gaza. She has been classified as a terrorist. This means she is restricted from outside contact and is struggling to be allowed phone calls, emails or visits. Not surprisingly, she feels isolated.<br><br>After dinner, I talk to Sue, who is distraught. She was not collected in time to make her 30-minute video call with her daughter and tiny granddaughter (video calls happen in a room on the other side of the prison, and prisoners have to be collected and escorted there). She is feeling the loss of connection acutely. Her frustration is compounded by news of yet another postponement of her trial. She’s on remand and highly likely to be found not guilty.<br><br>We wake up early with the sun streaming through the curtainless window. Saturday turns out to be a good day. Fresh air is even called twice. I go to chess club, run by a very good chess player on the outside. There are some stimulating activities offered here: students from a university are running sessions on philosophy.<br><br>I wouldn’t say I feel more “at home” now, but I’m more aware of how things work. Inside, I can feel joy at things, or get excited, but I don’t get the intensity of feeling that I would on the outside. It is like something – a crucial part of myself – has been left out there.<br><br>I have a knot in my stomach as I climb down from my bunk this morning. Things are again in flux. My pictures are no longer clinging to the wall with toothpaste. My clothes are rolled and stuffed into plastic bags. Books and toiletries are in my laundry bag. Today I am being transported to another prison, HMP Send in Surrey.</p>

    <p>I feel mixed emotions. I requested the move, was happy to be rejoining my co-defendants Cressie and Lucia, and expected a calmer environment. But Sue, my neighbour Rachel and the bike workshop have kept me going. We exchange homemade cards and tearful hugs. We inmates are regularly moved like pawns on a chess board. It’s difficult to settle. Inter-prison communication is discouraged and hard to set up, so most lose contact and just fish for snippets of news of old friends when new prisoners transfer.<br><br>After the concrete fortress of Bronzefield, HMP Send is a breath of fresh air – quieter, with more greenery. It is also a bit like going back in time. Everything is done on paper, the walls are painted with murals and there is a public address system that reminds me of a 70s holiday camp I stayed in when I was nine. My fellow newcomers and I are met by a helpful inmate Jenny, who explains how things work, then sends us on our way to the induction cells.<br><br>At 9am the next morning, Jenny is there again to give us a tour. When we enter the servery, I am suddenly hugged by Lucia, who spots me while working in the kitchen. A beautiful reunion. I give Cressie a hug later that day.<br><br>Sign up to Inside Saturday<br><br>The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine. Sign up to get the inside story from our top writers as well as all the must-read articles and columns, delivered to your inbox every weekend.<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>Conversation, connection and mutual support flow more easily here – and thankfully I have a cell to myself. At Bronzefield, many people are held while awaiting trial, and people are constantly coming in and out. At Send, people have already been sentenced. People’s reasons for being at Send are generally a taboo subject, but we sense we are on the same emotional journey: we feel the low mood and the dull ache of missed friends and family that never abates.<br><br>At lunch I sit next to Fran, also a recent transfer from Bronzefield. She valued the money she got from working there and was concerned she would struggle at Send. It may sound strange that prisoners are paid, but this has to be the case. Not everyone has people on the outside who can send in funds. Food is provided, but you need money to make phone calls, and wages are scant. You get paid anywhere between 50p and £3 for a two- to three-hour work session. A standard wage is £15 a week, and you can easily spend half your wages on calls. Most people will also need to buy toiletries and extra food provisions at the prison shop. Vapes are a common expense – vape oil costs £3 a box, and people often buy five boxes a week. The basic prison pillow is uncomfortable, and there’s an option to buy a better one.<br><br>Virtually everybody I speak to who wants to share their story has been a victim of domestic violence or other forms of violence. Most prisoners arrive carrying a lot of trauma. They have failed to get the support they need on the outside, and prison is used as a convenient way to lock them out of sight.<br><br>HMP Send feels like a community. It needs to. Many inmates are facing decades within these walls, a chilling thought that regularly hits me. I’ve been here just one month, and already I sense my world shrinking. Time and again I well up with tears of sadness, and sometimes outrage, at others’ stories. There are women incarcerated for up to a third of their lifetime despite being deemed no risk to the public.<br><br>There are things that occupy us here. There’s work in gardens or kitchens, vocational training, such as hairdressing, education at the Open University, peer support, clubs such as choir or crochet. There are mental health support programmes and gym facilities. The chaplaincy runs services and offers a range of support for all faiths.<br><br>It feels chillier now, so I’m happy to have been able to collect property brought in for me – things that were sent by friends and approved by prison staff: winter clothes, towels, a radio, an exercise mat and art materials.<br><br>At 8.30am, I go to work in the gardens, where we grow vegetables in polytunnels. It is refreshing to be outside, surrounded by trees. The morning shift finishes at 11.45am, and we return to our cells to be locked behind doors for the noon roll-call and lunch.<br><br>Meals here generally follow a four-week rotation. At breakfast, you can have a packet of cereal. Lunch will be a hot meal. Dinner is often cold, perhaps a salad with some beans or a vegan sausage roll. It’s an improvement on Bronzefield, where a lot of the food was frozen. We even thought the fruit might be frozen because it was so tasteless.<br><br>I miss the ordinary activities of everyday life. I value the prison parkrun every Saturday morning, which links with the national event. We do seven loops of the same circuit, within the walls.<br><br>After a run today, I speak with Dawn as we cool down. She is on a 20-year sentence for having killed someone in a moment of diminished responsibility (a legal term that refers to someone’s judgment being impaired due to “an abnormality of mental functioning”). These extenuating circumstances were not properly considered in court. She would love to appeal, but it is too expensive. The only way would be to sell her home and render her children homeless. The law favours the wealthy, people with enough money to pay their way through the system.<br><br>The result of the US election has made this feel like a particularly dark time for the environment and social justice. I’m sick to the core that someone who advocates “drill, baby, drill” has gained such power. I talk about the news with my co-defendants and friends in the garden. We feel deflated, but being together, sharing how we feel, lifts our spirits.<br><br>As weeks pass, I struggle to recall how long I’ve been in prison. I calculate it as just over 20 weeks. I’m not institutionalised, but I have got into a rhythm. The key factors in determining how manageable prison life is seem to be location, luck and whether you have “enhancement”, a status you can apply for, which grants you more privileges. Most prisoners aim for enhancement, but it can be hard to attain. I never bothered at Bronzefield, but once I knew I was moving to Send, I tried hard. At Send, your standard level only gives you three outside visitors a month. With enhanced, you could get four.<br><br>The enhanced wing at Send also gives prisoners better accommodation, and more time unlocked. People have been waiting years to get in. When I arrived it was suggested I apply immediately, and I was offered a place in five weeks. I didn’t take it. People had been waiting a long time, and it suggested to me that it was a case of “if the face fits”. It seems to be easier to be favoured if you’re white and middle class.<br><br>As the month draws to a close, I feel I’m coping well with my incarceration. Many people struggle: with unexpected lock-ins, the dehumanisation, and the anguish of separation from children, parents, friends. As I write, we’ve been locked in our cells for two hours, when we would usually be exercising and socialising. There has been a prisoner miscount and they are recounting us. Their mistake becomes our problem.<br><br>Over time, you learn to accept the things you cannot change and look for ways to make the most out of the things you can. Every morning, I get up early and exercise in my room, shower and dress for work, and then have breakfast while listening to the news on the radio. I pack the week with variety: I have choir on Monday morning, have joined schemes supporting mental health, and am a mentor for a programme supporting prisoners learning how to read.<br><br>Visits are my favourite times – those couple of hours connecting with friends and family are truly irreplaceable. I cherish the physical contact – hugs are allowed at the start and end. During a visit today, I sit in the booth next to Dawn. She speaks to her husband four times a day, and at visits they hold hands and play Scrabble, just like they did on the outside.<br><br>Not being there when there’s an emergency or a key event is one of the main things that makes you feel pretty grim in here. When my long sentence was revealed, I knew it meant I would miss my daughter’s wedding. Thankfully, that has been postponed. But in the intervening times there are events – Christmas, people’s birthdays – that you have to miss. These are moments that can’t be repeated.<br><br>I start preparing for Christmas inside. Some of us in the gardens are doing a secret Santa, and the staff have allowed us to make wreaths with vegetation and wire. Though we probably won’t be able to bring them back to our cells, they are at least brightening up the polytunnels.<br><br>Festive fare in prison is limited. The Christmas Eve menu has a mince pie option for dessert, and on the 25th, lunchtime’s vegan offering is a festive slice, roast potatoes and veg. Otherwise, the menu is exactly the same as usual. But I have a bar of dark chocolate I’ve been saving up for Christmas, bought from my last Bronzefield shop three months ago. You learn to ration yourself. I get involved with carol singing on 9 December. There’s a carol service on Christmas Eve, then no work for a week. New Year’s Eve will have a craft morning, a film afternoon and a quiz.<br><br>Last week I was moved to a different wing. I’m delighted that my new cell has a hot shower. I’m hoping to do some festive cooking, but in this wing the kitchen is only available for one hour a week.<br><br>We are told that the government has plans to improve the quality of meals for all HMP institutions. This month’s Inside Time, the national newspaper for prisoners, leads with an article entitled Don’t Say Cheese!, which explains that prison cheese is apparently 79% water, palm oil and modified starch, and cannot legally be called cheese. (In January, this will change – my cheese-eating friend assures me it tastes like real cheese.)<br><br>Christmas Day in prison is my worst day here yet. I feel glum. I have lined up a lot of phone calls with family, but that – phone calls being the highlight of Christmas – brings home the reality of my situation. Meanwhile, one of our activist friends, who, at 77 years old, was released on home detention before Christmas, has been sent back into prison. The reason? Her wrists were too small for an electronic tag.<br><br>The craft morning, hosted by the chaplaincy and outside volunteers, offers us primary school level art activities – without the use of scissors. It is a jolly distraction, though with respect to the hosts, it does feel like we prisoners are often talked down to, as if we’re stupid. This seems to tally with a wider attitude to prisoners among the general public – that we are a different category of human.<br><br>My time in prison, however, has shown me the opposite. In this artificial environment, populated by people from all walks of life, with many considered on the edges of society, or those who are disadvantaged or have fallen on hard times, I have had my eyes opened to different perspectives. Recently, a friend came to visit me. She was concerned I was being bullied. I reassured her that wasn’t the case. In fact, I have found more people in prison who accept me and recognise the need to work against climate breakdown and reform our systems than I have in my community outside these walls.<br><br>How much divides a prisoner from a member of the public? If we listen to the press, the two are worlds apart. Prisoners are bad people who need to be locked away. But prisoners are parents, children, friends, with hopes and dreams. They’re integral parts of families and wider communities. A prison sentence can shatter more lives than one. Most prisoners want to rebuild their lives; they just need support to do so. The question we need to ask is not “What have you done?” but “What has happened to you?” We need to be bold and compassionate, and transition to a system focused on rehabilitation rather than punishment. This can be provided in our communities, rather than our prisons.<br><br>Outside each of the cell doors in HMP Send is a motivational phrase on a small laminated piece of card. My door has this one: “The secret of change is to focus all your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new.” I pass it every day, and it’s this spirit of hope, resistance and belief in radical change that I’m carrying into the new year.<br><br>Some names have been changed.

    <p>I was one of a group of Just Stop Oil activists given the longest-ever UK sentences for peaceful protest after blocking a motorway. Six months into my incarceration, this is what I have learned<br><br>Locked in a tiny metal box in a prison transport van rattling its way to HMP Bronzefield, in Middlesex, I felt at peace. I was on trial with four other Just Stop Oil protesters over the group’s non-violent direct action on the M25 motorway in 2022. The judge had told the jury to ignore evidence of the climate emergency, and we were not allowed to talk in depth about the climate breakdown when defending our actions. But we do not have the time to pretend the existential threat we face is not real. My sense of peace came from having an opportunity to speak out about the crisis during our trial.<br><br>When I arrived in the cell that night, hearing the key turn in the lock, I felt cut off from the world. I was being held on remand, there was still a week of the trial to go, and communication with my co-defendants was nearly impossible. The support we were receiving from the outside, however – messages of solidarity, articles and letters – was incredibly sustaining. One day, 11 people sat outside the court holding signs that read: “Jurors have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to their conscience.” They were arrested.<br><br>Being on trial while in jail can be rough. Each day, I was woken at 5.30am and given a few slices of toast, before being taken to a holding room with others from our group. We would then be put in a van for a two-hour journey to court, where we would again spend much of our time in concrete holding cells. They were long days. It usually took hours to get back to prison, and often we would miss dinner. Food was scant. It was hard to prepare for the trial: you’re not allowed to bring pens or paper with you, so I wrote my closing statement on the back of an envelope in blue crayon.<br><br>Sentencing day was tense. In his statement, the judge accused us of being fanatics who don’t care about the rights of our fellow citizens. These accusations are regularly thrown at us, but they can still take the wind out of you. There were times I had to lie on my cell floor until my heart stopped pounding. I had been acting out of love to bring attention to the threat to humanity and hold the government to account.<br><br>The judge had suggested we would be in prison for a long time, but that still didn’t prepare us for our sentences. Four of us were handed four-year terms for conspiracy to cause public nuisance, while the Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam got five. They were the longest sentences ever given to non-violent protesters in the UK. I had already been in jail for a few weeks that year because of my activism, and felt prepared for what was ahead of me. My family – at 58, I have three adult children – were supportive. Even so, the atmosphere felt very heavy. A UN rapporteur had attended our trial and said our sentences were “not acceptable in a democracy”. Signs like these make me hope that change is coming. But in the meantime, I had to return to HMP Bronzefield.<br><br>Walking on to a prison wing for the first time provokes anxiety. Sound echoes everywhere as there are only hard surfaces, and the noise can be deafening. You hear people in distress, trying to make themselves heard. You start on an induction wing, but within a week most people will be sharing a cramped concrete cell with a stranger.<br><br>Many women in HMP Bronzefield are on remand, awaiting trial or sentencing. The community is an ever-changing mix of people, only a minority of whom, counter to public perception, are accused of violent crime. There are people facing drug charges. Victims of substance abuse. People with complex mental health needs. Homeless people. People with outstanding asylum cases. People engaged in civil resistance. The list goes on.<br><br>Many of them will be found not guilty, but they still have to wait in jail for an indeterminate length of time, becoming increasingly anxious and with no news of a trial date. It is a brutal system. As I meet more women and hear their stories, I wonder: who is it helping to incarcerate non-violent, low-risk people before they are even tried?<br><br>Cells differ in size. Mine is like a box room. Others are smaller and can only fit a small chair between the bed and the wall. There are bunk beds. Cells usually have a monitor that acts as a basic TV and radio. There’s a toilet and sink in the corner, which is necessary as we’re locked in for about 15 hours a day. We are given two vacuum flasks, which we fill with hot water before we get locked in. There is a phone in the cell, which we pay to use. Showering, queueing for food, and exercise in a tiny yard are communal activities. Accessing anything online – from selecting your meals to buying phone credit, booking a visit or arranging to speak to a GP – is done through one digital kiosk shared by nearly 40 people.<br><br>My approach to jail is to have very low expectations from the start, to lessen frustration. This strategy proves useful, as for six weeks I have only two sets of clothes. My other clothes languish at reception while I wait for an appointment to collect them. This snail’s pace is common, and tough for people with urgent needs. Queueing for more than an hour a day to collect medication is not unusual, and often takes up people’s daily hour allocated for fresh air.<br><br>My cellmate, Sue, and I get along well. I’m lucky. I have not experienced any negativity about what I’m in for. I’ve found most people don’t care too much about why others are here, with the exception of offences against children. Sue and I have lived very different lives, but we share a concern for the wellbeing of other prisoners, and recognise we’re all in this together.<br><br>Today, I’m woken abruptly at 7.30am by the jangling of keys and loud voices by the kiosk outside our cell. Sue and I are unlocked at 8am, 30 minutes before work. We can get cornflakes and two slices of toast from the servery, though most people head straight to the hot-water tap to make coffee.<br><br>There is a clamour to the morning routine. Groggy chatter over cereal. Blaring music from the cells of prisoners no one dares to challenge. Shouting and bar-rattling from a group demanding to be let out to collect medication. Others appeal to officers for more paper in the kiosk to print out movement slips. We all need a movement slip to go anywhere in the prison. It looks like a shop receipt and is your passport through the multitude of locked gates between you and your appointment. No slip, and you stay locked in your cell.<br><br>Thankfully I have my slip, so after breakfast I’m released from my wing and join a group of prisoners flowing through another barred gate to emerge into a garden. It’s a brief moment of fresh air before we head into another stark building with windowless rooms and bars across every entrance.<br><br>I spot a friend and we line up for a fingerprint scan. I have found a job in a workshop, refurbishing old bicycles that go to charity. It can be stimulating to learn a skill, and practical tasks give you purpose. Other workspaces run similarly: there’s a cafe, a salon, an art centre, gardens and a cleaning academy.<br><br>At 11.45am, we head back to our wings for lunch, and are then locked in our cells. I am let out at 2pm, and once again head to work. Today our cells are searched for drugs. The officers take our extra flask and cup, and what they consider excess fruit. Sue is left with the job of reassembling our home.<br><br>When I get back I thank her and, deflated, we join the queue for dinner (served about 4-5pm), plastic plates in hand. Tensions can flare at queue times, especially after cell searches. Officers change so frequently that it’s often community-savvy inmates who step in. Today, my friend Kay talks down a pair of prisoners and prevents them from kicking off. She supports everyone with love and care and timely injections of humour.<br><br>Our hot meal is followed by our daily hour of fresh air. It’s warm outside; most people sit and vape and soak up the sun. Vape oil is a valuable commodity in the prison.<br><br>I walk round our yard with Anne. She’s depressed. After being released on probation last month, she missed an appointment with her probation officer because she was sick. She was recalled to prison and now has to complete her full sentence. Prison recall rates are shocking: a recent report found that for every 100 people released on licence from April to June 2024, 73 were recalled. Sometimes that’s due to administrative errors relating to tags, but many people don’t get the support they need to rebuild their lives on the outside. One woman I know who struggled with alcohol misuse was just told before she was released: “Try not to drink.”<br><br>When officers call us back inside, it’s like a starting gun is fired. Some rush to shower or grab flasks for hot water. Others conspire to stay out as long as possible, heralding a lot of shouting, arguing and the eventual slamming of everyone’s doors for the night. Then, to the relief of some but the misery of others, time, lots of time. It’s common to hear banging and shouting through the night.<br><br>There are many people here who shouldn’t be in a prison setting. They should be getting mental health or drug rehabilitation support. This is a destabilising environment for everyone, and particularly for them. Our whole prison system needs to change. There’s a new government in place, and James Timpson has been appointed as prisons minister. I hope he gives the whole system a radical rethink.<br><br>One of my priorities is to stay connected to what is happening across the UK and the world. In prison, without the internet and with scant access to newspapers – which are often censored – limited TV and radio channels are the only source of news. In a shared cell, if one person watches the TV or listens to the radio, you both do. The space is too tight.<br><br>Fortunately Sue and I both want to catch up on daily news. This week we are stunned by the killing of three children in Southport who were enjoying a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Both of us are parents, and our thoughts are with their anguished families and community. We watch the vigils in silence.<br><br>In the following days, we are sickened by the racially motivated hate riots whipped up by social media posts and exacerbated by irresponsible political rhetoric. Later, those arrested for violent assault and arson will be sentenced to an average of two years. The contrast between their sentences and my own feels grim and stark. Fellow prisoners tell me they are shocked by the discrepancy. One Saturday, I catch the Any Answers? phone-in on Radio 4. It is dominated by callers arguing for and against the contrast. The court response to the rioters does seem to wake more people up to how unfit for purpose our criminal justice system is.<br><br>In the meantime, I find myself craving connection to those I love – the absence of which is the biggest contrast with life outside. In prison, I feel like a layer of my being has been stripped from me.<br><br>One Friday, around 4pm, I’m in the dinner queue, waiting for an onion and tomato wrap, and talking with Pam. She’s on remand for actions in protest against the horrific situation in Gaza. She has been classified as a terrorist. This means she is restricted from outside contact and is struggling to be allowed phone calls, emails or visits. Not surprisingly, she feels isolated.<br><br>After dinner, I talk to Sue, who is distraught. She was not collected in time to make her 30-minute video call with her daughter and tiny granddaughter (video calls happen in a room on the other side of the prison, and prisoners have to be collected and escorted there). She is feeling the loss of connection acutely. Her frustration is compounded by news of yet another postponement of her trial. She’s on remand and highly likely to be found not guilty.<br><br>We wake up early with the sun streaming through the curtainless window. Saturday turns out to be a good day. Fresh air is even called twice. I go to chess club, run by a very good chess player on the outside. There are some stimulating activities offered here: students from a university are running sessions on philosophy.<br><br>I wouldn’t say I feel more “at home” now, but I’m more aware of how things work. Inside, I can feel joy at things, or get excited, but I don’t get the intensity of feeling that I would on the outside. It is like something – a crucial part of myself – has been left out there.<br><br>I have a knot in my stomach as I climb down from my bunk this morning. Things are again in flux. My pictures are no longer clinging to the wall with toothpaste. My clothes are rolled and stuffed into plastic bags. Books and toiletries are in my laundry bag. Today I am being transported to another prison, HMP Send in Surrey.</p>

    <p>I feel mixed emotions. I requested the move, was happy to be rejoining my co-defendants Cressie and Lucia, and expected a calmer environment. But Sue, my neighbour Rachel and the bike workshop have kept me going. We exchange homemade cards and tearful hugs. We inmates are regularly moved like pawns on a chess board. It’s difficult to settle. Inter-prison communication is discouraged and hard to set up, so most lose contact and just fish for snippets of news of old friends when new prisoners transfer.<br><br>After the concrete fortress of Bronzefield, HMP Send is a breath of fresh air – quieter, with more greenery. It is also a bit like going back in time. Everything is done on paper, the walls are painted with murals and there is a public address system that reminds me of a 70s holiday camp I stayed in when I was nine. My fellow newcomers and I are met by a helpful inmate Jenny, who explains how things work, then sends us on our way to the induction cells.<br><br>At 9am the next morning, Jenny is there again to give us a tour. When we enter the servery, I am suddenly hugged by Lucia, who spots me while working in the kitchen. A beautiful reunion. I give Cressie a hug later that day.<br><br>Sign up to Inside Saturday<br><br>The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine. Sign up to get the inside story from our top writers as well as all the must-read articles and columns, delivered to your inbox every weekend.<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>Conversation, connection and mutual support flow more easily here – and thankfully I have a cell to myself. At Bronzefield, many people are held while awaiting trial, and people are constantly coming in and out. At Send, people have already been sentenced. People’s reasons for being at Send are generally a taboo subject, but we sense we are on the same emotional journey: we feel the low mood and the dull ache of missed friends and family that never abates.<br><br>At lunch I sit next to Fran, also a recent transfer from Bronzefield. She valued the money she got from working there and was concerned she would struggle at Send. It may sound strange that prisoners are paid, but this has to be the case. Not everyone has people on the outside who can send in funds. Food is provided, but you need money to make phone calls, and wages are scant. You get paid anywhere between 50p and £3 for a two- to three-hour work session. A standard wage is £15 a week, and you can easily spend half your wages on calls. Most people will also need to buy toiletries and extra food provisions at the prison shop. Vapes are a common expense – vape oil costs £3 a box, and people often buy five boxes a week. The basic prison pillow is uncomfortable, and there’s an option to buy a better one.<br><br>Virtually everybody I speak to who wants to share their story has been a victim of domestic violence or other forms of violence. Most prisoners arrive carrying a lot of trauma. They have failed to get the support they need on the outside, and prison is used as a convenient way to lock them out of sight.<br><br>HMP Send feels like a community. It needs to. Many inmates are facing decades within these walls, a chilling thought that regularly hits me. I’ve been here just one month, and already I sense my world shrinking. Time and again I well up with tears of sadness, and sometimes outrage, at others’ stories. There are women incarcerated for up to a third of their lifetime despite being deemed no risk to the public.<br><br>There are things that occupy us here. There’s work in gardens or kitchens, vocational training, such as hairdressing, education at the Open University, peer support, clubs such as choir or crochet. There are mental health support programmes and gym facilities. The chaplaincy runs services and offers a range of support for all faiths.<br><br>It feels chillier now, so I’m happy to have been able to collect property brought in for me – things that were sent by friends and approved by prison staff: winter clothes, towels, a radio, an exercise mat and art materials.<br><br>At 8.30am, I go to work in the gardens, where we grow vegetables in polytunnels. It is refreshing to be outside, surrounded by trees. The morning shift finishes at 11.45am, and we return to our cells to be locked behind doors for the noon roll-call and lunch.<br><br>Meals here generally follow a four-week rotation. At breakfast, you can have a packet of cereal. Lunch will be a hot meal. Dinner is often cold, perhaps a salad with some beans or a vegan sausage roll. It’s an improvement on Bronzefield, where a lot of the food was frozen. We even thought the fruit might be frozen because it was so tasteless.<br><br>I miss the ordinary activities of everyday life. I value the prison parkrun every Saturday morning, which links with the national event. We do seven loops of the same circuit, within the walls.<br><br>After a run today, I speak with Dawn as we cool down. She is on a 20-year sentence for having killed someone in a moment of diminished responsibility (a legal term that refers to someone’s judgment being impaired due to “an abnormality of mental functioning”). These extenuating circumstances were not properly considered in court. She would love to appeal, but it is too expensive. The only way would be to sell her home and render her children homeless. The law favours the wealthy, people with enough money to pay their way through the system.<br><br>The result of the US election has made this feel like a particularly dark time for the environment and social justice. I’m sick to the core that someone who advocates “drill, baby, drill” has gained such power. I talk about the news with my co-defendants and friends in the garden. We feel deflated, but being together, sharing how we feel, lifts our spirits.<br><br>As weeks pass, I struggle to recall how long I’ve been in prison. I calculate it as just over 20 weeks. I’m not institutionalised, but I have got into a rhythm. The key factors in determining how manageable prison life is seem to be location, luck and whether you have “enhancement”, a status you can apply for, which grants you more privileges. Most prisoners aim for enhancement, but it can be hard to attain. I never bothered at Bronzefield, but once I knew I was moving to Send, I tried hard. At Send, your standard level only gives you three outside visitors a month. With enhanced, you could get four.<br><br>The enhanced wing at Send also gives prisoners better accommodation, and more time unlocked. People have been waiting years to get in. When I arrived it was suggested I apply immediately, and I was offered a place in five weeks. I didn’t take it. People had been waiting a long time, and it suggested to me that it was a case of “if the face fits”. It seems to be easier to be favoured if you’re white and middle class.<br><br>As the month draws to a close, I feel I’m coping well with my incarceration.

In fact, I have found more people in prison who accept me and recognise the need to work against climate breakdown and reform our systems than I have in my community outside these walls.<br><br>How much divides a prisoner from a member of the public? If we listen to the press, the two are worlds apart. Prisoners are bad people who need to be locked away. But prisoners are parents, children, friends, with hopes and dreams. They’re integral parts of families and wider communities. A prison sentence can shatter more lives than one. Most prisoners want to rebuild their lives; they just need support to do so. The question we need to ask is not “What have you done?” but “What has happened to you?” We need to be bold and compassionate, and transition to a system focused on rehabilitation rather than punishment. This can be provided in our communities, rather than our prisons.<br><br>Outside each of the cell doors in HMP Send is a motivational phrase on a small laminated piece of card. My door has this one: “The secret of change is to focus all your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new.” I pass it every day, and it’s this spirit of hope, resistance and belief in radical change that I’m carrying into the new year.<br><br>Some names have been changed.

    <p>In Minnesota, law enforcement – which along with other agencies received millions of dollars in payments from the Canadian company Enbridge behind Line 3 – more than 1,000 arrests were made between December 2020 and September 2021 as nonviolent protesters tried to stop the rerouting and expansion of the 1,097-mile tar sands oil pipeline through Indigenous lands and waterways.

The Slapps include a $300m lawsuit filed against Greenpeace US by the US company behind the DAPL, Energy Transfer, which alleges that the non-profit organized the massive Indigenous resistance at Standing Rock. The case, which experts fear could have major ramifications for advocacy, is scheduled to open in North Dakota next summer.<br><br>This year has marked a further blow to the constitutional right to protest in the US, starting with the fatal police shooting of forest protector and anti-Cop City activist Manuel Esteban Paez Terán in Atlanta in January 2023.

    <p>Protestors stormed the 18th green during the final round of the Travelers Championship Sunday afternoon.<br><br>As Tom Kim stood on the final green with a chance to force a playoff against World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, with the pair poised to take their final putts on the 18th, the gripping finale of the PGA Tour&#x27;s final non-cut signature event took another twist.<br><br>A group of climate change protesters representing &#x27;Extinction Rebellion&#x27; slipped under the ropes, bypassed Cromwell police and stormed the putting surface in astonishing scenes.<br><br>The fairway invaders, who appeared to be wearing climate change messages on their t-shirts, tossed red, white and yellow powder at the golf course, with one even trampling through a greenside bunker.<br><br>The group of at least five were swiftly arrested by law enforcement on site and carted away. However, the destruction they left in their wake delayed the thrilling end to the tournament.<br><br>Tour officials were called to the green where groundskeepers waited with leaf blowers ready to be called into action.<br><br>Some of the intruders wore t-shirts with the message &#x27;No Golf On A Dead Planet&#x27; emblazoned across the front.<br><br>Police handcuffed at least five people, according to CBS play-by-play man Jim Nantz.<br><br>After they were escorted off the course, Scheffler left a potential 26-foot clincher from the fringe on the right edge of the cup, then tapped in for par.<br><br>If the delay heightened Kim&#x27;s nerves at all he didn&#x27;t show it. Following the greenside drama, the 22-year-old calmly stepped up and sank his birdie putt to tie the world&#x27;s top-ranked golfer and force a play off.<br><br>&#x27;It kind of took like the meaning of the putt kind of a way for a second,&#x27; Kim later told the media. &#x27;Because for the past 17 and a half holes all you&#x27;re thinking about is golf, and suddenly when that happens you&#x27;re almost not even playing golf anymore.<br><br>&#x27;I thought it was a dream for a second. The security guards were tackling people and people were getting arrested, it&#x27;s really hard to see nowadays.<br><br>&#x27;It took my mind off of the moment and [I] just kind of realized what was happening and obviously even though those people did something bad, you still don&#x27;t want them to get hurt.

    <p>Greta Thunberg was arrested by the Metropolitan Police for &#x27;refusing to move&#x27; when told to by police officers during a protest against an oil and gas conference in central London, according to eyewitnesses.<br><br>The 20-year-old Swedish activist could be seen smiling as she was detained by officers and led to a waiting police van after joining a protest outside the Energy Intelligence Forum (EIF) - formerly the Oil and Money conference - at the Intercontinental Hotel Park Lane.<br><br>In footage shared on social media, officers could be seen frogmarching the campaigner to the van as other protesters were told to stand back. The Met Police said it had arrested 21 protesters today.<br><br>Fossil Free London, which organised the demo, told the PA news agency that Thunberg was arrested while linking arms and changing with other activists; she was reportedly taken to Wandsworth police station.<br><br>It&#x27;s the latest arrest for the campaigner, who rose to fame after she began &#x27;striking&#x27; from school in 2018 over what she said was inaction by world governments to tackle climate change.<br><br>She had earlier spoken outside the hotel as part of a protest organised by Fossil Free London against the EIF event, urging eco-activists to &#x27;reclaim the power&#x27; and hitting out at &#x27;spineless&#x27; politicians for failing to act on global warming.<br><br>The Met said it arrested 14 activists under section 14 of the Public Order Act to prevent &#x27;serious disruption&#x27; to the community; it did not name Thunberg.<br><br>Fossil Free London activists banged drums and chanted &#x27;oily, oily money, out, out, out&#x27; as they blocked the hotel entrance; members of Greenpeace later dramatically rappelled down the side of the building to unfurl a banner reading: &#x27;Make big oil pay.&#x27;<br><br>Speakers at the conference include COP28 President-delegate Dr Sultan Ahmed Al-Jaber, net zero minister Graham Stuart, former climate change minister Charles Hendry and senior figures from energy firms BP, Shell, Repsol and ExxonMobil.<br><br>Its agenda includes a discussion on whether the COP climate change gathering is &#x27;still relevant&#x27;.<br><br>Speaking at the guerilla protest prior to her arrest, Ms Thunberg said: &#x27;Behind these closed doors at the Oil and Money conference, spineless politicians are making deals and compromises with lobbyists from destructive industries - the fossil fuel industry.<br><br>&#x27;People all over the world are suffering and dying from the consequences of the climate crisis, caused by these industries, who we allow to meet with our politicians and have privileged access to.<br><br>&#x27;The world is drowning in fossil fuels. Our hopes and dreams and lives are being washed away by a flood of greenwashing and lies.<br><br>&#x27;The people in power are knowingly leading us to the edge of the precipice. They know very well the invaluable things they are sacrificing in order for them to continue squeezing out profits from a dying planet.<br><br>&#x27;We cannot let this continue. The elites of the Oil and Money conference, they have no intention of transition. Their plan is to continue this destructive search of profits.<br><br>&#x27;That is why we have to take direct action to stop this and to kick oily money out of politics. We have no other option but to put our bodies outside this conference and to physically disrupt.<br><br>&#x27;We have to do that every time. We have to continue showing them that they are not going to get away with this. This is only the beginning of this fight and we are going to stay and we are going to come back time and time again until we see real action.&#x27;<br><br>Thunberg added: &#x27;We cannot rely on politicians and the people in power to save us. They have proven time and time again that they always prioritise the fossil fuel industry and destructive industries above people, above their own citizens.<br><br>&#x27;We have to reclaim the power, and that is what we are doing today. We have to kick oily money out.&#x27;<br><br>Protesters outside the Intercontinental, some of whom brought banners associated with Extinction Rebellion, chanted and set off flares as they called for the conference to be &#x27;shut down&#x27;.<br><br>Some held up photographs that they said showed the effects of oil and gas drilling on communities around the world.<br><br>A white fence surrounded the hotel entrance keeping protesters out while police smuggled conference attendees through the crowd of chanting activists and a samba band.<br><br>Later in the morning, activists from Greenpeace abseiled down from the roof of the hotel to unfurl a banner reading &#x27;make big oil pay&#x27;, while a strong wind billowed the message and the protesters against the side of the building.<br><br>Maja Darlington, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, told the PA news agency: &#x27;Oil bosses are toasting each other in a luxury hotel and plotting how to make even larger profits, while millions struggle to rebuild after a summer of extreme weather.<br><br>&#x27;Big oil is profiting from humanity&#x27;s loss and those who have done the least to cause climate change are being forced to pay the price.&#x27;<br><br>Police said they were &#x27;working out&#x27; how to bring them down safely and arrest them &#x27;if appropriate&#x27;.<br><br>Fossil Free London says it is &#x27;blocking&#x27; the conference in protest at &#x27;climate criminals conspir(ing) over canapés&#x27;.<br><br>The action is part of a series of &#x27;action days&#x27; organised by the eco-group, which has carried out several protests across London in recent years.<br><br>It plans further action tomorrow, Thursday and Friday - including a &#x27;Festival of Resistance&#x27; gathering at Marble Arch on Thursday afternoon and a &#x27;Rave and Resist&#x27; after-party at the end of the week.<br><br>Director Robin Wells previously said: &#x27;The main purpose of protesting this forum is to make it clear that the industry is not welcome to come to our city, is not welcome to schmooze our politicians, is not welcome to profit at the expense of the collective survival and the health of the one home that we all share.&#x27;</p>

    <p>Met Police officers could be seen monitoring the protest in Park Lane on Tuesday morning.<br><br>The force said it arrested six people on suspicion of obstructing a highway after receiving reports of the protest at 7.18am on Tuesday.<br><br>It arrested 14 more protesters in the afternoon for breaching section 14 of the Public Order Act and a further one for criminal damage.<br><br>A spokesperson for the force said: &#x27;Officers have been on scene since this morning with a group of protesters in the road outside a hotel in Park Lane, W1.<br><br>&#x27;We have had continued discussions with the protesters and there have been interventions by officers to enable members of the public safe access in and out of the venue. Six people were arrested for obstruction of the highway.<br><br>&#x27;Officers on scene have kept this under constant review and at 1232 imposed conditions on the group under section 14 of the Public Order Act given to prevent serious disruption to the community, hotel and guests.<br><br>&#x27;Officers asked the protesters to move from the road onto the pavement, which would enable them to continue with their demonstration without breaching the conditions.<br><br>&#x27;A number of protesters failed to do so and we have now made a further 14 arrests for section 14 of the public order act and a further one for criminal damage. Officers remain on scene.&#x27;<br><br>The Energy Intelligence Forum says it is a &#x27;platform for fostering debate...and finding answers to the big questions facing the energy industry&#x27;.<br><br>Speakers at the conference include the CEOs of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Aramco and Norway&#x27;s Equinor, the German ambassador to the UK and Graham Stuart, UK energy security and net zero minister.<br><br>Mr Stuart has previously said that allowing oil and gas companies to continue drilling the North Sea for resources is necessary for energy security.<br><br>Discussions during the three-day event include whether the annual COP conferences are &#x27;still relevant&#x27; , &#x27;how far&#x27; renewable power can go, and whether net zero &#x27;will remain the standard&#x27;.<br><br>Tickets for the conference started at £3,650 per person - plus VAT.<br><br>A spokesperson for the Energy Intelligence Forum told MailOnline: &#x27;We recognize the protests at the Energy Intelligence Forum today, and believe this action reaffirms the need for constructive dialogue on climate change and the low-carbon transition.<br><br>&#x27;The Energy Intelligence Forum is a platform for discussing the biggest issues in energy, including the low-carbon transition.<br><br>&#x27;We believe the challenging process of reinventing the world&#x27;s energy system requires the cooperation and collaboration of all sides.<br><br>&#x27;We are committed to bringing together stakeholders in the energy system – governments, companies, finance, civil society, and academia – to discuss the best way forward for the world.<br><br>&#x27;The issue of climate change is being presented and discussed constructively throughout the conference.&#x27;<br><br>Fossil Free London has disrupted events such as BP&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting and an assembly of industry body UK Oil and Gas last year.<br><br>Meanwhile, Thunberg was fined by a Swedish court earlier this month for disobeying police during an environmental protest in July.<br><br>The Malmo District Court ordered her to pay a 2,250 kroner (£169) fine.<br><br>Ms Thunberg, who already had been fined for a similar offence, took part in a July 24 environmental protest at an oil terminal in Malmo, where activists temporarily blocked access to the facility by sitting down and were removed by police.<br><br>On September 15, she was charged with disobedience to law enforcement for refusing to obey police asking her to leave the scene. She then was dragged away by two uniformed officers.<br><br>Thunberg admitted to the facts but denied guilt, saying the fight against the fossil fuel industry was a form of self-defence due to the existential and global threat of the climate crisis.<br><br>After the verdict, she said: &#x27;We have the science on our side and we have morality on our side.<br><br>&#x27;Nothing in the world can change that and so it is. I am ready to act based on the conditions that exist and whether it leads to more sentences.&#x27;<br><br>On June 24, the same court fined her 2,500 kroner (£188) for refusing to obey police orders when taking part in a similar demonstration the previous month.<br><br>Earlier this year, Thunberg also pulled out of an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book Festival after accusing sponsors, investment firm Baillie Gifford, of &#x27;greenwashing&#x27;.<br><br>Tuesday&#x27;s action comes weeks after the UK government green-lit the controversial Rosebank oil field in the North Sea.<br><br>Around 350million barrels of oil are said to lie untapped in the oil field off the coast of the Shetland Islands, and Tories have hailed its approval as a means of reducing the UK&#x27;s reliance on Russian oil and gas - but opponents say the project amounts to &#x27;environmental vandalism&#x27;.<br><br>Lauren McDonald, a campaigner against Rosebank, said at Tuesday&#x27;s protest: &#x27;The only reason that they continue to pursue this is for profit, there is no justification for this.<br><br>&#x27;So as we head into another round of climate talks, we are demanding that Norway - that wealthy happy country that is powered by green energy at home - we are demanding that Norway stops putting the brakes on other countries&#x27; energy transitions.<br><br>&#x27;We are demanding that Norway stops profiteering while others around the world are struggling to pay their bills, struggling to live and struggling to survive in our destabilising climate.&#x27;</p>

They have been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage.<br><br>Earlier, Phoebe Plummer, 23, was given a two-year jail term, while Anna Holland, 22, got 20 months, for throwing soup over Sunflowers 1888 in October 2022.<br><br>The National Gallery said the two paintings targeted on Friday had been removed for examination and were found to be undamaged.<br><br>As the latest activists – two women and a man - threw soup over the two paintings, onlookers could be heard shouting &quot;no&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t do it&quot;.<br><br>In a video posted on X by JSO, the activists can be heard telling an angry crowd: &quot;There are people in prison for demanding an end to new oil and gas, something which is now government policy after sustained, disruptive actions, countless headlines and the resulting political pressure.</p>

One in five Australian eco-protests led to arrests, compared with about 17% in the UK. The global average rate is 6.7%.<br><br>The research comes amid an outcry over the targeting of climate and environmental protesters, with a rise in the suppression of dissent around the world as the climate, biodiversity and pollution crises take hold.<br><br>It found an increase in the number and proportion of protests linked to climate and environmental destruction over the past decade, but argued that rather than tackling the issues provoking them, states are focusing on punishing dissent.<br><br>Michel Forst, the UN special rapporteur for environmental defenders, said earlier this year: “In many countries, the state response to peaceful environmental protest is increasingly to repress rather than to enable and protect those seeking to speak up for the environment.”<br><br>The latest research paints a picture of extensive repression of climate and environmental protest in the global north and south, with distinct characteristics in each region contributing to the overall trend.<br><br>“There is an increasing criminalisation and repression of climate and environmental protest,” said Oscar Berglund, a political economist at the University of Bristol who led the study. “These kinds of protests have increased, climate protests quite sharply, and the response to this has been a crackdown that has to be seen in the wider political sense of a breakdown in climate action.”<br><br>Berglund and his colleagues looked at data collected by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data database between 2012 and 2023, focusing specifically on the countries that had more than 1,000 protest events registered for that period. They then narrowed down their focus to 14 countries representing all six populated continents for a qualitative analysis.<br><br>Following academic convention, they drew a terminological distinction between environmental protest and climate protest. Environmental protests were defined as those that target destructive projects such as mining, dams or large scale construction, while climate protests are a generally newer phenomenon, mainly concentrated in the global north. They are geographically separate from the projects they oppose and have broader political demands.</p>

    <p>The researchers found that both kinds of protest had increased, but the data showed a particularly sharp rise in the number of climate protests towards the end of the 2010s, coinciding with the growth of the youth-led Fridays for Future movement and groups such as Extinction Rebellion in the UK and the Sunrise Movement in the US.<br><br>Across the countries studied, an average of 6.7% of climate and environmental protests led to arrests, but the figure varied widely with the highest rates in the global north, not just in Australia and the UK, but also Norway, which had a rate of 15.1%.<br><br>The countries with the lowest arrest rates were Brazil at 0.6%, Peru at 2% and Uganda at 2.2%, but these were also the countries with the highest levels of police violence.<br><br>Sign up to Down to Earth<br><br>The planet&#x27;s most important stories. Get all the week&#x27;s environment news - the good, the bad and the essential<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>There were more than 2,000 killings of environmental defenders during the period studied, the researchers said, citing figures collated by the NGO Global Witness.<br><br>The researchers also found that new laws in the UK, the US, Australia and elsewhere had created new offences, increased sentence lengths for non-violent protest and minor acts of sabotage, and given police new powers to stop protests during them and before they take place.<br><br>The UK’s Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2021 and the Public Order Act 2022 transformed the relationship between protesters and the state, handing police extensive new powers to curtail protests and criminalising a range of protest activities. Berglund said his team’s research had found that these moves had been followed by many other countries.<br><br>At the same time, states around the world have repurposed existing powers. “One really alarming trend has been this use of organised crime legislation,” said Berglund, citing the case of activists from Futuro Vegetal in Spain. “In no possible way can you say that these are organised criminals.”</p></td>

The global average rate is 6.7%.<br><br>The research comes amid an outcry over the targeting of climate and environmental protesters, with a rise in the suppression of dissent around the world as the climate, biodiversity and pollution crises take hold.<br><br>It found an increase in the number and proportion of protests linked to climate and environmental destruction over the past decade, but argued that rather than tackling the issues provoking them, states are focusing on punishing dissent.<br><br>Michel Forst, the UN special rapporteur for environmental defenders, said earlier this year: “In many countries, the state response to peaceful environmental protest is increasingly to repress rather than to enable and protect those seeking to speak up for the environment.”<br><br>The latest research paints a picture of extensive repression of climate and environmental protest in the global north and south, with distinct characteristics in each region contributing to the overall trend.<br><br>“There is an increasing criminalisation and repression of climate and environmental protest,” said Oscar Berglund, a political economist at the University of Bristol who led the study. “These kinds of protests have increased, climate protests quite sharply, and the response to this has been a crackdown that has to be seen in the wider political sense of a breakdown in climate action.”<br><br>Berglund and his colleagues looked at data collected by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data database between 2012 and 2023, focusing specifically on the countries that had more than 1,000 protest events registered for that period. They then narrowed down their focus to 14 countries representing all six populated continents for a qualitative analysis.<br><br>Following academic convention, they drew a terminological distinction between environmental protest and climate protest. Environmental protests were defined as those that target destructive projects such as mining, dams or large scale construction, while climate protests are a generally newer phenomenon, mainly concentrated in the global north. They are geographically separate from the projects they oppose and have broader political demands.</p>

    <p>The researchers found that both kinds of protest had increased, but the data showed a particularly sharp rise in the number of climate protests towards the end of the 2010s, coinciding with the growth of the youth-led Fridays for Future movement and groups such as Extinction Rebellion in the UK and the Sunrise Movement in the US.<br><br>Across the countries studied, an average of 6.7% of climate and environmental protests led to arrests, but the figure varied widely with the highest rates in the global north, not just in Australia and the UK, but also Norway, which had a rate of 15.1%.<br><br>The countries with the lowest arrest rates were Brazil at 0.6%, Peru at 2% and Uganda at 2.2%, but these were also the countries with the highest levels of police violence.<br><br>Sign up to Down to Earth<br><br>The planet&#x27;s most important stories. Get all the week&#x27;s environment news - the good, the bad and the essential<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>There were more than 2,000 killings of environmental defenders during the period studied, the researchers said, citing figures collated by the NGO Global Witness.<br><br>The researchers also found that new laws in the UK, the US, Australia and elsewhere had created new offences, increased sentence lengths for non-violent protest and minor acts of sabotage, and given police new powers to stop protests during them and before they take place.<br><br>The UK’s Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2021 and the Public Order Act 2022 transformed the relationship between protesters and the state, handing police extensive new powers to curtail protests and criminalising a range of protest activities. Berglund said his team’s research had found that these moves had been followed by many other countries.<br><br>At the same time, states around the world have repurposed existing powers. “One really alarming trend has been this use of organised crime legislation,” said Berglund, citing the case of activists from Futuro Vegetal in Spain. “In no possible way can you say that these are organised criminals.”</p></td>

    <p>“Jesus was an activist, no doubt about it,” the Rev Dr Sue Parfitt says from a flowery armchair in her quaint cottage in Bristol. The octogenarian looks up to her mantelpiece at a wooden figure of Christ on the cross. “He broke the law continually and in the end was arrested and executed for it.” In the armchair opposite, Judy Bruce, 85, a retired biology teacher, smiles wryly.<br><br>A quiche may be warming in the oven, but Bruce and Parfitt aren’t here for a polite ladies’ lunch. A week ago they were arrested after the display case of Magna Carta at the British Library was chipped with a hammer and chisel. They held a banner that declared: “The government is breaking the law.” The act was carried out on behalf of Just Stop Oil (JSO). Bruce and Parfitt were both arrested and charged with £2,000 in criminal damage.<br><br>Since JSO was founded in 2022, its headline-grabbing stunts of civil disobedience — which it calls “actions” — have become a familiar sight. The climate group has managed to unite most of the country in irritation. Orange paint, soup and powder has been sprayed everywhere from snooker tournaments and art galleries to tennis matches and universities.<br><br>So why are two respectable elderly women, a reverend and a teacher, risking getting arrested in the name of the climate?<br><br>Over a cup of tea (with oat milk), and with Parfitt’s cats Holly and Mistletoe at their feet, the pair explain how they got into radical climate activism.<br><br>Parfitt, 82, was raised a Christian by conservative parents in south Wales. She read history at Bristol University and was briefly involved with the peace movement in the late 1960s but stopped because she feared being arrested at such a young age.<br><br>“It’s a different matter getting arrested in my eighties,” she says, matter-of-factly. “The point is to make the best use of your latter years. And what could be a better use than trying to save humanity from extinction?”<br><br>After stints as a nun and a family therapist, Parfitt married an Anglican priest and trained as one herself. When her husband died in 2013 she joined Christian Climate Action, which has since become the de facto Christian wing of Extinction Rebellion.<br><br>Bruce came to activism later in life, after retiring from teaching biology in a private school and moving to Swansea. She remembers always showing concern for things such as the ozone layer and GM crops, but became involved with Extinction Rebellion after her partner, who she says would have disapproved of her being arrested, died in 2020.<br><br>“When I first heard of doing actions that would end up with arrest, I thought, ‘Oh no. I don’t want to do that. Bad people do that!’ ” She was involved in a march during the G7 summit in Cornwall in 2021, but was motivated to break the law after “realising that non-arrestable ways of doing things are not making any impact at all”.</p>

    <p>They don’t exactly fit the classic profile of radical activists: Parfitt walks with a cane and Bruce is very slight, in a blue cardigan with pearl buttons. But both talk passionately about the climate crisis with a steely determination.<br><br>Bruce tells me she and Parfitt met “sitting in front of an oil tanker” in April 2022 and teamed up again at the suggestion of JSO when they unfurled a banner during a thanksgiving service at St Paul’s Cathedral that read: “Will our children thank us?”<br><br>“I think they had the idea that these two oldies might drum up some interest,” Parfitt says with a chuckle.<br><br>But they draw the line at some stunts. They turned down a suggestion to break the glass covering the Rokeby Venus painting in the National Gallery, chosen because it had been slashed by the suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914. (Two other JSO activists were arrested after it was vandalised in November and have pleaded not guilty to causing criminal damage.)<br><br>Parfitt’s background as a historian means she wants to ensure any painting or historical document will not be damaged. “There was no question there was any risk to Magna Carta, nor would we want there to be,” she says.<br><br>“We’re incredibly law-abiding citizens — believe it or not,” says Bruce.<br><br>Parfitt, still a practising Anglican priest, says the Church isn’t “terribly happy” about her involvement. “I have to report to my bishop every action I take,” she says.<br><br>Parfitt and Bruce know their actions rub people up the wrong way: they have lost friends and had fractious exchanges with family members. Bruce has been manhandled by a passerby. The two say they are vilified online and called “arthritic old codgers”, as Bruce puts it. “Well, I am arthritic,” Parfitt says with a laugh.<br><br>Both say the ageism they experience makes them feel sad rather than hurt. Parfitt says that as well as challenging perceptions of 80-year-olds, she wants to challenge their own age group too. “I often say to my friends, ‘Why don’t you come and do this, what have you got to lose?’. I don’t have grandchildren, but I say to people, ‘I’m doing this for your grandchildren’.”<br><br>But is it working? JSO floundered last year as its biggest donor, the green energy tycoon Dale Vince, announced he was cutting the cash supply, admitting that no amount of protesting would stop the government from North Sea drilling.<br><br>Are Bruce and Parfitt aware their actions may have alienated the public? They agree that climate activists can come across as preaching and self-righteous,“but in what other way is it possible to influence governmental action?” asks Bruce. “If we don’t do things that annoy people, it doesn’t get into the news.”</p>

        <h1>Just Stop Oil protesters who threw soup on Van Gogh painting jailed</h1><h2>Anna Holland and Phoebe Plummer, both 22, were found guilty of criminal damage in July</h2><p>Two Just Stop Oil activists have been jailed after throwing tinned tomato soup over Vincent Van Gogh’s Sunflowers masterpiece.<br><br>Anna Holland and Phoebe Plummer, both 22, were found guilty of criminal damage at Southwark Crown Court in July.<br><br>Plummer was sentenced to two years and Holland received 20 months on Friday.<br><br>While the painting was not harmed in the attack, there was damage to its 17th-century gold-coloured frame, which prosecutors said was “a piece of art in itself”.<br><br>The court had heard that the soup, which the pair bought at a nearby Tesco, acted like paint stripper on the wood frame.<br><br>In a video from the attack, Plummer was heard saying: “What is worth more, art or life?

The student is considering a case of false imprisonment.<br><br>The protests over the past four weeks coincided with the British government confirming in the king’s speech its plans to grant new North Sea oil and gas licences every year.<br><br>Police are using new powers to make the mass arrests under section 7 of the Conservative government’s Public Order Act 2023, which bans any action that “interferes with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure”.<br><br>According to data gathered by Just Stop Oil and not disputed by the Metropolitan police, almost half of the arrests were carried out under section 7. The offence carries a prison sentence of up to 12 months.<br><br>The 19-year-old student, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was held in a London prison for four nights after his arrest under section 7. After the first night in prison, he appeared by video link for a court appearance. He was bailed by the court, and should have been released. The student was held for a further three nights in a prison cell, according to testimony given to the Guardian.<br><br>“I consider that I was illegally imprisoned over the three nights of that weekend and will be taking a case of wrongful imprisonment,” the student said.<br><br>Another 19-year-old student who was arrested and also cannot be named for legal reasons, was held for 50 hours in a London police cell, from a Monday morning to Wednesday at 1pm.<br><br>She was charged under section 7 of the act after 24 hours in custody, but held for another day-and-a-half in custody before being taken to court.<br><br>“I remember asking for my medication, and I didn’t get it,” she said. “I asked multiple times. One of the officers said: ‘Why didn’t you have it with you?’ I said: ‘I didn’t expect to be held for 50 hours in a cell.’ And the officer said: ‘What, after what you have done?’<br><br>“Like I was a murderer or something, they just wanted me to feel bad.”<br><br>Jun Pang, a policy and campaigns officer for Liberty, said: “We all have the right to make our voices heard on the issues that matter to us. The staggering number of people arrested in recent weeks, many under this new legislation, shows just how sweeping and dangerous these powers are. It’s shocking to see hundreds of young protesters criminalised simply for standing up for what they believe in.”</p>

    <p>Scotland Yard said 630 arrests had been made of Just Stop Oil protesters since 30 October, and 328 people went on to be charged. The rest have been released on police bail.<br><br>JSO data shows at least 276 people have been charged: at least 125 were charged with blocking key national infrastructure under section 7 and 125 with the lesser offence of wilful obstruction of the highway.<br><br>Sign up to Down to Earth<br><br>The planet&#x27;s most important stories. Get all the week&#x27;s environment news - the good, the bad and the essential<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>Just Stop Oil said: “They’re imprisoning peaceful protesters, protecting the real criminals, and licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects while everything burns.”<br><br>The widespread use of section 7 appears to have taken its toll on Just Stop Oil’s latest campaign of protest. On Wednesday, just half a dozen people turned up at Trafalgar Square, with only three wearing orange bibs with the group’s insignia. A couple of police officers hovered nearby.<br><br>Asked why they thought so few had come, one demonstrator said: “Everyone’s been arrested, everyone’s got court.”<br><br>Rachel Payne, 73, said she had already been jailed for her part in Just Stop Oil’s campaign during last year’s Cop27 climate talks.<br><br>She said the law had narrowed down what they were able to do as protest. “Last week, I saw them [protesters] get to the top of Whitehall and as soon as they put their feet on the road swarms of police just arrested them – two days running.<br><br>“In this country it’s supposed to be a free country. [Facilitating] protest is supposed to be a duty of the police – to enable protest – and yet they [the protesters] were not even allowed to be there.”<br><br>A university lecturer who knows one of those arrested said he believed the use of section 7 for walking down a road was disproportionate for such a peaceful protest.<br><br>Graham Mann, a lecturer in atmospheric science at Leeds University, said: “My perspective from being a PhD student in the 90s and the urgency of the climate emergency then, the science is very, very clear and has been for a long time. The urgency to decarbonise to reduce emissions has become even greater. So I can understand young people taking these actions.”<br><br>A spokesperson for Climate Action Support Pathway, which provides advice to those considering taking action, said: “This was the first real test for these new section 7 powers, and it became quickly clear that the police were going to use them readily. We changed the emphasis of our advice to those considering taking part as a result because section 7 carries a higher maximum penalty of a year in prison, and people need to be making informed choices about whether they want to take action or not.”<br><br>Asked about the 19-year-old student held in a London prison, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We are looking into this matter.”<br><br>Scotland Yard said: “All of the decisions on whether to charge, bail or NFA [no further action] Just Stop Oil activists have all been made within the 24 hours. We are working with magistrates courts across London, and in some cases in other counties, to put the activists who have been charged before magistrates at the earliest opportunity. However, there is only a limited number of people who can be seen by magistrates each day so it is not always possible for them to appear on the day they are charged.”</p></td>

    <p>Eco-fanatics caused outrage yesterday by defacing Stonehenge on the eve of the summer solstice.<br><br>Just Stop Oil activists used fire extinguishers to spray orange powder paint on at least three of the ancient stones before calmly sitting down cross-legged in front of the world-famous site.<br><br>Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer showed a rare united front in their condemnation of the stunt, which raised new questions about the historically intimate relationship between the Labour Party and Just Stop Oil.<br><br>The Prime Minister described it as a &#x27;disgraceful act of vandalism&#x27;, while the Labour leader branded the group &#x27;pathetic&#x27;.<br><br>Yet Labour was accused of &#x27;faux outrage&#x27; after JSO boasted of planning its action &#x27;days after the Labour Party recommitted to halting all future oil and gas licences&#x27; – a policy the activists claim was influenced by their extremist road-blocking tactics.<br><br>Mr Sunak rounded on major Labour backer Dale Vince, who, until last year, bankrolled the environmental protest movement.<br><br>He said: &#x27;This is a disgraceful act of vandalism. Just Stop Oil should be ashamed of their activists and they and anyone associated with them, including a certain Labour party donor, should issue a condemnation of this shameful act immediately.&#x27;<br><br>Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho added: &#x27;Labour&#x27;s faux outrage at the Stonehenge vandalism would carry a lot more weight if Just Stop Oil hadn&#x27;t also thanked Labour for enacting &#x27;their demands&#x27; in their press release today.<br><br>We must not allow Britain&#x27;s energy policy to be dictated by fanatics.&#x27;<br><br>Labour has accepted more than £5 million from Mr Vince, including £1 million after the election was called.<br><br>The green energy tycoon supported JSO from its foundation and donated at least £340,000 before cutting off the cash last October.<br><br>Sir Keir has previously come under fire for refusing to return any money donated by Mr Vince and has vehemently denied claims that the Ecotricity boss wields any influence over Labour policy.<br><br>Mr Vince said: &#x27;Since Rishi Sunak has asked me personally to comment, I will. I don&#x27;t support what JSO did today.&#x27;<br><br>But the close relationship with Mr Vince, who Sir Keir met just days before revealing a plan to block all new oil and gas licences in the North Sea last year – coupled with the party&#x27;s previous opposition to toughening up laws around disruptive protests – has left questions over whether Labour can be trusted to crack down on such behaviour.</p>

I would incarcerate them on an old oil rig.&#x27;<br><br>Fellow Tory Alex Stafford said: &#x27;It&#x27;s absolutely disgusting – these mindless vandals have no appreciation for our history and heritage. All they can do is destroy rather than create.&#x27;<br><br>Nick Kendrick, 55, who has been a Stonehenge tour guide for more than 30 years, said: &#x27;There are 79 different species of lichen which grow on those rocks.<br><br>&#x27;These lichen are alive and help protect the stone and (they) will definitely have been harmed by this idiotic stunt.&#x27;<br><br>Just Stop Oil said: &#x27;Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything.&#x27;</p>

    <p>Hallam and Maxey were &#x27;instrumental in either the creation or carrying through of this plan&#x27; and Lynch-White also was &#x27;closely involved&#x27;, the prosecution said.<br><br>Hallam, representing himself, said the &#x27;public nuisance was insignificant to non-existent in my case&#x27; and there was &#x27;no evidence&#x27; he played a leadership role in this offence.<br><br>He added: &#x27;The public nuisance was simply to create publicity for the criminality of creating a third runway.&#x27;<br><br>Michael Goold, defending Maxey, said the defendant was &#x27;motivated by the sincere heartfelt concern, and justified concern, about the climate emergency&#x27;.<br><br>Raj Chada, defending Lynch-White, said: &#x27;During the course of his work, he becomes aware of the dangers of the climate crisis.&#x27;<br><br>Judge Martin Edmunds KC said the plan was developed under the banner of Heathrow Pause and there was evidence Extinction Rebellion members chose not to become involved as they &#x27;valued plans to be too extreme&#x27;.<br><br>He added that the small number of drones flown &#x27;did not cause any disruption to flights&#x27;.<br><br>Hallam and Maxey were each sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for 18 months.<br><br>Lynch-White was handed 17 months, suspended for 18 months.<br><br>Hallam was told to complete 200 hours of unpaid work, Maxey has to complete 300 hours and Lynch-White will have to complete 262 hours. All three defendants will have to complete 10 rehabilitation activity requirement days.<br><br>Before the sentencing, Maxey told the PA news agency: &#x27;It&#x27;s really striking, the injustice of this whole situation, those that have contributed least to this crisis are suffering most and soonest, and injustice when people like myself try and raise the alarm and then we are potentially threatened with prison.<br><br>&#x27;Prison is for violent and sexual offenders it is not for peaceful protesters, so we need to protect our democracy and protect the right to protest.&#x27;<br><br>Lynch-White said before the sentencing that he thought the incident was &#x27;extremely unlikely to cause any disruption&#x27;.<br><br>He added: &#x27;And it turns out it didn&#x27;t cause any disruption.<br><br>&#x27;The reason for that is there was absolutely no threat to anybody.&#x27;</p>

But Labour dropped the appeal and surrendered to the activists. That was a political choice, and it cost Britain dearly.”<br><br>She pledged this “lawfare” would end with the next Tory government, but warned that without urgent action, 180 out of 280 fields will shut down in the next five years.<br><br>Mrs Badenoch said: “This is not a managed transition. This is collapse. Ed Miliband and Keir Starmer are not planning for decades ahead.<br><br>“We are killing this industry now, and if they succeed, they will not just destroy jobs in Aberdeen, but they will destroy our country’s ability to stand on its own two feet.”<br><br>Michael Shanks, however, a Scottish Labour MP and Energy Minister, used his speech to the conference to deliver a coded attack on her oil and gas policy announcements this week.<br><br>He said: “What drives us is a refusal to accept the status quo of the last decade, let down by a government that talked big but allowed thousands upon thousands of jobs to be lost from this industry and countries to steal a march on winning the jobs of the future.<br><br>“It’s easy to stick a few lines in a political press release and call it policy, but the hard work of stewarding the future of this industry is far too complicated for that.<br><br>“North Sea workers and this community deserve a government that says it’s time to invest in the future and manage this transition in a rational, cooperative way.”<br><br>Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, said: “Kemi may be spending a lot of time reading the lines of Trump and Farage, but what she is clearly not reading is the science or economic advice of experts.<br><br>“North Sea reserves are drying up and what’s left and untapped is barely enough to keep it on life support – lasting no more than a few months or years at current rates of consumption.”<br><br>Also on Tuesday, Ms Badenoch addressed Tory MSP Graham Simpson’s defection to Reform UK.<br><br>She said: “If there are people who join other parties because they think they have a better chance of winning, that means they’re doing this for the wrong reasons.”<br><br>The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, Uplift and Greenpeace were approached for comment.</p></td>

    <p>Just Stop Oil protesters who sprayed Stonehenge with orange-coloured corn and paint flour, causing fury across the UK, have been named.<br><br>The activists were caught on camera rushing towards the ancient monument in Wiltshire wearing white t-shirt with the campaign group’s logo. As people yelled at them to stop, they unleashed canisters of orange substances as several of the ancient stones were covered in the bright colour.<br><br>The two protesters were unveiled as Rajan Naidu, 73, and Niamh Lynch, 21. Naidu is believed to be a Quaker from Birmingham while the younger campaigner is a youth representative at the British Trust for Ornithology and an officer from the Oxford University’s Nature Conservation Society. Wiltshire Police have today revealed the arrested pair were released on bail. They said in a statement: “This is to allow us additional time to work with specialists and progress our inquiries.<br><br>&quot;A man in his 70s and a woman in her 20s were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, damaging an ancient monument and deterring a person from engaging in a lawful activity. It follows reports that an orange substance had been sprayed on some of the stones by two suspects. We also continue to work closely with English Heritage.”<br><br>English Heritage chief executive Dr Nick Merriman said this morning there does not appear to be “visible damage” to Stonehenge. Dr Merriman told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme: “It’s difficult to understand and we’re deeply saddened about this vandalism, but we’ve been really touched by the messages of sympathy and support we’ve had.</p>

    <p>“Our experts have already managed to clean the orange powder from the stones because we were really worried about what would happen if they got in contact with water. So far, there seems to be no visible damage. The site is open to the public again and for the solstice tomorrow.<br><br>“It’s vandalism to one of the world’s most celebrated ancient monuments. We wish people would channel their protests away from cultural heritage sites, museums and galleries because we feel that doesn’t actually help their cause, and causes huge upset and disruption to the operation of these important sites.”<br><br>In an earlier statement, a Just Stop Oil spokesperson explained: “The UK’s government in waiting has committed to enacting Just Stop Oil’s original demand of ‘no new oil and gas’. However, we all know this is not enough. Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything. That’s why Just Stop Oil is demanding that our next government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.<br><br>“Failure to commit to defending our communities will mean Just Stop Oil supporters, along with citizens from Austria, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland will join in resistance this summer, if their own Governments do not take meaningful action. Stone circles can be found in every part of Europe showing how we’ve always cooperated across vast distances – we’re building on that legacy.”</p></td>

    <p>Part of Stonehenge has been covered in orange powder paint by protesters. Two Just Stop Oil campaigners sprayed the powder paint on the historic site near Salisbury, Wiltshire, at about 12:00 BST on Wednesday. The move comes the day before celebrations begin for the Summer Solstice at the 5,000-year-old landmark.<br><br>Wiltshire Police confirmed two people had been arrested on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument. Just Stop Oil said the orange powder paint was cornflour and it would &quot;wash away with rain&quot;. The group named the two protesters as Niamh Lynch, a 21-year-old student from Oxford, and Rajan Naidu, a 73-year-old from Birmingham, in a statement.<br><br>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak condemned the incident as a &quot;disgraceful act of vandalism&quot;. Leader of the Labour Party Sir Keir Starmer said the damage was &quot;outrageous&quot; and described Just Stop Oil as &quot;pathetic&quot;.<br><br>Members of the public were heard shouting &quot;no&quot; and seen running to intervene as the campaigners ran up to the stone circle at the Unesco world heritage site. Nick Merriman, chief executive of English Heritage, said the vandalism was &quot;deeply saddening&quot;. He told the BBC&#x27;s Today programme the stones are &quot;testament to people&#x27;s desire to connect to nature&quot;, and while he respected the rights of people to protest, he hoped they would channel their activism away from museum sites in future.</p>

    <p>“Police were called and three people have been arrested. The paintings were removed from display and examined by a conservator and are unharmed. We are aiming to reopen the exhibition as soon as possible.”<br><br>Phoebe Plummer 23, and Anna Holland, 22, were jailed on Friday after causing as much as £10,000 worth of damage to the artwork’s gold-coloured frame when they targeted it at London’s National Gallery. Plummer received a two-year jail term, while Holland was handed 20 months. The protesters, wearing Just Stop Oil T-shirts, threw two tins of Heinz tomato soup over the 1888 work in October 2022, before kneeling down in front of the painting and gluing their hands to the wall beneath it.<br><br>Staff at the gallery inspected the painting and frame for damage while the women were still attached to the wall, and were worried the soup may have dripped through the protective glass. The frame was purchased by the gallery in 1999, the court heard, and was valued at £28,000 before it suffered the estimated £10,000 worth of damage.</p></td>

        <h1>Just Stop Oil protestors throw soup over Van Gogh paintings again as onlookers horrified</h1><p>Just Stop Oil activists have poured soup over two Vincent Van Gogh paintings at the National Gallery. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Just Stop Oil said: &quot;BREAKING: 2 VAN GOGH PAINTINGS SOUPED... 3 Just Stop Oil supporters have thrown soup over 2 of Van Gogh(&#x27;s) paintings in the &#x27;Poets and Lovers&#x27; exhibition at the National Gallery&quot;.<br><br>The post featured a video of the activists vandalising the artwork before telling an angry crowd: &quot;There are people in prison for demanding an end to new oil and gas, something which is now government policy after sustained, disruptive actions, countless headlines and the resulting political pressure. Future generations will regard these prisoners of conscience to be on the right side of history.&quot;<br><br>The National Gallery confirmed the three activists had been arrested and the paintings remain unharmed. A statement said: &quot;At just after 2.30pm this afternoon, three people entered Room 6 of the National Gallery Van Gogh: Poets and Lovers exhibition. They appeared to throw a soup like substance over two works – Sunflowers (1888, National Gallery, London) and Sunflowers (1889, Philadelphia Museum of Art). Police were called and three people have been arrested. The paintings were removed from display and examined by a conservator and are unharmed. We are aiming to reopen the exhibition as soon as possible.&quot;</p>

    <p>GPs with convictions over protests face tribunals to determine whether they can keep licence to practise<br><br>Dr Sarah Benn has long been concerned about the climate crisis, diligently recycling until she was “blue in the face”.

    <p>“There are lots of doctors who are politically active and have done stuff within social justice movements,” noted Benn. “But not, as far as I’m aware, that have ended up with criminal convictions which have then led to a tribunal to assess their fitness to practise.”<br><br>Benn has now retired and is no longer practising as a GP. But she wants the GMC to recognise the importance of her actions, and said doctors should be seen as “trusted messengers”.<br><br>Sign up to Down to Earth<br><br>The planet&#x27;s most important stories. Get all the week&#x27;s environment news - the good, the bad and the essential<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>“Humanity hasn’t faced this sort of existential crisis before that is going to have massive public health implications,” she said. “I’m really worried about my children’s future and my own, and all the people all over the world who are already starving, displaced and suffering right now because of what we’re continuing to do – digging up fossil fuels and burning them. And so penalising somebody who is trying to do something about that, that’s not how we need to go about it.”<br><br>At the very least, she hopes the GMC will develop guidance for the medical profession on activism, which she plans to stay involved in.<br><br>Hart does not believe most doctors appreciate their role at the frontlines of the climate crisis and in drawing public attention to it. He said: “I set out on this course believing that I had a role as a science communicator. A few have tried valiantly, but the vast majority of doctors are just not even thinking about this. So there remains a huge gulf between the science and what the general public and politicians and business understand about what’s happening.”<br><br>Benn said she saw a growing activism in her profession, which is reflected in its academic literature. Last year more than 150 health workers wrote an open letter to the attorney general expressing concern about the prosecution of Trudi Warner for holding a sign outside Inner London crown court spelling out the right of a jury to acquit a defendant based on their conscience.<br><br>Benn and Hart still face criminal trials where they could lose their liberty, as well as their professional licence to practise.<br><br>“The truth of the matter is, [activism has] enhanced my ability to practise as a doctor,” said Hart. “It’s what’s meant I am able to continue to engage with my patients with a long-term view from a perspective of compassion and inter-generational healthcare. And it’s what’s allowed me to believe in healthcare as something of social value in a society which has a flourishing future ahead of it.”<br><br>Benn said: “I’m not a danger to the public in terms of patients. To me it all comes down to this one paragraph in [the GMC’s] Good Medical Practice, which says ‘you must make sure that your conduct justifies your patients’ trust in you and the public’s trust in the profession’. What constitutes public trust these days? I’m fascinated about how they’re going to argue this.”<br><br>This article was amended on 23 April 2024. An earlier version said Sarah Benn had spent 31 nights in jail; in fact it was 32.</p></td>

    <p>“There are lots of doctors who are politically active and have done stuff within social justice movements,” noted Benn. “But not, as far as I’m aware, that have ended up with criminal convictions which have then led to a tribunal to assess their fitness to practise.”<br><br>Benn has now retired and is no longer practising as a GP. But she wants the GMC to recognise the importance of her actions, and said doctors should be seen as “trusted messengers”.<br><br>Sign up to Down to Earth<br><br>The planet&#x27;s most important stories. Get all the week&#x27;s environment news - the good, the bad and the essential<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>“Humanity hasn’t faced this sort of existential crisis before that is going to have massive public health implications,” she said. “I’m really worried about my children’s future and my own, and all the people all over the world who are already starving, displaced and suffering right now because of what we’re continuing to do – digging up fossil fuels and burning them. And so penalising somebody who is trying to do something about that, that’s not how we need to go about it.”<br><br>At the very least, she hopes the GMC will develop guidance for the medical profession on activism, which she plans to stay involved in.<br><br>Hart does not believe most doctors appreciate their role at the frontlines of the climate crisis and in drawing public attention to it. He said: “I set out on this course believing that I had a role as a science communicator. A few have tried valiantly, but the vast majority of doctors are just not even thinking about this. So there remains a huge gulf between the science and what the general public and politicians and business understand about what’s happening.”<br><br>Benn said she saw a growing activism in her profession, which is reflected in its academic literature. Last year more than 150 health workers wrote an open letter to the attorney general expressing concern about the prosecution of Trudi Warner for holding a sign outside Inner London crown court spelling out the right of a jury to acquit a defendant based on their conscience.<br><br>Benn and Hart still face criminal trials where they could lose their liberty, as well as their professional licence to practise.<br><br>“The truth of the matter is, [activism has] enhanced my ability to practise as a doctor,” said Hart. “It’s what’s meant I am able to continue to engage with my patients with a long-term view from a perspective of compassion and inter-generational healthcare. And it’s what’s allowed me to believe in healthcare as something of social value in a society which has a flourishing future ahead of it.”<br><br>Benn said: “I’m not a danger to the public in terms of patients. To me it all comes down to this one paragraph in [the GMC’s] Good Medical Practice, which says ‘you must make sure that your conduct justifies your patients’ trust in you and the public’s trust in the profession’. What constitutes public trust these days? I’m fascinated about how they’re going to argue this.”<br><br>This article was amended on 23 April 2024. An earlier version said Sarah Benn had spent 31 nights in jail; in fact it was 32.</p></td>

The Doctors’ Association said: “Not all doctors subject to a custodial sentence having broken the law have been sanctioned by the MPTS.

A spokesperson said Benn received a five-month suspension because she consistently breached a court order, and her actions amounted to misconduct.<br><br>Benn’s case will be reviewed before the five-month suspension ends, when she could be struck off.

    <p><br><br>Will McCallum, a co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: &quot;This is a bolt of good news in an otherwise bleak landscape for protest rights. Our activists were facing a combined total of up to 15 years in prison for standing up to one of the world&#x27;s largest plastic polluters.&quot;<br><br>Greenpeace&#x27;s protest was part of a continuing campaign against Unilever after the company announced a major rollback of plastic reduction targets last year.<br><br>Climbers scaled the headquarters and attached a large artwork to the outside wall.

Six people were arrested, some wearing T-shirts with the slogan &quot;NO GOLF ON A DEAD PLANET&quot;.<br><br>The climate change protest disrupted the end of the PGA tournament as golfers Akshay Bhatia, Scottie Scheffler and Tom Kim were finishing their final round. Six protesters were tackled by police and arrested following the stunt on Sunday afternoon.<br><br>Bhatia said: &quot;I was scared for my life. I didn&#x27;t even really know what was happening. But thankfully the cops were there and kept us safe, because that&#x27;s, you know, that&#x27;s just weird stuff.&quot;<br><br>The protest caused a delay to play of around five minutes. The tournament was later won by Scheffler in a play-off.<br><br>The world number one praised the police response. He said officers &quot;got it taken care of pretty dang fast, and so we were very grateful for that&quot;.<br><br>Mr Scheffler added: &quot;When something like that happens, you don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s happening, so it can kind of rattle you a little bit. That can be a stressful situation, and you would hate for the tournament to end on something weird happening because of a situation like that.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Extinction Rebellion told the AP news agency: &quot;Golf, more than other events, is heavily reliant on good weather. Golf fans should therefore understand better than most the need for strong, immediate climate action.&quot;<br><br>Some of the crowd around the 18th green booed and shouted insults at the protesters during the incident. At one point they also chanted &quot;U-S-A&quot;.<br><br>The smoke bombs and powder left behind a white and red residue on the putting surface, which was cleaned up by groundstaff using leaf blowers.<br><br>Fellow golfer Kim said: &quot;They left a lot of marks on the greens, which is not right for us players - especially when two guys are trying to win a golf tournament.&quot;</p>

    </figure>
    <p>&#x27;In my judgment, it is not wrong to regard Dr Benn&#x27;s conduct in repeatedly breaching the injunction - to the extent she was imprisoned - and her stated intention to continue to act outside the law as being incompatible with her status as a member of the profession, whatever her motivations for that.<br><br>&#x27;The simple fact is that Dr Benn believes that it is appropriate to continue to take action that is unlawful to draw attention to her very real concerns about climate change. She minimises the impact of her actions on public resourcing.<br><br>&#x27;It was reasonable to allow Dr Benn the opportunity to reflect on the impact of her stated intent to continue her misconduct on her standing as a medical professional.<br><br>&#x27;Accordingly, I agree with the tribunal&#x27;s decision.&#x27;<br><br>Dr Benn ceased active clinical practice in 2022 but has remained on the medical register.<br><br>In a statement after the case,  Charlie Massey, Chief Executive of the GMC, said: &#x27;We note the High Court&#x27;s decision today to dismiss Dr Sarah Benn&#x27;s appeal against the five-month suspension imposed on her by a medical practitioners tribunal.<br><br>&#x27;In a balanced and considered judgment Mrs Justice Yip found that Dr Benn&#x27;s conduct did amount to misconduct and emphasised that it was this conduct, not her beliefs, that had brought her before a medical practitioners tribunal. The judgment concluded that in finding her fitness to practise impaired the tribunal had based their decision not merely on Dr Benn&#x27;s actions - which fell below the standards of personal conduct expected of a doctor - but also on her intention to continue breaking the law. The judge also agreed that a doctor&#x27;s status as a trusted professional is called into question if they not only break the law but refuse to be bound by the law.<br><br>&#x27;We agree that climate change is one of the greatest threats facing us all, particularly given the serious threat a changing climate poses to human health and wellbeing. Our guidance is clear that doctors, like all citizens, have a right to express their personal opinions on important issues like climate change, and there is nothing in our guidance that prevents them from exercising their right to lobby government and campaign - including taking part in protests. Our recently updated professional standards for all UK doctors, Good medical practice, also includes a new sustainability commitment, with a specific duty that all doctors should choose sustainable solutions.<br><br>&#x27;However, patients and the public have a high degree of trust in doctors, and that trust can be put at risk when doctors fail to comply with the law.&#x27;</p>

    <p>A NHS doctor who was suspended from her profession for taking part in climate protests with Just Stop Oil eco-zealots has today lost her appeal against the ruling.<br><br>Dr Sarah Benn was slapped with a five-month suspension by a medical practitioners tribunal after the watchdog found her activism had impaired her fitness to practice.<br><br>The &#x27;well-liked&#x27; family GP was jailed for 32 days in 2022 for breaching a court injunction when she took part in a protest outside the Kingsbury Oil Terminal in Warwickshire.<br><br>She was slammed when her suspension order was handed down in April last year for giving &#x27;no acknowledgement that what she has done was wrong&#x27;.<br><br>Now Dr Benn has failed in her appeal at the High Court against the ruling with a judge today throwing out her challenge.<br><br>Dr Benn had taken part in a number of Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil protests, starting in October 2019, and from 2022 has taken part in a series of demonstrations outside the Kingsbury Oil Terminal, in Warwickshire.<br><br>A High Court injunction had banned such protests and she was arrested several times for &#x27;deliberate contravention of the injunction&#x27;.<br><br>It ended up with her being handed a 32 day jail term in September 2022, but despite spending time behind bars she vowed to continue her activism.<br><br>A medical practitioners tribunal, which makes decisions about the fitness to practice of medics in the UK, went on to find her actions had amounted to misconduct and rule that her fitness to practice was impaired because of her climate activism.<br><br>Dr Benn, from Birmingham, West Midlands, claimed her actions were part of a doctor&#x27;s &#x27;fundamental duty is to protect health and life&#x27;.<br><br>But she was handed a five-month suspension from the medical register in April last year.<br><br>She went on to appeal against that ruling to the High Court, relying as part of her evidence on a survey signed by more than 1,000 doctors and other healthcare professionals.<br><br>It showed that &#x27;95% of participants felt that Dr Benn&#x27;s actions did not undermine the public&#x27;s trust in doctors and 96% disagreed with the conclusion that her fitness to practise was impaired&#x27;.<br><br>But Mrs Justice Yip, ruling on the case, today threw out the doctor&#x27;s challenge, saying the medical practitioners tribunal was not wrong to find that Dr Benn&#x27;s continued commitment to potentially illegal climate protest amounted to misconduct.<br><br>The judge said the medical practitioners tribunal&#x27;s finding that they saw Dr Benn&#x27;s &#x27;stated intention to continue to act outside the law as being incompatible with her status as a member of the profession&#x27; could not be legitimately challenged.<br><br>Going on to say that the ruling of misconduct and sanction could not be challenged, the judge concluded: &#x27;The finding that Dr Benn&#x27;s fitness to practise was impaired was not based merely on historical wrongdoing which fell below the standards of personal conduct expected of a doctor, but also took account of Dr Benn&#x27;s stated intention to continue to behave in the same way.</p>

      <figcaption align="center">Dr Benn arrives at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester - April, 2024</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>&#x27;In my judgment, it is not wrong to regard Dr Benn&#x27;s conduct in repeatedly breaching the injunction - to the extent she was imprisoned - and her stated intention to continue to act outside the law as being incompatible with her status as a member of the profession, whatever her motivations for that.<br><br>&#x27;The simple fact is that Dr Benn believes that it is appropriate to continue to take action that is unlawful to draw attention to her very real concerns about climate change. She minimises the impact of her actions on public resourcing.<br><br>&#x27;It was reasonable to allow Dr Benn the opportunity to reflect on the impact of her stated intent to continue her misconduct on her standing as a medical professional.<br><br>&#x27;Accordingly, I agree with the tribunal&#x27;s decision.&#x27;<br><br>Dr Benn ceased active clinical practice in 2022 but has remained on the medical register.<br><br>In a statement after the case,  Charlie Massey, Chief Executive of the GMC, said: &#x27;We note the High Court&#x27;s decision today to dismiss Dr Sarah Benn&#x27;s appeal against the five-month suspension imposed on her by a medical practitioners tribunal.<br><br>&#x27;In a balanced and considered judgment Mrs Justice Yip found that Dr Benn&#x27;s conduct did amount to misconduct and emphasised that it was this conduct, not her beliefs, that had brought her before a medical practitioners tribunal. The judgment concluded that in finding her fitness to practise impaired the tribunal had based their decision not merely on Dr Benn&#x27;s actions - which fell below the standards of personal conduct expected of a doctor - but also on her intention to continue breaking the law. The judge also agreed that a doctor&#x27;s status as a trusted professional is called into question if they not only break the law but refuse to be bound by the law.<br><br>&#x27;We agree that climate change is one of the greatest threats facing us all, particularly given the serious threat a changing climate poses to human health and wellbeing. Our guidance is clear that doctors, like all citizens, have a right to express their personal opinions on important issues like climate change, and there is nothing in our guidance that prevents them from exercising their right to lobby government and campaign - including taking part in protests. Our recently updated professional standards for all UK doctors, Good medical practice, also includes a new sustainability commitment, with a specific duty that all doctors should choose sustainable solutions.<br><br>&#x27;However, patients and the public have a high degree of trust in doctors, and that trust can be put at risk when doctors fail to comply with the law.&#x27;</p>

They can censor us, but they cannot censor reality,&#x27; the Italian branch of Last Generation wrote on X.<br><br>On a fundraising page to cover &#x27;legal fees, travel and accommodation costs&#x27; for their activists, Last Generation reacted to the new law by writing: &#x27;Despite the &quot;ecoprotest&quot; law, despite precautionary measures, despite increasingly grotesque oppression, we do not stop and continue to take actions.<br><br>&#x27;We continue because there is no justice for the victims of landslides and floods [...].<br><br>&#x27;We demand that the government takes responsibility for caring for the victims of these disasters [in Campi Bisenzio and Emilia-Romagna].

    <p>However, other stunts have provoked more angry reactions from the public.<br><br>Also last year, climate activists waded into the waters of Rome&#x27;s world-famous Trevi Fountain and poured in a black liquid to symbolise oil.<br><br>&#x27;Our country is dying,&#x27; they shouted after unfurling a banner, as tourists visiting the monument took photos, cheered and booed.<br><br>While the group said the liquid was carbon based and would not damage the fountain, Rome&#x27;s mayor said regardless, the city would have to throw away the 300,000 litres of water circulating the Trevi Fountain and replace it.<br><br>The group has also hurled paint at Milan&#x27;s famous La Scala opera house, food at the glass protecting iconic paintings, and sprayed the Italian Senate with orange paint.<br><br>Its members have also blocked traffic, infuriating motorists.<br><br>Several videos have shown the activists sitting across the middle of busy roads, causing long traffic jams during morning and afternoon rush hours.<br><br>This has invariably led to members of the public taking matters into their own hands, ripping banners out of the activists&#x27; hands and dragging them off the road.<br><br>In October irate motorists repeatedly kicked and dragged climate protesters blocking traffic in Milan.<br><br>Around 20 &#x27;Ultima Generazione&#x27; - translated as Last Generation - activists blocked a road, drawing the anger of several drivers left stuck in the resulting traffic.<br><br>Footage showed several activists sitting on a crossing point over the multi-lane road at a busy intersection, causing chaos for drivers during rush hour by linking hands and holding up an orange climate emergency banner.<br><br>Several drivers, furious at the protesters for blocking their way, got out of the cars and banded together to carry them off the road in shocking scenes caught on video.<br><br>Other climate activist groups have also been active in Italy.<br><br>In December, protesters from Extinction Rebellion used a dye to turn Venice&#x27;s famous Grand Canal green, in protest over what they said at the time was a lack of progress at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai .<br><br>Activists from the group were seen dangling from the Rialto Bridge over the canal with the aid of hard hats and climbing ropes, while displaying a banner that read: &#x27;COP28: While the government talks, we are hanging by a thread.&#x27;<br><br>And in 2022, Italian eco-zealots glued their hands to Botticelli&#x27;s masterpiece Primavera at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.<br><br>But in November, a judge in Florence ruled two activists who in 2022 glued their hands to the glass surrounding another Botticelli painting, also in the Uffizi, had not committed a crime.<br><br>That same year, 11 activists threw flour over a car painted by Andy Warhol that was on display in Milan&#x27;s Fabbrica del Vapore art centre.<br><br>Groups in the UK, like Just Stop Oil, have employed similar tactics in recent years.<br><br>In one instance, an activist cable-tied himself to the goal posts during a football match at Everton FC&#x27;s Goodison Park, provoking an angry reaction from the crowd.</p>

        <h1>Prevent: Rise in climate activists referred to anti-terror scheme</h1><p>The number of climate activists referred to the Prevent anti-terrorism programme has increased following the emergence of disruptive environmental protests, the BBC has learned.<br><br>The UK government&#x27;s Prevent scheme aims to stop people becoming terrorists.<br><br>Critics say Prevent curbs human rights by stifling non-violent political beliefs and should be reformed.<br><br>The government says it has never advised referring people to Prevent for lawful climate activism or protest.<br><br>Anyone can contact the police or a local authority to make a Prevent referral, which usually involves filling out a form to explain a concern about someone deemed to be at risk of radicalisation.<br><br>Since 2015, institutions including schools, universities, hospitals, local authorities, police, and prisons have had a legal duty to consider the risk of radicalisation.<br><br>The Home Office told the BBC Prevent interventions were legitimate for those who could be radicalised into terrorism in the name of environmental causes.<br><br>But climate activists say the government&#x27;s definition of extremism is too broad and authorities are confusing extremism with non-violent civil disobedience in too many cases.<br><br>Sir Peter Fahy, a former national police lead for Prevent, said it was &quot;inappropriate&quot; to treat non-violent climate activists as potential terrorists.<br><br>He said the fear of being flagged to police in a Prevent referral could deter people from protesting, and argued the rise in environmental cases reasons &quot;shows how confused we&#x27;ve become about all of this&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Prevent has been and should be about people who want to take their extremism into violent action,&quot; Sir Peter said.<br><br>Prevent has mainly focused on Islamist and far-right terrorism but it does try to counter other types of extremism.<br><br>The government groups &quot;eco-terrorism&quot; in a category of violent extremism motivated by ideas on &quot;the extreme political left-wing&quot;.<br><br>It says although this category does not represent a significant threat, some activity has met a terrorist threshold in recent years and security services continue to investigate such cases.<br><br>There have been &quot;a small number of instances of terrorist behaviour that have been motivated by an environmentalist ideology&quot;, the Home Office said.<br><br>In response to a freedom of information request, the UK&#x27;s police chiefs told the BBC there were 32 Prevent referrals for &quot;Left Wing - Environmental&quot; reasons between 2015 and 2022.<br><br>There was a notable spike in referrals in 2019, when Extinction Rebellion - a climate group known for its disruptive protests - came to prominence with large demonstrations in the UK and internationally.<br><br>The BBC has spoken to one climate activist who was assessed by Prevent. They said they did not wish to be named in this report because they feared they would lose their job.<br><br>The climate activist was referred to Prevent by their employer after being arrested at an Extinction Rebellion protest. The person has been cautioned by police and convicted for public order offences committed at disruptive environmental protests.<br><br>The BBC has seen a copy of the form used to refer the climate activist to Prevent. The form says they were referred &quot;due to being a member of Extinction Rebellion and other splinter groups&quot;.<br><br>The form says the groups &quot;are not considered extreme in themselves, but individuals within them may hold extremist views&quot;.<br><br>The climate activist was assessed by a multi-agency safeguarding team and they said no further action was taken.<br><br>When people are referred to Prevent, the police decide whether or not they need more comprehensive intervention through a process called Channel.<br><br>The Home Office said there were fewer than 10 referrals for environmental reasons each year between 2015 and 2022, but refused to release specific figures, citing safety and privacy concerns.<br><br>The number of Prevent referrals adopted as Channel cases for all reasons is relatively small every year, representing 9% of the total in 2022-23.<br><br>A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;Lawful protest or activism does not meet the threshold for Prevent referrals and at no point has the government advised referring people simply for climate activism.</p>

    <p>&quot;Prevent is an early intervention programme which seeks to stop people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism, regardless of the ideology. If a person is not at risk of radicalisation then their case will be closed to Prevent.&quot;<br><br>A controversial strand of the UK&#x27;s counter-terrorism strategy, Prevent was set up by Tony Blair&#x27;s government in the 2003 following the 9/11 attacks.<br><br>A key moment in its evolution came in 2015, with the introduction of the legal duty on schools and other institutions to report those deemed at risk of radicalisation.<br><br>Human rights activists have long accused Prevent of demonising Muslims, and having a chilling effect on freedom of expression.<br><br>Earlier this year, Amnesty International urged the UK government to scrap the Prevent duty in a report condemning its impact on human rights.<br><br>&quot;People are being referred to Prevent for non-violent political beliefs,&quot; said Ilyas Nagdee, Amnesty International UK&#x27;s racial justice director.<br><br>But Lord Carlile, who reviewed the scheme for the government in 2011, said environmental protesters who &quot;presented as potentially violent extremists are properly referable to Prevent&quot;.<br><br>He said there was a &quot;superficiality to analysis based on numbers and on descriptions as brief as &#x27;environmental activist&#x27; without looking at the context&quot; of each referral.<br><br>Lord Carlile said while the programme could be improved, he did not agree with those who argued it should be scrapped because &quot;some environmental activists were allegedly drawn into Prevent&quot;.<br><br>He said counter-terrorism was &quot;not science&quot; and &quot;the police have a very difficult job&quot;, arguing: &quot;You can&#x27;t just write off Prevent because there have been some mistakes, any more than you can write off the police for arresting people who later are not charged.&quot;<br><br>Most referrals to Prevent are made in the education sector, where training to understand the risk of radicalisation is encouraged.<br><br>In its Prevent report, Amnesty found some training materials listed environmental causes &quot;as potential forms of an ill-defined extremism that can lead to a referral&quot;.<br><br>Mat Osmond, who&#x27;s a senior lecturer at Falmouth University in Cornwall, told the BBC his employer asked him to re-take Prevent training after he helped to organise a student Just Stop Oil talk on campus last year.<br><br>He accepted he did not follow the university&#x27;s Prevent procedures when booking a room.<br><br>He said the training was about &quot;spotting the signs of radicalisation in students&quot; and had no relevance to room-booking procedures at his university.<br><br>Outside work, Mr Osmond has been involved in climate activism himself.<br><br>In October this year, he was found guilty of obstructing a road as part of a Just Stop Oil protest in London and was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge.<br><br>When asked if he regretted his actions, Mr Osmond said he found obstructing &quot;random fellow citizens&quot; a &quot;deeply uncomfortable&quot; thing to do.<br><br>But he said he would make &quot;a categorical distinction between being drawn into violent extremism&quot; and &quot;taking action with non-violent resistance campaigns&quot;.<br><br>David Knowles echoed this distinction.<br><br>A former Prevent national lead within education, he had a significant role in the introduction of the legal duty in 2015.<br><br>He said he didn&#x27;t come across any environmental extremism when he was working in counter-terrorism.<br><br>Mr Knowles said: &quot;Breaking the law doesn&#x27;t mean you oppose democracy or the rule of law because, let&#x27;s face it, lots of people in this country have protested and successfully changed the law.<br><br>&quot;So people who might glue themselves to the road, to me, are not extremists.&quot;<br><br>But he said Prevent was a vital part of the UK&#x27;s counter-terrorism strategy and should be allowed to continue to protect people &quot;from all forms of harm and risk&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Prevent is about safeguarding people away from extremism and terrorism, and it&#x27;s not about supressing free speech at all,&quot; Mr Knowles said.</p></td>

        <h1>Prevent: Rise in climate activists referred to anti-terror scheme</h1><p>The number of climate activists referred to the Prevent anti-terrorism programme has increased following the emergence of disruptive environmental protests, the BBC has learned.<br><br>The UK government&#x27;s Prevent scheme aims to stop people becoming terrorists.<br><br>Critics say Prevent curbs human rights by stifling non-violent political beliefs and should be reformed.<br><br>The government says it has never advised referring people to Prevent for lawful climate activism or protest.<br><br>Anyone can contact the police or a local authority to make a Prevent referral, which usually involves filling out a form to explain a concern about someone deemed to be at risk of radicalisation.<br><br>Since 2015, institutions including schools, universities, hospitals, local authorities, police, and prisons have had a legal duty to consider the risk of radicalisation.<br><br>The Home Office told the BBC Prevent interventions were legitimate for those who could be radicalised into terrorism in the name of environmental causes.<br><br>But climate activists say the government&#x27;s definition of extremism is too broad and authorities are confusing extremism with non-violent civil disobedience in too many cases.<br><br>Sir Peter Fahy, a former national police lead for Prevent, said it was &quot;inappropriate&quot; to treat non-violent climate activists as potential terrorists.<br><br>He said the fear of being flagged to police in a Prevent referral could deter people from protesting, and argued the rise in environmental cases reasons &quot;shows how confused we&#x27;ve become about all of this&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Prevent has been and should be about people who want to take their extremism into violent action,&quot; Sir Peter said.<br><br>Prevent has mainly focused on Islamist and far-right terrorism but it does try to counter other types of extremism.<br><br>The government groups &quot;eco-terrorism&quot; in a category of violent extremism motivated by ideas on &quot;the extreme political left-wing&quot;.<br><br>It says although this category does not represent a significant threat, some activity has met a terrorist threshold in recent years and security services continue to investigate such cases.<br><br>There have been &quot;a small number of instances of terrorist behaviour that have been motivated by an environmentalist ideology&quot;, the Home Office said.<br><br>In response to a freedom of information request, the UK&#x27;s police chiefs told the BBC there were 32 Prevent referrals for &quot;Left Wing - Environmental&quot; reasons between 2015 and 2022.<br><br>There was a notable spike in referrals in 2019, when Extinction Rebellion - a climate group known for its disruptive protests - came to prominence with large demonstrations in the UK and internationally.<br><br>The BBC has spoken to one climate activist who was assessed by Prevent. They said they did not wish to be named in this report because they feared they would lose their job.<br><br>The climate activist was referred to Prevent by their employer after being arrested at an Extinction Rebellion protest. The person has been cautioned by police and convicted for public order offences committed at disruptive environmental protests.<br><br>The BBC has seen a copy of the form used to refer the climate activist to Prevent. The form says they were referred &quot;due to being a member of Extinction Rebellion and other splinter groups&quot;.<br><br>The form says the groups &quot;are not considered extreme in themselves, but individuals within them may hold extremist views&quot;.<br><br>The climate activist was assessed by a multi-agency safeguarding team and they said no further action was taken.<br><br>When people are referred to Prevent, the police decide whether or not they need more comprehensive intervention through a process called Channel.<br><br>The Home Office said there were fewer than 10 referrals for environmental reasons each year between 2015 and 2022, but refused to release specific figures, citing safety and privacy concerns.<br><br>The number of Prevent referrals adopted as Channel cases for all reasons is relatively small every year, representing 9% of the total in 2022-23.<br><br>A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;Lawful protest or activism does not meet the threshold for Prevent referrals and at no point has the government advised referring people simply for climate activism.</p>

    <p>&quot;Prevent is an early intervention programme which seeks to stop people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism, regardless of the ideology. If a person is not at risk of radicalisation then their case will be closed to Prevent.&quot;<br><br>A controversial strand of the UK&#x27;s counter-terrorism strategy, Prevent was set up by Tony Blair&#x27;s government in the 2003 following the 9/11 attacks.<br><br>A key moment in its evolution came in 2015, with the introduction of the legal duty on schools and other institutions to report those deemed at risk of radicalisation.<br><br>Human rights activists have long accused Prevent of demonising Muslims, and having a chilling effect on freedom of expression.<br><br>Earlier this year, Amnesty International urged the UK government to scrap the Prevent duty in a report condemning its impact on human rights.<br><br>&quot;People are being referred to Prevent for non-violent political beliefs,&quot; said Ilyas Nagdee, Amnesty International UK&#x27;s racial justice director.<br><br>But Lord Carlile, who reviewed the scheme for the government in 2011, said environmental protesters who &quot;presented as potentially violent extremists are properly referable to Prevent&quot;.<br><br>He said there was a &quot;superficiality to analysis based on numbers and on descriptions as brief as &#x27;environmental activist&#x27; without looking at the context&quot; of each referral.<br><br>Lord Carlile said while the programme could be improved, he did not agree with those who argued it should be scrapped because &quot;some environmental activists were allegedly drawn into Prevent&quot;.<br><br>He said counter-terrorism was &quot;not science&quot; and &quot;the police have a very difficult job&quot;, arguing: &quot;You can&#x27;t just write off Prevent because there have been some mistakes, any more than you can write off the police for arresting people who later are not charged.&quot;<br><br>Most referrals to Prevent are made in the education sector, where training to understand the risk of radicalisation is encouraged.<br><br>In its Prevent report, Amnesty found some training materials listed environmental causes &quot;as potential forms of an ill-defined extremism that can lead to a referral&quot;.<br><br>Mat Osmond, who&#x27;s a senior lecturer at Falmouth University in Cornwall, told the BBC his employer asked him to re-take Prevent training after he helped to organise a student Just Stop Oil talk on campus last year.<br><br>He accepted he did not follow the university&#x27;s Prevent procedures when booking a room.<br><br>He said the training was about &quot;spotting the signs of radicalisation in students&quot; and had no relevance to room-booking procedures at his university.<br><br>Outside work, Mr Osmond has been involved in climate activism himself.<br><br>In October this year, he was found guilty of obstructing a road as part of a Just Stop Oil protest in London and was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge.<br><br>When asked if he regretted his actions, Mr Osmond said he found obstructing &quot;random fellow citizens&quot; a &quot;deeply uncomfortable&quot; thing to do.<br><br>But he said he would make &quot;a categorical distinction between being drawn into violent extremism&quot; and &quot;taking action with non-violent resistance campaigns&quot;.<br><br>David Knowles echoed this distinction.<br><br>A former Prevent national lead within education, he had a significant role in the introduction of the legal duty in 2015.<br><br>He said he didn&#x27;t come across any environmental extremism when he was working in counter-terrorism.<br><br>Mr Knowles said: &quot;Breaking the law doesn&#x27;t mean you oppose democracy or the rule of law because, let&#x27;s face it, lots of people in this country have protested and successfully changed the law.<br><br>&quot;So people who might glue themselves to the road, to me, are not extremists.&quot;<br><br>But he said Prevent was a vital part of the UK&#x27;s counter-terrorism strategy and should be allowed to continue to protect people &quot;from all forms of harm and risk&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Prevent is about safeguarding people away from extremism and terrorism, and it&#x27;s not about supressing free speech at all,&quot; Mr Knowles said.</p></td>

    <p>Experts warn victory for Energy Transfer, whose CEO is a Trump donor, could have a ‘chilling’ effect on free speech<br><br>A fossil fuel company’s $300m lawsuit against Greenpeace opens in rural North Dakota on Monday, in a case that has been widely condemned by constitutional rights experts as baseless, bad faith litigation that threatens free speech.<br><br>Energy Transfer Partners, a Dallas-based oil and gas company worth almost $70bn, accuses Greenpeace of defamation and orchestrating criminal behavior by protesters at the Dakota Access pipeline (Dapl).<br><br>The anti-pipeline protests in 2016 and 2017 were organised by Standing Rock and other Sioux tribes and supported by more than 300 sovereign tribal nations, inspiring an international solidarity movement after Energy Transfer’s private security unleashed attack dogs and pepper spray against nonviolent protesters.<br><br>Tens of thousands of people from across the country and world participated in the Dapl protests, and Greenpeace was among scores of non-profit groups that supported the Standing Rock tribe’s opposition to the pipeline.<br><br>But Energy Transfer alleges in court filings that thousands of protestors were “incited” to come to North Dakota thanks to a “misinformation campaign” by Greenpeace.<br><br>The lawsuit has been widely denounced as a classic strategic lawsuit against public participation (Slapp) – a form of civil litigation increasingly deployed by corporations, politicians and wealthy individuals to deliberately wear down and silence critics including journalists, activists and watchdog groups.<br><br>The case threatens to bankrupt Greenpeace US, but the biggest impact could be a chilling effect on free speech and activism more broadly, according to environmental and civil liberty experts consulted by the Guardian. The five-week jury trial is scheduled to start on 24 February in Mandan, Morton county.<br><br>“This case is an emblematic example of a Slapp lawsuit – a way of weaponizing the legal system by wealthy and powerful people to silence their critics by dragging them through long, stressful, expensive litigation where winning is almost irrelevant,” said Kirk Herbertson, a New York attorney and the US director for advocacy and campaigns for EarthRights International.<br><br>“This was not a Greenpeace event. They were not controlling what the people coming in were doing … there is nothing in the court filings that show Energy Transfer suffered actual harm due to actions by Greenpeace,” added Herbertson. “This case feels more like a trophy hunt and an attempt to shut down free speech rather than an actual good faith attempt to seek remedies for harm.”<br><br>Energy Transfer first filed a Rico lawsuit in 2017 alleging federal racketeering and state tort claims. At the time Kelcy Warren, the company’s billionaire founder and a major donor to Donald Trump, told CNBC that the company was “greatly harmed” by Greenpeace.<br><br>“Everybody’s afraid of these environmental groups and the fear that if you fight back it may look wrong … but what they did to us is wrong and they’re going to pay for it,” said Warren. Warren has previously said environmental activists should be “removed from the gene pool” and a Wall Street Journal profile of him detailed his relentless pursuit against green groups.<br><br>The federal racketeering case was dismissed on 14 February 2019, but seven days later Energy Transfer re-filed a virtually identical suit in North Dakota state court. Energy Transfer is suing three Greenpeace entities, claiming that they are a single organization rather than independent members of the Greenpeace network.<br><br>After six years and thousands of filings, this will be the first case under the new Trump administration to test what the first amendment will look like.<br><br>The lawsuit centres around nine statements made by Greenpeace during the Indigenous-led protests – none of which were original to the group, while three were taken from two letters written by another organization, including one with more than 500 signatories. Greenpeace argues that the statements are legitimate expressions of the first amendment protected right to speech.<br><br>Energy Transfer is also seeking to hold Greenpeace liable for actions taken by protesters that have no proven connection to the group.<br><br>“Greenpeace is a great big target. If you’re trying to send a message to the world, go after Greenpeace,” said James Wheaton, a longtime journalism law professor at Stanford and UC Berkeley who founded the First Amendment Project. “The pipeline lawsuit is a classic Slapp suit.<br><br>More than 330,000 individuals and 430+ organizations including Amnesty International, the American Federation of Teachers and Indigenous Environmental Network have signed an open letter denouncing the lawsuit as meritless – and an attempt to rewrite history by claiming that Greenpeace orchestrated what was an Indigenous-led movement.<br><br>The Standing Rock tribe has always asserted that the pipeline is a violation of its sovereignty as it crosses unceded historical and sacred Sioux territorial lands. The tribe wants a federal court to shut down the pipeline, and in October filed a lawsuit accusing the army corps of engineers of unlawfully allowing it to operate without an easement, a complete environmental assessment or sufficient emergency spill response plans.<br><br>“The tribe was 100% responsible and autonomous in their decision making and how they protested … this Energy Transfer lawsuit is aimed at creating a mortal blow through the legal system to a legacy non-profit that has done some of the most important environmental protection advocacy in US history,” said Scott Wilson Badenoch, a former chair of the American Bar Association’s Environmental Justice Committee and veteran international trial monitor.<br><br>He added: “It is utterly clear that Slapp suits are bad faith to their very core … the venue choice in this case is obviously part of what makes it a Slapp. The jury pool seems to be impossibly tainted … We’ve been involved with trial monitoring in places like Cambodia and Ecuador that were easier to monitor than this case in the United States of America.”<br><br>Badenoch is among a team of independent prominent civil rights attorneys and advocates who will monitor the trial amid growing concerns about judicial bias and violations of due process – and the threat posed by the case to free speech and the right to protest.</p>

    <p>Judge James Gion was assigned to the case from another North Dakota jurisdiction after every single judge in Morton county recused themselves due to conflicts. Yet the judge has denied requests from Greenpeace’s legal team to move the case to a different court due to concerns about potential jury bias. In 2024, 75% of voters in Morton county backed Trump. During his first term, Trump ordered an expedited review of the Dapl project after it was hit with obstacles by the Obama administration.<br><br>Another concern for the independent committee of observers is the size of the courtroom, which has very limited seating. Gion denied a motion from Greenpeace to livestream proceedings, ruling that this would interfere with Energy Transfer’s “right to a fair trial”. A key pretrial hearing on 4 February was held online without public access. Yet the court in Morton county has previously permitted Court TV to livestream homicide trials. A request by the trial monitoring committee for live streaming was also denied.<br><br>In recent weeks, mysterious rightwing mailers have arrived at the homes of local residents that Greenpeace alleges could further taint the jury pool. The mailers, made to look like a newspaper and dubbed “Central ND News,” contain articles slanted against the pipeline protest or in favor of Energy Transfer, among stories about immigration and community news. None of the articles have named bylines. A publisher’s note in a January edition similarly is not signed with a name but instead by “Central ND Times Publishers.”<br><br>The stories within the mailer slant in favor of fossil fuels. One article in the January edition, next to a chart of gas prices around the state, is an interview of a former protestor who now says she believes the protestors created “a local ecological disaster” and approves of the pipeline. A February edition features a business leader who claims the protests primarily caused “division”.<br><br>Greenpeace sought to investigate whether the mailers were paid for, directly or indirectly, by Energy Transfer, but the judge denied its request for discovery on the issue. Warren, the Energy Transfer CEO, made a donation to a political action committee that then paid a publishing company affiliated with the group behind the mailer, ExxonKnews reported in December.<br><br>The judge has also allowed Energy Transfer to seal thousands of pages of evidence that appear to include details of the pipeline’s safety history. The Standing Rock tribe’s opposition to the pipeline is in part due to the risk posed by leaks in Lake Oahe, the primary source of water for the community. The company, which operates in 44 states, has a chequered environmental health and safety record, and was responsible for the worst pipeline fuel leaks in 2024.<br><br>On Tuesday, the judge denied all the motions for summary judgments filed by Greenpeace’s attorneys in April 2024, and argued last June. Greenpeace is represented by Davis Wright Tremaine, a firm known for representing first amendment cases.<br><br>An Energy Transfer spokesperson said: “Our lawsuit against Greenpeace is not about free speech as they are trying to claim. It is about them not following the law. We support the rights of all Americans to express their opinions and lawfully protest. However, when it is not done in accordance with our laws, we have a legal system to deal with that. Beyond that we will let our case speak for itself.”<br><br>Energy Transfer is represented by Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher – the firm that represented Chevron against Steven Donziger, the environmental advocate sued by the firm after helping Amazonian communities in Ecuador win a landmark pollution case. “This appears to be part of a broader strategy by the fossil fuel industry to weaponize the courts against activists and weaken organizations like Greenpeace in retaliation for their advocacy,” said Donziger, a member of the trial monitoring committee.<br><br>The monitoring team also includes Marty Garbus, who has represented numerous high-profile figures such as Leonard Peltier and Nelson Mandela; Indigenous rights lawyer Natali Segovia of the Water Protector Legal Collective; and Jeanne Mirer, president of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.<br><br>Slapps and related legal tactics are being increasingly used globally to silence environmental and social justice activists, especially by fossil fuel corporations and the ultra-wealthy.<br><br>Warren previously issued a Slapp lawsuit against Texas lawmaker Beto O’Rourke after he critiqued Warren’s massive profits during the 2021 Texas winter storm. (The case was dismissed.) Trump has filed almost 4,100 lawsuits over the past three decades, including seven defamation suits as a private citizen.<br><br>“We are generally used to seeing government as the biggest threat to free speech. But in an era of massive, massive wealth inequality, it’s not that surprising to see a trend of using money to suppress speech and kind of control democratic processes,” said Shayana “Shane” Kadidal, senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights.<br><br>Earlier this month Greenpeace International filed a lawsuit in a Dutch court to recover “all damages and costs it has suffered as a result of ET’s back-to-back, meritless lawsuits”. This is the first test of a new European law aimed at curbing malicious lawsuits intended to silence journalists, rights activists and public watchdogs. In the US, two bipartisan efforts to pass federal anti-Slapp legislation have not gone anywhere.<br><br>“This lawsuit is an attempt to divide the movement, but it has not been successful,” said Deepa Padmanabha, Greenpeace’s senior legal adviser. “Energy Transfer and the fossil fuel industry do not understand the difference between entities and movements. You can’t bankrupt the movement. You can’t silence the movement. There will be a backlash and a price to pay when you pursue these kinds of tactics. People power is more powerful.”</p>

Beyond that we will let our case speak for itself.”<br><br>Energy Transfer is represented by Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher – the firm that represented Chevron against Steven Donziger, the environmental advocate sued by the firm after helping Amazonian communities in Ecuador win a landmark pollution case. “This appears to be part of a broader strategy by the fossil fuel industry to weaponize the courts against activists and weaken organizations like Greenpeace in retaliation for their advocacy,” said Donziger, a member of the trial monitoring committee.<br><br>The monitoring team also includes Marty Garbus, who has represented numerous high-profile figures such as Leonard Peltier and Nelson Mandela; Indigenous rights lawyer Natali Segovia of the Water Protector Legal Collective; and Jeanne Mirer, president of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.<br><br>Slapps and related legal tactics are being increasingly used globally to silence environmental and social justice activists, especially by fossil fuel corporations and the ultra-wealthy.<br><br>Warren previously issued a Slapp lawsuit against Texas lawmaker Beto O’Rourke after he critiqued Warren’s massive profits during the 2021 Texas winter storm. (The case was dismissed.) Trump has filed almost 4,100 lawsuits over the past three decades, including seven defamation suits as a private citizen.<br><br>“We are generally used to seeing government as the biggest threat to free speech. But in an era of massive, massive wealth inequality, it’s not that surprising to see a trend of using money to suppress speech and kind of control democratic processes,” said Shayana “Shane” Kadidal, senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights.<br><br>Earlier this month Greenpeace International filed a lawsuit in a Dutch court to recover “all damages and costs it has suffered as a result of ET’s back-to-back, meritless lawsuits”. This is the first test of a new European law aimed at curbing malicious lawsuits intended to silence journalists, rights activists and public watchdogs. In the US, two bipartisan efforts to pass federal anti-Slapp legislation have not gone anywhere.<br><br>“This lawsuit is an attempt to divide the movement, but it has not been successful,” said Deepa Padmanabha, Greenpeace’s senior legal adviser. “Energy Transfer and the fossil fuel industry do not understand the difference between entities and movements. You can’t bankrupt the movement. You can’t silence the movement. There will be a backlash and a price to pay when you pursue these kinds of tactics. People power is more powerful.”</p>

        <h1>Police fear Just Stop Oil jail sentences will spark more protests</h1><h2>The record term for Roger Hallam could serve as a ‘rallying call’, says the detective who led the investigation into his plot to bring the M25 to a standstill</h2><p>The record jail sentence for the co-founder of Just Stop Oil could serve as a “rallying call” to other climate activists for a wave of protests, police believe.<br><br>Roger Hallam, 58, was jailed for five years on Thursday for orchestrating protests that disrupted the M25 over four days in November 2022 when 45 protesters climbed gantries on various parts of the motorway, forcing police to stop traffic.<br><br>Daniel Shaw, 38, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, Louise Lancaster, 58, and Cressida Gethin, 22, were each given four years after being found guilty along with Hallam of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.<br><br>The sentences, handed down by Judge Christopher Hehir, are thought to be the longest ever given for peaceful protest and have been widely criticised.<br><br>The prime minister is facing calls to repeal the raft of anti-protest laws that were introduced by the Conservatives over the past two years.<br><br>Detective Inspector Chris Rudd, who led the investigation, said there were “certainly signals from the [activist] groups” that they intended to stage a protest in retaliation to the sentences.<br><br>He told The Times: “The judge commented upon sentencing that he hoped it may have some deterrent effect on others that wanted to cause serious disruption to members of the public. I do hope it does have some deterrent effect. But for some, it might be a rallying call.”<br><br>The five ­Just Stop Oil activists were recorded by an undercover reporter for The Sun during a Zoom call in which they discussed the planned ­protests and were aiming to recruit others.<br><br>They were sentenced under legislation introduced by the previous government to get tougher on disruptive tactics used by ­environmental protesters, including blocking roads and attacks on sporting events. A United Nations human rights commissioner condemned the measures as “deeply troubling” and “disproportionate”.<br><br>Rudd, who oversees most environmental protests in London, said the protesters were known to police before the covert recording. “There is mention of this being a simple Zoom call resulting in people ending up in prison for five years, but to be absolutely clear: the call contained compelling evidence of them engaging in a plan to conduct what is criminal activity. They wanted to cause absolute gridlock and chaos.”<br><br>During the trial, Metropolitan Police officers were stationed at court to deal with disruption from the defendants.</p><p>Rudd said less than 10 per cent of Just Stop Oil activists who appear in court plead guilty, compared with about 50 per cent in groups such as Extinction Rebellion, whose members followed the “longstanding tradition” of protesters “taking [punishment] on the chin”.<br><br>He added: “Most [Just Stop Oil activists] will self-represent at trial, making the trial process much longer. And as we’ve seen recently, make the trial itself a protest ground.”<br><br>The court was told that the M25 protests delayed more than 700,000 vehicles and caused economic damage of £765,000, and the cost to the Met was more than £1.1 million.<br><br>Hallam and the others will not qualify for early release after 40 per cent of their time is served as the emergency scheme is only in place for 18 months and will expire before they qualify.<br><br>• Labour announces early release for 5,500 prisoners<br><br>Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the former justice secretary and lord chancellor, has said the sentences make him feel “very uncomfortable”.<br><br>He said: “I am not criticising the judge because I am sure the judge is going with whatever the sentencing guidelines are. But these are people who are not violent criminals.<br><br>“They cause enormous irritation to a large number of people. However, to be sentencing people to four and five years in prison for that is maybe an indication as to why the prisons are so full. Maybe prison was appropriate, I don’t dispute that — but for that length of time, I feel uncomfortable at that. But there can be an appeal.”<br><br>John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said: “Post Office destroys lives, water companies pollute our rivers, [the Criminal Cases Review Commission] leaves innocent people to rot in prison, Covid ministers’ incompetence costs thousands of lives, but nobody is punished. Stop traffic on M25 and get five years in prison. This is brutally unjust.”<br><br>Sir Robert Buckland, the former Tory justice secretary, said the sentences were “fully justified and entirely merited”.<br><br>He said: “I hope it sends a very clear message to self-appointed campaigners that they have to be held accountable for their actions as well, just like everyone else and they are not above the law. There is a silent majority who are fed up with random forms of protest that cause widespread disruption. We’re law-abiding people in this country who want to be protected.”</p></td>

The road has been blocked for several hours dozens of times in recent months by activists with the same demand.</p>

    <p><br><br>A heavy police presence, including officers on horseback, initially prevented the activists from getting on to the road. However, a small group of people managed to sit down on the highway and were detained after ignoring police orders to leave.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion activists have blocked the highway that runs past the temporary home of the Dutch parliament more than 30 times to protest against subsidies. The demonstrators waved flags and chanted: &quot;We are unstoppable, another world is possible.&quot; One held a banner reading: &quot;This is a dead end street.&quot;<br><br>Thunberg was seen flashing a victory sign as she sat in the bus used by police to take detained demonstrators from the scene. At previous protests, police drove detained protesters to another part of the city, where they were released without further consequences.</p></td>

    <p>Environmental activists from Just Stop Oil are calling on the United Nations to back their “human right to protest”.<br><br>The group’s 22-year-old “poster girl”, Phoebe Plummer, faces the first trial under the new UK Section 7 law in May. Rules mean convicted protesters can be jailed for up to a year, fined or both for interfering with “the use or operation of key national infrastructure”.<br><br>But Just Stop Oil claims the legislation is in breach of UN convention and Plummer has urged fellow activists to sign a complaint to Michel Forst, a human rights advisor to the body. She said: “Charged under sec 7 of the public order act? People who have been are putting in a complaint to the UN!<br><br>“Sec 7 is a new law disproportionately restricting our human right to protest, and there is a strong case that this places the UK in breach of UN conventions. This has to be done very quickly as myself and 2 others will be starting the first sec 7 trial in less than 2 months! Adding your name could be a huge help in your defence when you go to trial.”<br><br>Police have been using the new law since last year. It is part of a wider European crackdown on climate protests, in which France and Germany have taken an anti-terror approach to some demos. On October 30, some 65 Just Stop Oil activists were held after slow-marching in Parliament Square against new oil and gas projects.</p>

    <p>Environmental activists from Just Stop Oil are calling on the United Nations to back their “human right to protest”.<br><br>The group’s 22-year-old “poster girl”, Phoebe Plummer, faces the first trial under the new UK Section 7 law in May. Rules mean convicted protesters can be jailed for up to a year, fined or both for interfering with “the use or operation of key national infrastructure”.<br><br>But Just Stop Oil claims the legislation is in breach of UN convention and Plummer has urged fellow activists to sign a complaint to Michel Forst, a human rights advisor to the body. She said: “Charged under sec 7 of the public order act? People who have been are putting in a complaint to the UN!<br><br>“Sec 7 is a new law disproportionately restricting our human right to protest, and there is a strong case that this places the UK in breach of UN conventions. This has to be done very quickly as myself and 2 others will be starting the first sec 7 trial in less than 2 months! Adding your name could be a huge help in your defence when you go to trial.”<br><br>Police have been using the new law since last year. It is part of a wider European crackdown on climate protests, in which France and Germany have taken an anti-terror approach to some demos. On October 30, some 65 Just Stop Oil activists were held after slow-marching in Parliament Square against new oil and gas projects.</p>

    <p>Each defendant claimed they were not granted a fair trial after the judge, Christopher Hehir, ruled that evidence about the climate change could play no part in their defence. Although each was allowed to give their “political and philosophical beliefs” about the climate crisis.<br><br>“The views of any defendant – however sincerely held, and whether or not you agree with them – about manmade climate change, and what should or should not be done about it, are entirely irrelevant to the question of whether or not each is guilty or not guilty,” Hehir told jurors, and he prevented defendants from presenting to the court a 250-page bundle of evidence relating to the climate crisis.<br><br>The defendants were able to get the prosecution to agree to a list of “facts not in dispute” relating to the climate crisis, including that climate change represented an “existential threat to humanity”, that warming about 1.5C “risks catastrophic and irreversible consequences”, that in the previous 12 months the global temperature had averaged 1.63C above preindustrial temperatures, and that in November 2022 the UK government had opened a new round of licensing for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.<br><br>In his closing speech to jurors, made from the dock, Hallam said: “There is good grounds as to quote a phrase from the prosecution because it is blindingly obvious to us here first that you have not been given all the evidence you need, [and] you have not been given the arguments on why you should hear the evidence.<br><br>“You cannot be sure of our guilt if you are not sure that you have not been given the evidence. That’s why I’m behind this screen, because I took my oath before God to tell you the truth, and we have received no good reason why we are not allowed to tell you what is blindingly obvious, namely what I’m not allowed to speak about.<br><br>“If you are not allowed to hear the blindingly obvious then it’s not a fair trial is it?”</p></td>

    <p>John Woodcock, whose review proposes bans for protest groups, has lobbying links to firms in arms and fossil fuel sectors<br><br>Activists have accused the government’s independent adviser on political violence of a conflict of interest, after it emerged that he had lobbying links to companies that would benefit from curbs to protesting.<br><br>John Woodcock, formerly a Labour MP and now a crossbench peer, has prepared a review of “far-left” involvement in disruptive protest, which includes activism against climate change and war. At the same time, he has been chairing and advising lobby groups representing arms manufacturers and fossil fuel firms.<br><br>Woodcock’s review is due to be released next week, more than three years after it was commissioned. Over the weekend he said that, among about 40 recommendations, it would propose bans on at least two protest groups, naming Just Stop Oil, the climate activist campaign, and Palestine Action, which acts against arms companies that supply Israel’s military.<br><br>The organisations could be proscribed, which would restrict their ability to raise funds and their right to assembly in the UK. The Guardian has yet to see a copy of the report.<br><br>Woodcock’s entries in the Lords’ register of interests show he is paid to act as the chair of the Purpose Business Coalition, an organisation run by the PR and lobbying firm Crowne Associates, which counts the oil company BP and the arms company Leonardo among its clients.<br><br>The register also shows he is a paid adviser to Rud Pedersen Public Affairs, another lobbying firm, which acts for Glencore, a Swiss mining company with interests in coal, and Enwell Energy, which describes itself as a “a highly focused oil and gas business”.<br><br>All could theoretically welcome restrictions on protest against their operations. Leonardo, in particular, has been subject to a persistent campaign of protest by Palestine Action, including occupations of its factories during which equipment was smashed, and graffitiing of the entrance to its London HQ.<br><br>Huda Ammori, an activist with Palestine Action who helped uncover the links, said: “Whilst our government remains complicit in the ongoing Gaza genocide, it is our duty to take direct action to halt the production of weapons in Britain which is being used against the Palestinian people.<br><br>“It is a sham for the government to try and claim Lord Walney is an ‘independent’ adviser.”<br><br>Tim Crosland, the director of Plan B, a climate litigation group, said that Walney’s recommendations were “not surprising, since they serve the vested corporate interests he represents”.<br><br>A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: “Last week the government’s climate strategy was declared unlawful for the second time. The same week they licensed 31 new oil projects. Our government has been bought by the fossil fuel lobby and arms dealers. It is increasingly clear that it is they who are the real criminals.”</p>

    <p>Responding to the accusations, Woodcock said: “Over the three years that I have conducted this review I have consistently applied an objective standard and sought a wide range of perspectives, including through a formal call for evidence and analysis of public opinion through polling exercises.<br><br>“I now look forward to the publication of the independent analysis and recommendations in my extensive report. My non-parliamentary interests are declared as required and past positions held are a matter of record.”<br><br>Sign up to Headlines UK<br><br>Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>Woodcock was a Labour MP until 2018, when he resigned from the party during an investigation into claims he had sent inappropriate text messages to a female aide, which he denied.

    <p>John Woodcock, whose review proposes bans for protest groups, has lobbying links to firms in arms and fossil fuel sectors<br><br>Activists have accused the government’s independent adviser on political violence of a conflict of interest, after it emerged that he had lobbying links to companies that would benefit from curbs to protesting.<br><br>John Woodcock, formerly a Labour MP and now a crossbench peer, has prepared a review of “far-left” involvement in disruptive protest, which includes activism against climate change and war. At the same time, he has been chairing and advising lobby groups representing arms manufacturers and fossil fuel firms.<br><br>Woodcock’s review is due to be released next week, more than three years after it was commissioned. Over the weekend he said that, among about 40 recommendations, it would propose bans on at least two protest groups, naming Just Stop Oil, the climate activist campaign, and Palestine Action, which acts against arms companies that supply Israel’s military.<br><br>The organisations could be proscribed, which would restrict their ability to raise funds and their right to assembly in the UK. The Guardian has yet to see a copy of the report.<br><br>Woodcock’s entries in the Lords’ register of interests show he is paid to act as the chair of the Purpose Business Coalition, an organisation run by the PR and lobbying firm Crowne Associates, which counts the oil company BP and the arms company Leonardo among its clients.<br><br>The register also shows he is a paid adviser to Rud Pedersen Public Affairs, another lobbying firm, which acts for Glencore, a Swiss mining company with interests in coal, and Enwell Energy, which describes itself as a “a highly focused oil and gas business”.<br><br>All could theoretically welcome restrictions on protest against their operations. Leonardo, in particular, has been subject to a persistent campaign of protest by Palestine Action, including occupations of its factories during which equipment was smashed, and graffitiing of the entrance to its London HQ.<br><br>Huda Ammori, an activist with Palestine Action who helped uncover the links, said: “Whilst our government remains complicit in the ongoing Gaza genocide, it is our duty to take direct action to halt the production of weapons in Britain which is being used against the Palestinian people.<br><br>“It is a sham for the government to try and claim Lord Walney is an ‘independent’ adviser.”<br><br>Tim Crosland, the director of Plan B, a climate litigation group, said that Walney’s recommendations were “not surprising, since they serve the vested corporate interests he represents”.<br><br>A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: “Last week the government’s climate strategy was declared unlawful for the second time. The same week they licensed 31 new oil projects. Our government has been bought by the fossil fuel lobby and arms dealers. It is increasingly clear that it is they who are the real criminals.”</p>

    <p>Responding to the accusations, Woodcock said: “Over the three years that I have conducted this review I have consistently applied an objective standard and sought a wide range of perspectives, including through a formal call for evidence and analysis of public opinion through polling exercises.<br><br>“I now look forward to the publication of the independent analysis and recommendations in my extensive report. My non-parliamentary interests are declared as required and past positions held are a matter of record.”<br><br>Sign up to Headlines UK<br><br>Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>Woodcock was a Labour MP until 2018, when he resigned from the party during an investigation into claims he had sent inappropriate text messages to a female aide, which he denied. He called for voters to back the Conservatives in 2019 and the following year, Boris Johnson made him a life peer.<br><br>Shortly after, he was appointed the government’s “independent adviser on political violence and disruption” and commissioned to write a review on protest in the wake of the Extinction Rebellion, Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown protests that had roiled the UK before and during the Covid pandemic.<br><br>Although it was nominally an investigation into “an increase in activity and prominence amongst far-right, far-left and other political groups”, he told the Telegraph at the time his focus would be on what he described as “progressive extremism”.<br><br>There was a blind spot on such activities, he said, because they were “carried out in the name of progressive causes to which the political establishment and large majority of the population have great sympathy, like climate change and racial injustice”.<br><br>Woodcock said he submitted his 100,000-word report, entitled Protecting our Democracy from Coercion, to officials in December, after a delay so he could take into account mass protests in London calling for Israel to end its campaign in Gaza.<br><br>In recent months he has trailed several of its recommendations to the press, including bans on face masks on protests, new police powers to end protests near parliament and MPs’ offices, and protest exclusion zones around arms factories and fossil fuel infrastructure.<br><br>But most controversial among its proposals are suggestions that the government enact a form of proscription on groups that regularly break the law as part of their protest strategies.<br><br>“The government should introduce a mechanism to restrict the activity of organisations which have a policy of using criminal offences … to influence government or public debate,” Woodcock’s report says, according to the Daily Mail.</p>

    <p>We are building a popular, nonviolent campaign that will appeal to the sense of anger and betrayal now felt by millions in this country. If politics was working, we would not be living through a mass extinction event, have rising inequality and shitty rivers, and be heading for 2C of heating with no response.<br><br>The system is going to fail. It cannot recognise, respond or mobilise to face the coming crisis – so we have to change the system. It’s simple logic, but together we can protect our communities and families from the coming storm. We will replace today’s failing politics, so action can happen.<br><br>The Rev Mark Coleman, a Just Stop Oil supporter, is standing in the Rochdale byelection: the only candidate to be endorsed by climate scientists. In the coming general election, Just Stop Oil will either stand candidates or support independents who sign up to a radical short manifesto. A manifesto that centres on deliberative democracy for a new People’s House. This will be a standing citizens’ assembly tasked with finding a response to the coming extinction event and the cost of living crisis. It will be the fruit of leafleting, door knocking, public meetings – and a faith in the British public that party politicians have long abandoned.<br><br>The current political system has failed us, so we need to replace it. The carbon parties are not going to save us. They’re only going to take money from us, and give it to big corporations. Labour is flip-flopping over Gaza – and will do the same on protecting this country and its people.<br><br>New oil and gas will destroy our homes, our land, everything we cherish and love. The only justification is to make a tiny number of people very rich. We don’t think that’s a good enough reason. We are the only people telling the truth, the only people calling out those who are harming us, the only people with a plan to change the system.<br><br>Sarah Lunnon is a co-founder of Just Stop Oil</p></td>

    <p>We are building a popular, nonviolent campaign that will appeal to the sense of anger and betrayal now felt by millions in this country. If politics was working, we would not be living through a mass extinction event, have rising inequality and shitty rivers, and be heading for 2C of heating with no response.<br><br>The system is going to fail. It cannot recognise, respond or mobilise to face the coming crisis – so we have to change the system. It’s simple logic, but together we can protect our communities and families from the coming storm. We will replace today’s failing politics, so action can happen.<br><br>The Rev Mark Coleman, a Just Stop Oil supporter, is standing in the Rochdale byelection: the only candidate to be endorsed by climate scientists. In the coming general election, Just Stop Oil will either stand candidates or support independents who sign up to a radical short manifesto. A manifesto that centres on deliberative democracy for a new People’s House. This will be a standing citizens’ assembly tasked with finding a response to the coming extinction event and the cost of living crisis. It will be the fruit of leafleting, door knocking, public meetings – and a faith in the British public that party politicians have long abandoned.<br><br>The current political system has failed us, so we need to replace it. The carbon parties are not going to save us. They’re only going to take money from us, and give it to big corporations. Labour is flip-flopping over Gaza – and will do the same on protecting this country and its people.<br><br>New oil and gas will destroy our homes, our land, everything we cherish and love. The only justification is to make a tiny number of people very rich. We don’t think that’s a good enough reason. We are the only people telling the truth, the only people calling out those who are harming us, the only people with a plan to change the system.<br><br>Sarah Lunnon is a co-founder of Just Stop Oil</p></td>

The protest interfered with the use of these roads in that the use of these roads was severely delayed.”<br><br>In their defence, Plummer, Sarti and Hall said their protest was designed to minimise the amount of disruption caused to drivers, while still causing enough to gain media coverage of their demand that the government introduce a ban on new licences for oil and gas exploitation.</p>

    <p>But on the instructions of Judge Chris Hehir they were restricted in the evidence they could bring regarding their motivation for taking part in the protest and mentions of the climate crisis, and told they could not mount a defence of justification.<br><br>Nonetheless, in closing speeches to the jury, both Plummer, who represented herself, and Raj Chada, who represented Sarti, made reference to the unusual heat in the court, which had led Hehir to finish early on several days of the trial.<br><br>“The irony of that, courtrooms being so hot in May that the trial day ends early, is not lost on me,” Plummer told the jury. She went on: “It was not my intention to delay anyone. I don’t want to cause delay or disruption to anyone.<br><br>“I want to prevent the massive disruption to all of us, from flooded roads, homes, and fields, from heat that melts roads and runways and is already killing and displacing millions around the world. That was my intention.”<br><br>Hehir repeatedly interrupted Plummer’s closing speech, reminding her of his instructions, before finally ordering the jury to leave after she invited them to join her in a minute’s silence for the victims of climate breakdown.<br><br>In his final address to jurors, Hall also made reference to the climate crisis, saying: “Isn’t it more reckless to spend the final two to three years we have [left] to avoid climate breakdown signing petitions and politely protesting by the side of the road, because it’s preferable to our lawbreaking government?”<br><br>At that point he too was silenced by Hehir. The trio will be sentenced on 3 July. The maximum penalty is 12 months imprisonment, an unlimited fine or both.</p></td>

    <p>IT was an audacious plot – and The Sun’s victorious bid to stop it could have come straight from a Hollywood thriller.<br><br>There was a feared mob leader, an undercover operation, a dramatic arrest, then a tense courtroom showdown.<br><br>And on Thursday it came to an end in true blockbuster fashion, with record sentences handed down to the Just Stop Oil eco zealots who we had exposed over their November 2022 protest that brought the M25 to a standstill over four days.<br><br>At Southwark Crown Court in South London Judge Christopher Hehir sentenced the group’s “ideas man” Roger Hallam to five years in jail, while Daniel Shaw, 38, Louise Lancaster, 58, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, and Cressida Gethin, 22, each received four-year jail terms.<br><br>The story had begun almost two years ago when a concerned whistleblower from JSO contacted me, prompted by a genuine fear that lives were at stake.<br><br>Arrangements were made for me to infiltrate a closely guarded JSO meeting at which I listened in amazement and horror as plans were set out to bring the M25 to a halt.<br><br>It all tallied with what my source had told me: “We’re all so worried.<br><br>&quot;The plan is to block the M25 between now and 2023.<br><br>“It’ll be daily and go on for the rest of the year.”<br><br>Most chillingly the whistleblower added: “They’ve become a cult and they are putting lives at risk.”<br><br>Their words were later echoed by the trial judge as he sentenced the JSO ringleaders — or as they call themselves, the “Whole Truth Five”.<br><br>They arranged the one-hour meeting, only to be attended by trusted activists, and hosted by the people who were, I’m told, higher up in the group’s hierarchy.<br><br>It was to set in place plans to rally together as many people as possible so they could cause the “biggest disruption in British history”.<br><br>My source warned me: “They do get a bit suspicious.<br><br>&quot;Use a fake, weird eco name, like FlowerPower. They like naturey names.”<br><br>So that was my codename as I logged on to the call at 7pm on the dot, on November 2, 2022, with my webcam turned off and my microphone muted.<br><br>Strangely for a secret rendezvous, the meeting opened with Bob Marley’s Get Up, Stand Up blaring from the host’s speakers.<br><br>Around a dozen people on the web call nodded along, then a voice boomed out: “We need to squash the evil — and what that involves is closing motorways.<br><br>“It’s almost impossible to stop and causes massive disruption.”<br><br>Then a familiar face popped up on my laptop screen.<br><br>It was Hallam, a 58-year-old organic farmer who is credited with co-founding JSO and acting as its “spiritual leader”.<br><br>He was already known for his front and centre role with earlier eco groups Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain.<br><br>Fresh-faced activists were in thrall, as he had already spent time in jail for his antics.<br><br>In fact we can reveal how he told Document magazine in 2019: “I was in prison last November, and the embarrassing truth is that I had a fantastic time.<br><br>“Going to prison is a deeply emotional and spiritual experience because it exposes you to a different side of life and what it means to sacrifice yourself to a greater cause, and that is a powerful experience.<br><br>“You’re in the cell and you have three naps a day and read your books.<br><br>&quot;For British people, that’s a definition of paradise.<br><br>&quot;I don’t give a toss that the door’s locked or that the food’s not that great.<br><br>&quot;It’s just a rest as far as I’m concerned.”<br><br>The whistleblower’s words rang in my ears as I took in Hallam’s long grey hair and softly-spoken voice and I thought to myself: “He does seem a bit like a cult leader.”<br><br>Sitting in his ground-floor flat in South East London, he vowed: “This is not just another action, it’s potentially the most significant act of civil disobedience in decades.<br><br>“If it goes on for three or four days it is the biggest disruption in British history.”<br><br>This disruption is going to be even more showstopping<br><br>The plan was for protesters to climb the steel gantries over the M25, which would make police stop the traffic out of safety concerns.<br><br>Giggling, Hallam told followers: “We need to get on to the gantries — there’s thousands of them.”</p>

    <p>In his audience was Cambridge University student Cressida “Cressy” Gethin — also jailed this week — who said of an earlier M25 blockade: “To see four lanes of traffic gone was incredible.<br><br>“This disruption is going to be even more showstopping.”<br><br>Fellow defendants Shaw, a social worker, ex-teacher Lancaster and key activist Whittaker De Abreu all spoke on the call.<br><br>As soon as I logged off after the meeting it was clear the evidence I had obtained was damning.<br><br>The next morning I sent my recordings to the Metropolitan Police and National Highways, as the protest was due to start on the following Monday.<br><br>Cops arrested most of the ringleaders in pre-dawn raids and a High Court judge granted an emergency injunction to bar the protests.<br><br>That weekend police arrested Hallam, and the Met’s Territorial Support Group invited me to witness the execution of his warrant.<br><br>This is normal procedure by the police, who regularly invite journalists to attend raids, to ensure transparency in their work.<br><br>I saw cops smash down Hallam’s door and seize his laptops as evidence before he later handed himself in at his local police station.<br><br>In the end, the JSO mob climbed the gantries, but six police forces across the South East of England had created a ring of steel around London’s orbital motorway.<br><br>Specialist teams had been deployed the day before, and there were significantly fewer activists on the gantries than there would otherwise have been.<br><br>However it still caused mayhem, costing the Met more than £1.1million, with damage to the economy put at £765,000.<br><br>It caused people to miss cancer appointments, flights and funerals, and a cop was hurt in an accident.<br><br>Nearly two years later, I had to face Hallam and the four other plotters in court as I gave evidence in front of a jury.<br><br>I faced a grilling from the activists, with four of them representing themselves, and a barrister.<br><br>I was quizzed about my methods as a journalist in the packed courtroom.<br><br>When Hallam came to question me, he looked me in the eye and asked a series of questions that the judge ruled inappropriate.<br><br>“What were my views on climate change?” he demanded to know.<br><br>The defence barrister then asked: “Why had I not handed the videos to the police sooner?<br><br>“Did I care more about the story than the people?”<br><br>No, I told the jury.<br><br>I am a journalist, so of course I care about stories, but I care immensely about public safety, and I handed over the videos as quickly as I could.<br><br>The judge was quick to remind the courtroom I was not on trial.When my appearance was over, I sighed with relief.<br><br>The entire two-week trial was crammed with drama.<br><br>Hallam, Shaw, Lancaster and Gethin all had their bail revoked during the trial after they defied an order by the judge not to talk about climate change when addressing the jury.<br><br>Others were arrested for contempt for allegedly attempting to influence jurors trying the case, but proceedings have since been discontinued.<br><br>Judge Hehir said Hallam had been encouraging people on X to come to court with placards saying: “Juries deserve to hear the whole truth” and “Juries have the absolute right to acquit a defendant on their conscience”.<br><br>When passing sentence, the judge told the defendants: “The plain fact is that at some point you have crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic.<br><br>“Your fanaticism has made you heedless of the rights of your fellow citizens.”<br><br>The judge said Hallam was “at the very top of the tree as far as the conspiracy is concerned” and that the Zoom call was “compelling evidence”.<br><br>He added: “Had not Ms Howes and The Sun passed the recordings to the police I consider it likely that the disruption would have been greater than it was.”<br><br>When I heard the verdict I was elated — despite the concerns that I and most other people share about the future of the planet.<br><br>This was a simple case of breaking the law — and it was proven by the Crown.<br><br>And in turn, this vindicated The Sun’s reporting.</p>

        <h1>Retired priest speaks of ‘painful’ treatment by church over her climate protests</h1><p>The Rev Sue Parfitt has lost right to conduct religious ceremonies after her arrest at a Just Stop Oil demonstration<br><br>An 82-year-old retired priest has spoken of her pain at losing her right to conduct religious ceremonies because of her participation in Just Stop Oil protests.<br><br>The Rev Sue Parfitt was arrested in May after allegedly causing damage to the glass around Magna Carta at the British Library in London as part of a protest with the climate action group. She is still awaiting trial.<br><br>It is one of dozens of protests the retired priest has taken part in during the last few years for Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain.<br><br>After her arrest in May, she was told by the diocese of Bristol and the city’s bishop, Vivienne Faull, that she would be denied permission to officiate (PTO) because of the charges she is facing.<br><br>PTO is a licence granted by the Church of England, typically to retired priests or deacons, that allows them to conduct religious ceremonies. It has to be renewed every three years and renewal is usually only refused for severe wrongdoing.<br><br>Parfitt, who lives in Bristol, said she has been negotiating with the diocese for her PTO renewal since the start of 2023. She was subject to a safeguarding check that recommended she should be granted the permission.<br><br>“It’s painful – I would be foolish to deny it,” she said. “And the irony is it’s the 30th anniversary year of women being ordained as priests.”<br><br>Parfitt and Faull were among the first women to join the priesthood.<br><br>“I am very shocked, surprised and disappointed in [Faull’s] attitude. I, and everybody else, find it inexplicable, considering her strong lead on the climate.”<br><br>Faull has been a progressive voice on climate action in the church in recent years, with the diocese of Bristol declaring a climate emergency in 2019 and being the first diocese in the UK to commit to reach zero carbon emissions by 2030.<br><br>At the time, Faull said that “care for God’s creation is key to our Christian faith” and that the move would “send a strong message” that “we must all act now” to combat the climate crisis.</p>

    <p>Parfitt said that she believed the climate crisis was a “spiritual issue”, adding: “This is God’s creation, and we need to be doing all we can to save it. I don’t want to sound too pious, but it’s part of the sacrifice I’ve been called to make.”<br><br>She added: “I’m the first priest this has happened to, even as some other clergy have been in prison [for similar protests]. And of course, it stands as a threat to everyone else. It is a double punishment.”<br><br>Parfitt said “the biggest thing” was that she would never be able to preside over a eucharist again. “That is a big deal. But if it came to the point where [Faull] said to me: ‘You can have your licence back if you commit to never take any illegal action again,’ I wouldn’t agree to that.”<br><br>Sign up to Observed<br><br>Analysis and opinion on the week&#x27;s news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>Several Just Stop Oil campaigners have faced professional repercussions as a result of their protests. The Guardian reported in March that three GPs involved in climate activism were awaiting professional tribunals where they faced being potentially struck off.<br><br>In July, five Just Stop Oil activists were sentenced to four and five years in prison for planning a protest that would cause gridlock on the M25. The sentences are thought to be the longest ever given in the UK for nonviolent protest.<br><br>A spokesperson for the Bristol diocese confirmed that Parfitt’s PTO had originally run out on 31 December 2022, but that she “remains a clerk in holy orders”.<br><br>They said: “PTO is not being issued at this time based on the fact that Ms Parfitt is facing criminal charges in ongoing court proceedings.<br><br>“The diocese recognises everyone’s legal right to protest. We support the call for more urgent action to combat the environmental crisis the world is facing and advocate for the changes in peaceful and lawful ways.”</p></td>

        <h1>Retired priest speaks of ‘painful’ treatment by church over her climate protests</h1><p>An 82-year-old retired priest has spoken of her pain at losing her right to conduct religious ceremonies because of her participation in Just Stop Oil protests.<br><br>The Rev Sue Parfitt was arrested in May after allegedly causing damage to the glass around Magna Carta at the British Library in London as part of a protest with the climate action group. She is still awaiting trial.<br><br>After her arrest in May, she was told by the diocese of Bristol and the city&#x27;s bishop, Vivienne Faull, that she would be denied permission to officiate (PTO) because of the charges she is facing.<br><br>PTO is a licence granted by the Church of England, typically to retired priests or deacons, that allows them to conduct religious ceremonies. It has to be renewed every three years and renewal is usually only refused for severe wrongdoing.<br><br>Parfitt, who lives in Bristol, said she has been negotiating with the diocese for her PTO renewal since the start of 2023. She was subject to a safeguarding check that recommended she should be granted the permission.</p>

    <p><br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s painful – I would be foolish to deny it,&quot; she said. &quot;And the irony is it&#x27;s the 30th anniversary year of women being ordained as priests.&quot;<br><br>Parfitt said that she believed the climate crisis was a &quot;spiritual issue&quot;, adding: &quot;This is God&#x27;s creation, and we need to be doing all we can to save it. I don&#x27;t want to sound too pious, but it&#x27;s part of the sacrifice I&#x27;ve been called to make.&quot;<br><br>Parfitt said &quot;the biggest thing&quot; was that she would never be able to preside over a eucharist again. &quot;That is a big deal. But if it came to the point where [Faull] said to me: &#x27;You can have your licence back if you commit to never take any illegal action again,&#x27; I wouldn&#x27;t agree to that.&quot;<br><br>A spokesperson for the Bristol diocese said: &quot;PTO is not being issued at this time based on the fact that Ms Parfitt is facing criminal charges in ongoing court proceedings.&quot;</p></td>

        <h1>Police acting as ‘private security’ for Drax power station, say climate activists</h1><p>Greenpeace among 150 groups expressing outrage after preemptive arrests led to cancellation of protest camp<br><br>Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have accused police of acting as “private security” for the UK’s biggest carbon emitter after dozens of pre-emptive arrests forced the cancellation of a climate protest camp near Drax power station.<br><br>In a statement signed by almost 150 groups, they called the operation against activists who had spent months planning the camp near the wood-burning power station “an unreasonable restriction of free speech”.<br><br>It comes as the Labour government faces difficult choices over the future of Drax, which, despite contributing about 3% of the UK’s carbon emissions, is classed as “renewable” and benefits from about £2m a day in green energy subsidies.<br><br>Activists from Reclaim the Power had planned to camp near Drax, near Selby in North Yorkshire, from 8 August for five days, in a protest highlighting its environmental impact. But on the eve of the camp, police swooped, arresting 25 people and seizing tents, fire safety equipment and wheelchair accessible flooring, without which activists said they could not go ahead.<br><br>North Yorkshire police said they acted “swiftly and robustly to reduce the risk of unlawful activity”. But environmental groups said they are outraged at the action, which came as the country was elsewhere gripped by violent anti-immigration riots.<br><br>“Now we know what the police have been doing with their resources: preventing citizens from criticising a profit-making company which receives huge amounts of public money,” the groups said.<br><br>“The public has the right to express their views over how their money is spent. Gathering at a camp to express these views is not a crime. Police taking equipment to prevent this camp going ahead is an unreasonable restriction of free speech and is highly oppressive.<br><br>“The UK has seen 15 years of falling living standards, a cost of living crisis and decades of blaming migrants for the UK’s problems. But the real cause of our economic problems is the corrupt relationship between the state and corporations like Drax, who receive state support while profiting from sky-high energy bills, and who seem to be using the police as their own private security.”<br><br>A spokesperson for North Yorkshire police said: “It was our responsibility to manage the protest planned for the Climate Action camp in line with legal obligations. We also had a duty to ensure that people who work at Drax and members of the local community could go about their daily business as usual.”<br><br>While the protest’s impact was blunted by the police operation, Ed Miliband, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, still faces a dilemma over Drax. Under current accounting rules, the site provides a substantial portion of the UK’s “renewable” power, a hefty chunk for which there are no obvious current replacements.</p>

    <p>Without it, Labour’s manifesto commitment to fully decarbonise the power sector by 2030 will be hard to meet, given the slow pace of renewable energy deployment in recent years.<br><br>Built as a coal-fired power station but since converted to use wood in its boilers, Drax emitted about 11.5m tonnes of CO2 last year. Nevertheless, wood – or biomass – counts as renewable fuel, making the company eligible for renewable energy subsidies, on the basis that new forests can be grown to replace the biomass burned.<br><br>But regrowing forests takes decades, while the carbon from burning trees enters the atmosphere – and heats the planet – now. In the midst of a climate emergency, there is increasing concern from scientists and activists that biomass burning is a dangerous diversion from the task of decarbonising power.<br><br>Current subsidy arrangements expire in 2027 and it is not clear what will replace them. Drax wants public money to fit its biomass boilers with new technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide they produce. But that will take further tens of billions and, although it could cut carbon emissions, it will not solve the problem of the origins of its biomass.<br><br>Many experts believe subsidising Drax is poor value for money. Frankie Mayo, an analyst at the Ember thinktank and author of a recent report that found Drax got £550m in subsidies last year, said: “Burning wood pellets can be as bad for the environment as coal. Supporting biomass with subsidies is a costly mistake.”<br><br>Drax said it had paid £238m in total taxes so far in 2024 – half of its total pre-tax profits. It said the Ember report was “flawed” and ignored the “widely accepted and internationally recognised approach to carbon accounting”.<br><br>“Drax power station generates around 8% of the UK’s renewable electricity, keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses. We are paid for the power we produce like every other renewable generator,” a spokesperson for the company said.<br><br>“We plan to invest billions in developing two bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) units at Drax power station which could create up to 10,000 new jobs at the peak of construction. The technology that underpins BECCS is proven, and it is the only credible large-scale way of generating secure renewable power and delivering carbon removals.”<br><br>A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “Investing in clean power is the route to ending the UK’s energy insecurity and tackling the climate crisis.<br><br>“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines biomass sourced in line with strict sustainability criteria as a low carbon source of energy. We will continue to monitor biomass electricity generation to ensure it meets required standards.<br><br>“The subsidies for large-scale biomass generators will end in 2027 and we are reviewing evidence on potential support beyond this.”</p></td>

    <p>A memory card smuggled out of a Russian jail in a match box and a letter from Beatles icon Sir Paul McCartney to Vladimir Putin helped end an international scandal.<br><br>That might sound like a plot in a Hollywood movie, but it is actually the reason why British Greenpeace activists are not rotting in a Siberian prison.<br><br>In 2013 a group of 30 environmentalists from around the world, including five Brits, set their sights on a Russian oil company, Gazprom, that was about to start drilling in the Barents Sea.<br><br>Their plan was relatively simple, attach a pod to the side of the oil rig which they could protest from, not only would they halt production, they’d draw the world’s attention to the impact of fossil fuels and stop what they believed was an international oil rush in the Arctic.<br><br>But instead they were shot at by the Russian coastguard and caught up in a scandal after their ship was raided by gun-toting counter-terrorism soldiers and the entire crew arrested on piracy charges, jailed for two months with the threat of a further 15 years behind bars.<br><br>Now the dramatic inside story on how their environmental mission turned into a nightmare is being told for the first time in a new six part BBC Two series, On Thin Ice: Putin v Greenpeace, which starts on Sunday.<br><br>Using incredible unseen footage captured by the protestors and testimony from many involved, the series lifts the lid on what was really going on behind the headlines.<br><br>Ben Stewart, who was head of communications for Greenpeace at the time, was drunk and raving in a London nightclub when he received a panicked phone call from aboard their ship, the Arctic Sunrise.<br><br>The crew had been shot at trying to carry out their mission and were now under attack.<br><br>A helicopter carrying heavily armed and balaclava-clad Russian solders was attempting to land on their ship and they knew they were in serious danger.<br><br>While the crew had locked down as much of the ship as possible to hold off the attack, it was only a matter of time before they lost control and were cut off from the outside world.<br><br>Action co-ordinator Frank Hewetson, 58, who has been with Greenpeace for 30 years, managed to make a call before it was too late.<br><br>Ben said: “My phone started ringing and I looked at it, it had this 15-digit number that I didn&#x27;t recognise, it was like a barcode or something.<br><br>“I just heard Frank trying to convey information as quickly as he could. And he said, ‘there’s about 20 of them, they&#x27;re special forces, they were heavily armed’, you knew s**t was going down.<br><br>“He sounded deeply adrenalised, I was deeply drunk and sobered up very, very quickly.<br><br>“This was a gross overreaction by the Russians, but also what they&#x27;ve done is not legal.”<br><br>Ben felt guilty, just weeks previously he’d been set to go on the mission but had to pull out at the last minute.<br><br>He was replaced by 27-year-old Brit Alexandra Harris from Exeter, and it was her first protest for Greenpeace.<br><br>Not wanting to scare her parents, she’d told them she was going to the Artic to research polar bears.<br><br>Instead, she found herself at the centre of the drama.<br><br>Alexandra said: “It&#x27;s like finding yourself in the middle of a James Bond movie. I was terrified.<br><br>“I’ve never had a gun pointed at me before.<br><br>“We were all taken down to the bottom of the ship, put in the mess, they searched us to make sure that we didn&#x27;t have anything on us like mobile phones, footage, that kind of thing.&quot;<br><br>Little did they realise that former cameraman Phil Ball had recorded everything and managed to hide the camera in his pants before carefully stuffing the memory card in the sole of his boot.<br><br>Miraculously, even after being banged up behind bars, the Russians never discovered it.<br><br>And Phil managed to get the memory card smuggled out of prison hidden in a matchbox he gave to his interpreter.<br><br>For Brit Frank Hewetson, storming an oil rig in the middle of the sea was nothing new.</p>

    <p>The 58-year-old is banned from entering America and Greenland after staging multiple protests for Greenpeace against oil companies around the globe.<br><br>But this experience pushed him to the brink of a nervous breakdown as he struggled to cope behind bars, locked in the same cell with a double killer and the head of a Russian taser gang.<br><br>He said: “It was an incredibly daring mission. It needed to be done. But the plan, I think you could say, went to s**t!<br><br>“I felt a mixture of anxiety and guilt. I felt responsible for the entire action. I felt deep in my heart the enormity of all 30 of us being incarcerated.<br><br>“I had a very close shave with having a total nervous breakdown.<br><br>“We were only allowed out once a day to walk in this outdoor cell and you would shout out ‘sunrise’.<br><br>“And if you heard someone else shouting out sunrise, you could quickly, in those few minutes, try to discuss what was happening to you, then you were dragged off.<br><br>“I turned up one day for exercise and I heard someone whistling The Greatest Escape, I started whistling back and it was so cheesy but in a sense I can’t tell you how deeply emotional that was.<br><br>“I was dreaming of my own great escape moment but the reality was I was staring down 15 years in prison and it was brutal.”<br><br>Back in London, in the basement of the Greenpeace UK headquarters, which had become known as the “room of doom”, Ben realised he had to come up with another way of convincing Putin to let their team go home.<br><br>The group, known as the Arctic 30, were caught in a game of political football.<br><br>At the time Putin was facing growing civil rebellion and he couldn’t look weak.<br><br>And overseas, the race to conquer the Arctic oil fields was hotting up, Putin knew he couldn’t risk a rival getting there first so was going to use the Arctic 30 as an example not to test Russian dominance in the region.<br><br>So in a bizarre turn of events, Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney proved to be a deciding factor in saving the day.<br><br>Ben explained: “We were up against this huge monolith, the might of the Russian political and judicial system.

    <p>THE new documentary investigates the British Greenpeace activists who planned to protest from the side of an oil rig in the Arctic.<br><br>In 2013 a group of 30 environmentalists from around the world, including five Brits, set their sights on a Russian oil company, Gazprom, that was about to start drilling in the Barents Sea.<br><br>Their plan was relatively simple, attach a pod to the side of the oil rig which they could protest from, not only would they halt production, they&#x27;d draw the world&#x27;s attention to the impact of fossil fuels and stop what they believed was an international oil rush in the Arctic.<br><br>But instead they were shot at by the Russian coastguard and caught up in a scandal after their ship was raided by gun-toting counter-terrorism soldiers and the entire crew arrested on piracy charges, jailed for two months with the threat of a further 15 years behind bars.<br><br>Action co-ordinator Frank Hewetson, 58, who has been with Greenpeace for 30 years, managed to make a call before it was too late. A helicopter carrying heavily armed and balaclava-clad Russian solders was attempting to land on their ship and they knew they were in serious danger.</p>

    <p>Thirty years ago, more than 500 activists united to save a street – and their actions marked a major turning-point in the environmental movement<br><br>Walking through Leyton, in east London, you could easily miss Claremont Road. It is hardly a road at all, but a stubby little sidestreet between terrace houses that ends abruptly in a brick wall. But when it comes to the history of direct action, this could be one of the most significant sites in England. Thirty years ago, in November 1994, the scene here was very different: 700 police officers and bailiffs in riot gear marched into a significantly larger Claremont Road and waged battle against about 500 activists, who were dug in – some of them literally – against efforts to evict them.<br><br>The activists occupied rooftop towers, treehouses, underground bunkers and even secret tunnels. It took three days to get them all out. In retrospect, the “Battle of Claremont Road”, as it came to be known, was an almost unbelievable event. “I talk about the three C’s that underpin this type of activism: creativity, courage and cheek,” says campaigner Camilla Berens, who was there. “It set the template for the next 20 or 30 years of how to do responsible disruption.”<br><br>The reason for the battle, and the reason Claremont Road is now so short, lies behind that brick wall at its end: what is now the six-lane A12, also known as the M11 link road. The road had been planned since the 1960s, to connect east London to the north-east, but nothing happened for decades. In the interim, many of the condemned homes were vacated by residents and reoccupied by squatters and artists. (As a student, I squatted on Claremont Road for three years. I left in summer 1993.)<br><br>By the 1990s, the Conservative government was determined to make good on Margaret Thatcher’s promise to carry out “the biggest road-building programme since the Romans”. Resistance from locals and environmental groups was growing, though, against schemes such as the M3 extension at Twyford Down in Hampshire (which went ahead), and the proposed east London river crossing through Oxleas Wood, in south-east London (which did not).<br><br>“The M11 link road was effectively the Cinderella of the three,” says veteran cycling campaigner Roger Geffen. Unlike Twyford Down and Oxleas Wood, the M11 scheme went through a poor urban neighbourhood, rather than an area of natural beauty, “but in a way, that’s what made it interesting,” he says. It was destroying the environment by uprooting trees and prioritising cars, but it was also destroying a community. This was the era of the Criminal Justice Act, targeting illegal raves, squatters and Travellers, which also passed in November 1994. The poll tax riots of 1990 had been another landmark. The Claremont Road protests were a “a joined-up mix of social and environmental motivations”.<br><br>At the time, Geffen had just moved to London. “I didn’t have a green brain cell in my head,” he says, but he had just taken up cycling. Weaving through the traffic-clogged streets, he says, he realised: “What I was doing wasn’t crazy. I was overtaking a lot of people in little boxes, and that was far crazier than what I was doing.” He joined the London Cycling Campaign, which led him into anti-car activism.<br><br>By the early 90s, the Department for Transport had begun repossessing and demolishing houses along the route of the M11 link road. In 1994, Claremont Road was the last street standing. “We realised that we needed to make a big focus of it,” says Geffen.<br><br>“One of the first things we did was to barricade it and set up street furniture,” says John Drury, then a PhD student studying collective action. The street became something of a countercultural tourist attraction, with colourful murals and outdoor sculptures made of junk and a public cafe. Doug (not his real name), then an unemployed activist, says: “There was a real buzz, and it had a lot of energy, and everyone was really friendly, so I just started sticking around.”<br><br>As the inevitable showdown approached, preparations became more rushed. “We had to just throw everything at it,” says Geffen. Some protesters built wooden observation towers on top of their houses. “So we thought, OK, what happens if we build an absolutely huge tower?” This became “Dolly”, a scaffolding structure 30 metres (100ft) high, rising out of the rooftops. It was named after Dolly Watson, a 92-year-old former actor who had lived on Claremont Road her entire life, and was among the last of the residents to leave. She once told a reporter: “They’re not dirty hippy squatters, they’re the grandchildren I never had.”<br><br>Other ad-hoc battlements appeared: treehouses, connected to the houses across the street by webs of netting and walkways; roadblocks made out of cars and shopping trolleys filled with concrete. Some activists built underground bunkers in which to seal themselves – “very elaborate womb-like structures that involved lots of layers of mattresses, foam, metal and furniture,” Doug recalls. The idea was that whatever tool the police or bailiffs tried to use to get them out “would get gummed up”. The upper floors of several houses beneath the tower were knocked together to create a “rat run”, and the stairs up to them were removed, to make it harder for the police to reach the protesters.<br><br>Volunteers had been monitoring police compounds for signs of activity. The callout came on 27 November. “‘It’s the one, it’s the big eviction. Claremont is going to be taken,’” recalls Berens, a journalist who reported on the events for the Guardian. “I think the whole of alternative London turned up. There was a massive party the night before.”<br><br>The next morning, 28 November, an estimated 500 protesters were ready, remembers Neil Goodwin, who edited his colleague’s Mayyasa Al-Malazi’s footage of the siege: “The rooftops were packed; every bunker, every treehouse, on the nets, the landings, the walkways, up the tower – everyone was in situ.”<br><br>“The police turned up in the early afternoon,” recalls Mark Green (not his real name), another participant. “There were hundreds of them and they swarmed into the street in stormtrooper gear with batons raised. They were expecting a full-on riot. Instead they just found a bunch of hippies and local residents sitting around.” A sound system on the tower cranked up the Prodigy album Music for the Jilted Generation.<br><br>Things didn’t go as planned for the police. “They thought they were going to start by tackling the houses, and then they realised people had locked on to the road itself,” says Julia Guest, then an aspiring photographer. Activists had drilled holes into the asphalt, into which they had sunk lock-on bolts, which were covered over with sheets of metal with holes in them. The activists “lay down with their arms through the holes and locked their wrists on with handcuffs.”<br><br>The police and bailiffs brought in mechanical diggers, cherrypickers, ladders, hammers and crowbars; and every occupant made themselves as difficult as possible to remove. “I was in the loft at number 42, which I’d covered in corrugated iron and filled with tyres,” says Goodwin. “They had to prise us open, like a sardine tin.”</p>

    <p>When the bailiffs eventually broke through that evening, Goodwin attached himself to part of the scaffolding tower with a bicycle D-lock, the keys of which he had chucked into a pile of tyres. “The bailiff pokes his head in, shines his torch around and goes: ‘OK, we’ll do this tomorrow.’ So they left, and I’m like: ‘I’m gonna be sitting here all night.’ So I said to people: ‘Could you see if you can find some D-lock keys?’” Luckily, they were just teetering over the edge of a gap in the floorboards.<br><br>Everyone remembers being cold and hungry, especially the first night. Few people had warm clothes, let alone sleeping bags. “After it got dark, someone led me down through a loft to warm up a bit,” says Green. “We then went through a hole in a wall and exited through a wardrobe, which was surreal, into a room where people were watching themselves on the news on an old black-and-white portable TV.”<br><br>By the second day, about half the protesters had been evicted. But, says Geffen: “The police were puzzled that people who they thought they’d evicted kept reappearing. Eventually, they got a metal detector out.” They discovered the activists had built a tunnel out of oil drums, running underneath the back gardens and into one of the houses on the next road. Supplies and people had been going back and forth the whole time. “When they found the tunnel, everyone on the tower and all the roofs just laughed at them.”<br><br>The longer the protest went on, “the more brutal the police and bailiffs became”, says Berens. Green says he saw people shoved, grabbed and falling from heights (though no one was seriously injured). “It definitely felt like there was a political element to it.”<br><br>The protesters “had a very strong commitment to non-violence”, says Geffen. “We needed to be acting in accordance with the values that we wanted to speak for. If we’re talking about environmental sustainability and sharing this Earth, and working in community, then violence doesn’t form part of that.”<br><br>By the end of the second day, there was only one protester left: Doug. “I kept moving,” he says. “If you live on a scaffolding tower for a few days, you can get quite good at swinging around. And they didn’t really want to chase me around in a game of cat and mouse.” Doug’s persistence extended the protest by another full day. The police even brought in a “hostage negotiator” to try to coax him down. “He pretended he was my dad, and was just concerned for my welfare.” Doug was not swayed. “I grabbed some rope, a saw and a few planks of wood, and I used them to make myself what was basically a coffin, which I slept in.” The police finally got to him the next morning.<br><br>In the end, the police spent more than £1m evicting the protesters. The M11 link road still got built, of course. Nobody believed the campaign would stop it. “But what it did do,” says Drury, “was it turned the roads programme into a political thing. So, we won the moral argument, even if we didn’t win that battle.”<br><br>When Labour came into power in 1997, it cut the major road schemes inherited from the Tories from 150 to 37, and pledged to focus on public transport. It felt like a victory for the anti-car campaigners, but it did not last. By 2000, New Labour was committing at least £30bn to building and improving roads, and forecasting that another 2,500 miles of road would need to be built.<br><br>Several of the Claremont Road activists went straight on to form Reclaim the Streets in 1995, which performed guerrilla anti-car actions – such as blocking off public roads to hold impromptu “street parties” – across the UK and worldwide. It also paved the way for subsequent campaigns such as Plane Stupid, the Climate Action Camps, Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil.<br><br>The protest changed the lives of many of those who took part. “That was the day that I crossed the line,” says Berens. “Before that, I was a journalist looking in and reporting on it, but because it was such an impressive campaign, and the people were so amazing, I became a committed activist.”<br><br>“It impacted me quite profoundly,” says Guest. She became a documentary film-maker focusing on human rights in Israel, Palestine and Iraq.<br><br>Paul Morozzo, one of the key organisers alongside Geffen, is now a campaigner at Greenpeace. Drury is a professor of social psychology at Sussex university. Doug is a lawyer dealing with civic issues.<br><br>Green went on to design the famous Extinction Symbol, as used by Extinction Rebellion. He is less nostalgic about the event: “I found the overall experience cold, dirty and depressing,” he says. He doesn’t like to describe it as a “battle”. “That suggests an exchange of violence, whereas it was just a group of people passively occupying an area, with the only violence coming from the police.”<br><br>But like a battle, the event took its toll. As well as committed activists, the area and the protest attracted many people with drug and mental health problems, not to mention locals who were either uprooted or forced to live on the edge of a six-lane road. “I naively hoped it would be a spark for a wider and longer-lasting societal change,” says Green. “Instead, things have just got much worse since then than we could ever have imagined.”<br><br>Geffen received an MBE for services to cycling in 2015, and now heads Low Traffic Future. “What I’m now doing is still basically the same cause,” he says. “In the 1990s, transport, roads, cars were the central issue for the environmental movement, then we lost a lot of that momentum. Environmental campaigners have gone on to do some great things on energy … but transport is now the biggest-emitting sector of the UK economy, as well as being problematic in terms of air pollution, road safety, children’s ability to play in the streets and all the waste products of car culture.” He thinks the movement needs to focus again on transport.<br><br>Another action like Claremont Road is unthinkable now, given how far legislation has tightened against protest, public disorder and squatting.<br><br>“It breaks my heart,” says Guest, “because actions like that created a generation of people that have become acutely aware, and prepared to act on strong beliefs. That is, after all, the only way that anything that’s unjust gets changed. And if people are prevented from being able to freely connect with that sort of experience, then what sort of world is going to come next?”<br><br>This article was amended on 26 November 2024. Paul Morozzo is a campaigner at Greenpeace and not campaign director, as an earlier version said. Also, it was not Neil Goodwin who recorded footage of the siege, but Mayyasa Al-Malazi.</p>

When police arrived in &quot;stormtrooper gear with batons raised&quot;, they found activists had drilled holes into the asphalt with lock-on bolts, lying down with their arms through holes and locking their wrists with handcuffs.<br><br>The protesters &quot;had a very strong commitment to non-violence&quot;, maintaining they needed to act &quot;in accordance with the values that we wanted to speak for&quot;. Police spent more than £1m on the eviction, using mechanical diggers, cherrypickers, and metal detectors to find the secret tunnel.<br><br>Though the road was built, the protest &quot;turned the roads programme into a political thing&quot; and paved the way for subsequent campaigns such as Reclaim the Streets, Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil.</p>

Video footage posted on social media showed two people wearing white shirts with the slogan Just Stop Oil, approaching the stone circle with canisters and spraying orange powder paint.<br><br>Wiltshire Police said officers had attended the scene and arrested two people. A spokesman for the force said: “At around noon, we responded to a report that orange paint had been sprayed on some of the stones by two suspects.<br><br>“Officers attended the scene and arrested two people on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument. Our inquiries are ongoing, and we are working closely with English Heritage.” English Heritage said experts were assessing the “extent of the damage” on the stones.

        <h1>I used to conserve artworks. Now I am in prison for taking climate action</h1><p>It was my dream job.

Aged 16, I fell head over heels for painting and could imagine nothing better than spending my life working in museums.<br><br>Looking back almost 40 years, I see my younger self, starstruck in Paris. I’m staring up with awe at Théodore Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa and greedily gobbling up the story of how it scandalised the art world. That sickening green cadaver that almost fell out of the frame had me weeping with admiration. Of course it shocked the critics. They hated the grisly truth: the emaciated corpse that was a direct challenge to government corruption and incompetence.<br><br>This was a history painting that focused on something scandalous, current and controversial. It exposed the government nepotism and corruption that placed an incompetent captain in charge of a navy frigate that was subsequently shipwrecked. There were insufficient lifeboats, and he and his fellow officers saved themselves, abandoning the lower-class crew to death by murder, cannibalism, starvation.<br><br>Géricault thrust this gruesome horror right in front of polite society’s eyes. He starkly showcased the extreme individual suffering that results from political corruption and self-centred individualism. I was bowled over by the realisation that art could be a mechanism to expose horror and greed, that it could stir up the social soup, shock, shake, prod, horrify, question and provoke change. You won’t be remotely surprised to learn that the painting was only fully appreciated after Géricault’s death.<br><br>But, as my younger self worked towards building a future among masterpieces such as this, I was not even aware of another brutal and insidious tale of corruption that was unfolding unseen. Fossil-fuel companies were covering up the consequences of the deadly activities that brought them unspeakable profit at the expense of everyone else. They knew unbridled consumption of fossil fuels would cause mass death and devastation to the natural world, but forged ahead regardless while most of us carried on in ignorant bliss.<br><br>Working in museums and historic houses for more than 25 years, as a curator, a collections manager, a registrar and a conservation cleaner, it was my job to care for irreplaceable precious things. Sometimes I was accompanying a glamorous be-ruffed Van Dyck to an exhibition. Maybe I was carefully packing a dirty, broken shoe telling the tale of a nameless working woman. I cleaned out gutters and drains to prevent leaks, trained staff to evacuate or protect historical objects in the event of fire or flood, scrutinised temperature and relative humidity readings, adjusted blinds to stop the slightest hint of destructive sunlight, consulted security experts on the latest anti-crime gadgets. My colleagues and I aimed always to manage the natural process of deterioration and do all in our power to slow it down so these objects could be preserved for future generations.</p>

        <h1>Geldof and Colman urge Home Office to reconsider climate activist’s deportation</h1><p>Exclusive: Actors and musicians condemn ‘harsh deportation’ of  Dartford Crossing protester Marcus Decker<br><br>Leading actors and musicians including Bob Geldof, Olivia Colman and Emma Thompson are calling on the Home Office to reconsider the “harsh deportation” of a climate activist who is serving one of the longest prison sentences in modern British history for peaceful protest.<br><br>Along with the musicians Brian Eno and Jacob Collier, they are among about 600 artists who are urging James Cleverly to withdraw the deportation order issued to Marcus Decker.<br><br>Decker is serving a jail sentence of two years and seven months for a protest in which he climbed the Queen Elizabeth Bridge over the Dartford Crossing and unveiled a Just Stop Oil banner in October 2022.<br><br>Decker, who is German, was served a deportation order by the Home Office while in prison.<br><br>The actors spoke out as the British government was criticised this week by the UN special rapporteur on environmental defenders. Michel Forst said the severe crackdown on environmental protest was having a chilling effect on fundamental freedoms.<br><br>In their letter, the actors say: “We believe that punishing him [Decker] with deportation in addition to the 14 months he has already spent in prison is out of proportion to the crime committed and unconducive to the public good.”<br><br>They say the protest Decker created was peaceful, adding “no one was harmed” and that it lasted less than two days.<br><br>“Consider that just in January of this year police closed both the Dartford Crossing and the Dartford Tunnel due to dangerous weather conditions, causing substantial disruption. Such extreme weather will only become increasingly frequent with escalating climate change.<br><br>“It was to prevent horrific disruption and suffering that Marcus took part in this action.”<br><br>Their words echoed those of Forst, who said this week that climate activists were acting for the “benefit of us all” and must be protected.<br><br>More than 150,000 people have signed a petition against Decker’s deportation.</p>

    <p>The letter says: “We urge you to consider what it would look like to the rest of the world if the UK, which prides itself in leading on climate action, were to start deporting human rights defenders like Marcus.”<br><br>Decker’s partner, Holly Cullen-Davies, a musician, said he planned to fight his deportation through the courts once he had been released from prison. His release is expected soon.<br><br>Decker’s fellow protester Morgan Trowland, who was given a three-year jail term, was released in December.<br><br>“Deporting Marcus is the ultimate punishment not just for Marcus but for us his family. It comes on top of one of the longest jail sentences for a climate protester and is a double punishment,” said Cullen-Davies. “Marcus is staying really calm as he waits for his release; it is torture for all of us. He find the prospect of deportation impossible to bear or imagine. I don’t know what we will do if that happens.<br><br>“What I would say to the government, though, is you cannot deport dissent and you cannot deport the climate crisis.”<br><br>Cullen-Davies said she had had to give up most of her work to campaign against the deportation of her partner and was relying on donations from environmental campaigners to keep herself afloat financially.<br><br>Decker is unlikely to be deported immediately on his release as he has filed a legal challenge to the order.<br><br>The letter follows a similar appeal to the home secretary from hundreds of scientists including James Dyke, associate professor in Earth system science and the assistant director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, and Julia K Steinberger, professor of ecological economics at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.<br><br>Forst, the UN rapporteur under the Aarhus convention, is gathering evidence of what he said was the worrying clampdown on climate protesters and considering what further action to take. The UK government is a signatory to the legally binding treaty and could be found to be acting illegally once his investigations are completed.</p></td>

    </figure>
    <p>Labour is urgently reviewing security arrangements after a protester was able to storm the party’s conference stage and pour glitter over Sir Keir Starmer.<br><br>Yaz Ashmawi, 28, a physicist turned Extinction Rebellion strategist, was arrested after he threw glitter over Starmer as he prepared to give his keynote speech.<br><br>• The key points and policies from Starmer’s speech and Labour conference<br><br>Ashmawi, who was representing the group People Demand Democracy and was wearing a T-shirt bearing its name, ran from the back of the hall to Starmer’s podium.<br><br>The Labour leader pushed Ashmawi — whose full name is Yasine El-Ashmawi — away from the microphone as the protester grabbed Starmer’s shoulder and wrist.<br><br>It took more than ten seconds for security staff to reach the pair. When they did, he was dropped to the floor and dragged away shouting, as Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, angrily said: “For god’s sake.”<br><br>Starmer has described the protester as an “idiot” and said he was “absolutely determined” to ignore him.<br><br>He told Times Radio on Wednesday: “I was absolutely determined that this wasn’t going to disrupt what has been four years of really hard work, getting the Labour Party from where we landed in 2019, which is a very bad place to this last conference before the general election, where we had to set out and did set out our positive case.”<br><br>He said he viewed the speech as a “culminating” moment. “I’ve always seen this as three stages. I took over three and a half years ago, picked it up off the floor. We had to change the party, expose the Tories and SNP as not fit to govern, then setting out the positive case, making the case that this doesn’t have to be another decade of decline.”<br><br>Starmer added: “I was determined we would get on with it. I just wanted to get on with the speech, and that’s why I rolled up my sleeves and got on with it. I didn’t want that idiot to interrupt that.”<br><br>Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, said on Tuesday that she had “never seen Rachel Reeves so angry” and told LBC: “I thought I was going to do a full John Prescott at one point.”<br><br>Prescott, as deputy prime minister in 2001, punched a protester who egged him during a pro-hunting rally in Rhyl.<br><br>A Labour source said that they were “really f***ing angry” over the slow response, adding: “If he had a weapon, Keir could’ve been killed.”<br><br>A senior party source blamed the Metropolitan Police, since Starmer has round-the-clock protection. The Times understands that Met officers were in the hall during his speech as well as security staff provided by the venue, ACC Liverpool.<br><br>The Met said that it did not comment on security matters. ACC Liverpool said that “highly trained stewarding and security teams ensured the incident was dealt with appropriately”.<br><br>People Demand Democracy has been linked to Just Stop Oil and is calling for a proportional voting system for elections and a “House of Citizens” to replace the House of Lords, selected by “democratic lottery”. A Just Stop Oil insider described the group, which was set up this year, as a “coalition member”.<br><br>A representative for People Demand Democracy, who gave her name as Aria, told Times Radio: “We’re rooted in non-violence so the action was designed not to cause harm.”<br><br>However, another Labour source said: “Security didn’t work today, for whatever reason, and that’s what we’ll be reviewing with urgency.”<br><br>Graham Wettone, a former Metropolitan Police officer, said: “Anyone who gets that close is clearly a breach in security. The risk and danger depends on a number of things. Clearly, there has been a breach of security.<br><br>“But you can’t have security standing right alongside Starmer and his protection officers acted quite quickly. It comes down to how closely you want your security. It depends on what your principal wants from you, balanced with an assessment of the threat.<br><br>“The action from the cops looks fairly reasonable to me and they dealt with him quickly and reasonably. But it’s a breach of the venue’s security and questions must be asked about how the protester was able to get onto the stage.”<br><br>Those attending the conference have to have a conference pass, issued after an accreditation process, and any bags have to be scanned or searched. The security arrangements are relatively light compared with the airport-style scanners in place at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.<br><br>A Labour spokesman said that Starmer was “fine” and “completely unfazed”. While cameras broadcasting the speech were cut as the incident unfolded, Starmer remained on stage while the man was removed. Carol Linforth, a veteran Labour staff member and the party’s director of events, helped Starmer to remove his jacket.<br><br>Starmer told members, who got to their feet to cheer and applaud: “If he thinks that bothers me, he doesn’t know me. Protest or power, that’s why we’ve changed our party, conference.”</p>

    <p>After the speech Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said that Labour was a “party of power, not protest”. She told BBC News: “It just shows, doesn’t it, that you can’t bother Keir Starmer with stuff like that. It’s about power not protest, that is what Keir Starmer was talking about. We’re a party of power not protest.”<br><br>Last month, People Demand Democracy gave Starmer and Rishi Sunak an ultimatum to implement its demands by September 30 or face “proportionate action”.<br><br>Ashmawi, who goes by the alias “Dove”, is from Surrey and holds two master’s degrees in theoretical physics, one from the University of St Andrews and the other from the University of Cambridge.<br><br>He attended primary school in Oxted, Surrey, before moving to Dubai and studying at Dubai College, one of the Middle East’s leading private schools which charges more than £24,000 a year.<br><br>After working as a web designer, videographer and photographer, he joined Extinction Rebellion full-time as a member of the group’s strategy team.<br><br>He has previously been at the forefront of XR’s protests and in one case led protesters in a march along the River Clyde in Glasgow during Cop 26. This year he told Yahoo News UK that XR had changed and that it was “not just blocking random junctions any more” and instead “coming to the centre of power”.<br><br>The ACC Liverpool group, which runs the venue where Labour is holding its annual conference, said it “recognises the rights of all groups and individuals to free speech and freedom of expression” but said the safety of its speakers and customers was of the “utmost importance”.<br><br>Shabana Mahmood, the shadow justice minister, told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme: “I’m sure questions are being asked. We will want to make sure that nothing like that can ever happen again.”<br><br>A spokesman for Merseyside police said that Ashmawi had been arrested on suspicion of a section 39 assault, breach of the peace and causing public nuisance, and would be questioned.<br><br>At 1.20pm, everything was going to plan for Labour’s PR machine (James Glossop, Times photographer, writes). A crowd of jolly placard-wielding activists was assembled to cheer as Sir Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria walked towards a dozen or so photographers and a TV crew. This was the early picture, provided to use before the speech begins to satisfy any publications with early deadlines. It also takes place in somewhere with a bit of natural light, not something that is in abundance at party conferences.<br><br>Forty-five minutes later, things were no longer going to plan. A protester strode on to the stage in Liverpool before Starmer had even started his speech, and threw glitter all over him. This is the kind of thing we photographers need to be ready for. Although the protester’s message wasn’t particularly clear and the subsequent reporting of the speech mentioned the incident only as a side-note, I would bet that it will be the main image from the speech used in most newspapers on Wednesday morning.<br><br>Shooting a political speech is all about reading the mood of the room, weighing up where the good backgrounds are and paying attention. The most important moments to pay attention are during the first five minutes and the last five minutes. This is when ordinarily wooden politicians may start getting animated and waving to no one in particular, hugging their colleagues, gesturing to the crowd, that kind of thing. Which all make better pictures than a talking head. Had the protest happened in the middle of the speech, it may have been missed by quite a few photographers.<br><br>I decided to shoot from the back of the room, on a TV platform I probably wasn’t supposed to be on, using my 100-400mm lens at 400mm. The platform allows enough height to get clear of the audience when they stand to applaud at the beginning. It’s normally sensible to keep “on” the speaker until the cadence of their speech shifts into a more regular rhythm, and they start moving through each of the many topics they feel obliged to cover.<br><br>After this had happened there really was no point in shooting any of the standard “man points while looking serious” type pictures, so I rushed back to the laptop to file the glitter images before the paper’s important afternoon meeting, also called “conference”. One of the set held the front of our website for several hours.<br><br>I was wondering after the event if the police or party security would be in trouble for not reacting quickly enough. Starmer’s reaction in the sequence of images shows what I read to be a certain amount of disbelief at what was happening, or at least that it took seemingly so long for someone to intervene. Labour are odds on by quite a margin to win the next election. Whether they win or not, my guess is that security will be quite a bit tighter at next year’s conference.</p>

    <p>Labour is urgently reviewing security arrangements after a protester was able to storm the party’s conference stage and pour glitter over Sir Keir Starmer.<br><br>Yaz Ashmawi, 28, a physicist turned Extinction Rebellion strategist, was arrested after he threw glitter over Starmer as he prepared to give his keynote speech.<br><br>• The key points and policies from Starmer’s speech and Labour conference<br><br>Ashmawi, who was representing the group People Demand Democracy and was wearing a T-shirt bearing its name, ran from the back of the hall to Starmer’s podium.<br><br>The Labour leader pushed Ashmawi — whose full name is Yasine El-Ashmawi — away from the microphone as the protester grabbed Starmer’s shoulder and wrist.<br><br>It took more than ten seconds for security staff to reach the pair. When they did, he was dropped to the floor and dragged away shouting, as Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, angrily said: “For god’s sake.”<br><br>Starmer has described the protester as an “idiot” and said he was “absolutely determined” to ignore him.<br><br>He told Times Radio on Wednesday: “I was absolutely determined that this wasn’t going to disrupt what has been four years of really hard work, getting the Labour Party from where we landed in 2019, which is a very bad place to this last conference before the general election, where we had to set out and did set out our positive case.”<br><br>He said he viewed the speech as a “culminating” moment. “I’ve always seen this as three stages. I took over three and a half years ago, picked it up off the floor. We had to change the party, expose the Tories and SNP as not fit to govern, then setting out the positive case, making the case that this doesn’t have to be another decade of decline.”<br><br>Starmer added: “I was determined we would get on with it. I just wanted to get on with the speech, and that’s why I rolled up my sleeves and got on with it. I didn’t want that idiot to interrupt that.”<br><br>Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, said on Tuesday that she had “never seen Rachel Reeves so angry” and told LBC: “I thought I was going to do a full John Prescott at one point.”<br><br>Prescott, as deputy prime minister in 2001, punched a protester who egged him during a pro-hunting rally in Rhyl.<br><br>A Labour source said that they were “really f***ing angry” over the slow response, adding: “If he had a weapon, Keir could’ve been killed.”<br><br>A senior party source blamed the Metropolitan Police, since Starmer has round-the-clock protection. The Times understands that Met officers were in the hall during his speech as well as security staff provided by the venue, ACC Liverpool.<br><br>The Met said that it did not comment on security matters. ACC Liverpool said that “highly trained stewarding and security teams ensured the incident was dealt with appropriately”.<br><br>People Demand Democracy has been linked to Just Stop Oil and is calling for a proportional voting system for elections and a “House of Citizens” to replace the House of Lords, selected by “democratic lottery”. A Just Stop Oil insider described the group, which was set up this year, as a “coalition member”.<br><br>A representative for People Demand Democracy, who gave her name as Aria, told Times Radio: “We’re rooted in non-violence so the action was designed not to cause harm.”<br><br>However, another Labour source said: “Security didn’t work today, for whatever reason, and that’s what we’ll be reviewing with urgency.”<br><br>Graham Wettone, a former Metropolitan Police officer, said: “Anyone who gets that close is clearly a breach in security. The risk and danger depends on a number of things. Clearly, there has been a breach of security.<br><br>“But you can’t have security standing right alongside Starmer and his protection officers acted quite quickly. It comes down to how closely you want your security. It depends on what your principal wants from you, balanced with an assessment of the threat.<br><br>“The action from the cops looks fairly reasonable to me and they dealt with him quickly and reasonably. But it’s a breach of the venue’s security and questions must be asked about how the protester was able to get onto the stage.”<br><br>Those attending the conference have to have a conference pass, issued after an accreditation process, and any bags have to be scanned or searched. The security arrangements are relatively light compared with the airport-style scanners in place at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.<br><br>A Labour spokesman said that Starmer was “fine” and “completely unfazed”. While cameras broadcasting the speech were cut as the incident unfolded, Starmer remained on stage while the man was removed. Carol Linforth, a veteran Labour staff member and the party’s director of events, helped Starmer to remove his jacket.<br><br>Starmer told members, who got to their feet to cheer and applaud: “If he thinks that bothers me, he doesn’t know me. Protest or power, that’s why we’ve changed our party, conference.”</p>

    <p>After the speech Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said that Labour was a “party of power, not protest”. She told BBC News: “It just shows, doesn’t it, that you can’t bother Keir Starmer with stuff like that. It’s about power not protest, that is what Keir Starmer was talking about. We’re a party of power not protest.”<br><br>Last month, People Demand Democracy gave Starmer and Rishi Sunak an ultimatum to implement its demands by September 30 or face “proportionate action”.<br><br>Ashmawi, who goes by the alias “Dove”, is from Surrey and holds two master’s degrees in theoretical physics, one from the University of St Andrews and the other from the University of Cambridge.<br><br>He attended primary school in Oxted, Surrey, before moving to Dubai and studying at Dubai College, one of the Middle East’s leading private schools which charges more than £24,000 a year.<br><br>After working as a web designer, videographer and photographer, he joined Extinction Rebellion full-time as a member of the group’s strategy team.<br><br>He has previously been at the forefront of XR’s protests and in one case led protesters in a march along the River Clyde in Glasgow during Cop 26. This year he told Yahoo News UK that XR had changed and that it was “not just blocking random junctions any more” and instead “coming to the centre of power”.<br><br>The ACC Liverpool group, which runs the venue where Labour is holding its annual conference, said it “recognises the rights of all groups and individuals to free speech and freedom of expression” but said the safety of its speakers and customers was of the “utmost importance”.<br><br>Shabana Mahmood, the shadow justice minister, told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme: “I’m sure questions are being asked. We will want to make sure that nothing like that can ever happen again.”<br><br>A spokesman for Merseyside police said that Ashmawi had been arrested on suspicion of a section 39 assault, breach of the peace and causing public nuisance, and would be questioned.<br><br>At 1.20pm, everything was going to plan for Labour’s PR machine (James Glossop, Times photographer, writes). A crowd of jolly placard-wielding activists was assembled to cheer as Sir Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria walked towards a dozen or so photographers and a TV crew. This was the early picture, provided to use before the speech begins to satisfy any publications with early deadlines. It also takes place in somewhere with a bit of natural light, not something that is in abundance at party conferences.<br><br>Forty-five minutes later, things were no longer going to plan. A protester strode on to the stage in Liverpool before Starmer had even started his speech, and threw glitter all over him. This is the kind of thing we photographers need to be ready for. Although the protester’s message wasn’t particularly clear and the subsequent reporting of the speech mentioned the incident only as a side-note, I would bet that it will be the main image from the speech used in most newspapers on Wednesday morning.<br><br>Shooting a political speech is all about reading the mood of the room, weighing up where the good backgrounds are and paying attention. The most important moments to pay attention are during the first five minutes and the last five minutes. This is when ordinarily wooden politicians may start getting animated and waving to no one in particular, hugging their colleagues, gesturing to the crowd, that kind of thing. Which all make better pictures than a talking head. Had the protest happened in the middle of the speech, it may have been missed by quite a few photographers.<br><br>I decided to shoot from the back of the room, on a TV platform I probably wasn’t supposed to be on, using my 100-400mm lens at 400mm. The platform allows enough height to get clear of the audience when they stand to applaud at the beginning. It’s normally sensible to keep “on” the speaker until the cadence of their speech shifts into a more regular rhythm, and they start moving through each of the many topics they feel obliged to cover.<br><br>After this had happened there really was no point in shooting any of the standard “man points while looking serious” type pictures, so I rushed back to the laptop to file the glitter images before the paper’s important afternoon meeting, also called “conference”. One of the set held the front of our website for several hours.<br><br>I was wondering after the event if the police or party security would be in trouble for not reacting quickly enough. Starmer’s reaction in the sequence of images shows what I read to be a certain amount of disbelief at what was happening, or at least that it took seemingly so long for someone to intervene. Labour are odds on by quite a margin to win the next election. Whether they win or not, my guess is that security will be quite a bit tighter at next year’s conference.</p>

    <p>On Tuesday morning, Jess Knowles carried her 20-month-old son Rico out of her terraced Victorian home in southwest London in a mad rush, conscious that she probably could not waste a minute if she was to make it on time to her child’s hospital appointment.<br><br>The stay-at-home mum was greeted by a disastrous sight after she walked over to the driver’s side of her black Jeep Night Eagle, a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that she uses through her disabled father’s mobility allowance — two deflated tyres.<br><br>After initially fearing that the tyres had been slashed, Knowles, 36, found that the valve caps had been stuffed to make them deflate, one with sunflower seeds and the other with crushed shards of pasta — a simple yet effective foil that meant that she could not make her son’s appointment.<br><br>Knowles’s car was one of over 40 SUVs and sports cars on the narrow tree-lined streets of Sands End to be targeted on Monday night by the Tyre Extinguishers, a group of activists aiming to “make it impossible” for city dwellers to drive “polluting death machines”.<br><br>The group, which launched in 2021, is a decentralised movement, with instructions on how to deflate a tyre with something as small as a lentil available on their website along with leaflets to be placed on people’s cars to explain the action.<br><br>Activists under the banner of the Tyre Extinguishers, who have no affiliation with campaign groups such as Just Stop Oil or Extinction Rebellion, have been taking their war to SUVs all over the world, including countries as far afield as Romania, America and Australia.<br><br>CCTV obtained by The Times showed three men wearing baseball caps tinkering with tyre valves in Sands End on Monday night, with the whole operation lasting just under a minute for each car.<br><br>“It’s so bad. They said that they’d keep doing it unless you change your vehicle,” Knowles said. “I’m looking out the window at night just to see if they’re outside. I don’t want anyone near my vehicle. They could put the wrong thing in there, they could flatten it for all I know… They don’t know why people need a vehicle.”.<br><br>Knowles did not display her badge when she parks at home because she has a residency permit, leaving her a target in the eyes of the Tyre Extinguishers, who claim to not target mobility vehicles if they see a disabled badge.<br><br>The action comes as The Times has learnt that Just Stop Oil, which has not held a protest since early December, will be launching a new campaign to lobby Labour candidates to sign a pledge that they will resign if a Labour government signs new oil and gas contracts.<br><br>The move represents a significant step by the group to engage in electoral politics. The Times understands that it was in part prompted by a belief that JSO had effectively sounded the alarm around the impact of new oil and gas contracts and that the next step would be political engagement.<br><br>A source told The Times that it represents a “diversification of tactics” and that “there was still a place for cultural actions” such as protests at the National Gallery.<br><br>“It’s about people in their community and in their regions kind of trying to take the power back and exercise their own autonomy to political actors that don’t represent them,” a source said.<br><br>“Given it’s an election year, politicians have to emerge from their shells. They have to crawl out the cracks and holes under the floorboards so we’re going to take this opportunity to engage with them directly,” the source added.<br><br>This comes as Roger Hallam, the co-founder of XR, Insulate Britain and JSO, has called for the need for balance in the climate movement and for activists to begin preparing for societal collapse.<br><br>The change, which is motivated by his belief that climate change will no longer be stopped, is a significant departure from Hallam’s previous position on the importance of public disruption to enact change, an approach that made him the architect one of the most disruptive and radical protest movements in modern British history.<br><br>In his New Year address, he told his followers he was working on a “profoundly different framing” for 2024.<br><br>“It goes something like: ‘Look, the carbon regime has totally f***ed up so the climate crisis is now locked in. We don’t need to create massive social disruption because it’s going to happen anyway! The regime will collapse under the weight of its own contradictions. So, what next? We need to build the next civilisation and stop fascism from taking us to a terminal hell’. Bit long but you get the idea,” he said.<br><br>Hallam said that he would outline different aspects of a “balanced revolution” by working on ideas such as how to hold public assemblies, how to door-knock and how to stand in elections.<br><br>“The mission is to empower people to see the big picture — one that transcends the traditional categories of politics, economics, social connection, and spirituality in favour of a new fusion of confrontation and dialogue,” he said.</p>

    <p>This also comes as the Reverend Mark Coleman, a climate campaigner who has twice been jailed for participating in Insulate Britain and JSO actions, stands for election in the upcoming Rochdale by-election.<br><br>Gail Bradbrook, another co-founder of XR, told The Times that the climate protest movement was incredibly focused on “preparing for the collapse of civilisation” by creating local assemblies to make decisions for the best of their community.<br><br>Bradbrook said that XR’s announcement last year that it would move away from disruptive tactics such as roadblocks and smashing windows was partly adopted because the tactic was being done by JSO.<br><br>“We [the climate protest movement] have to be more like nature,” she said. “Nature has ecosystems. It has different creatures for different purposes and they come alive at different times for different seasons.”<br><br>However, some experts believe that JSO has not been successful in holding protests of note in recent months and that this stagnation could give way to a newer more radical group to grow out of it.<br><br>Dr Paul Stott, of the Policy Exchange think tank, said that JSO has had little momentum in recent months due to its members being embroiled in legal battles, leaving the group needing to reinvent itself after running out of activists.<br><br>Last year during JSO’s last wave of action, the Metropolitan Police arrested 630 protesters from October 30 to December 4, with JSO data showing at least 276 people charged, more than 120 of whom under section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, a new power that bans any action that “interferes with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure”. Some cases arising in 2023 are now being listed in the crown court in 2025.<br><br>On Monday, three trials are due to begin involving climate activists, including five XR protesters charged with criminal damage for breaking glass at JP Morgan’s European Headquarters in 2021, eight Insulate Britain campaigners charged with public nuisance for stopping traffic on the M25 in the same year, and five JSO activists charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance for occupying tunnels close to Grays Oil Terminal in 2022.<br><br>This comes before the Court of Appeal considering whether the protesters can argue as a defence their belief that the property owner would have consented to the damage caused if they had been fully aware of the impact of climate change. The case has been prompted by the attorney-general, Victoria Prentis KC, after a spate of acquittals of protesters who have defaced buildings.<br><br>“One of the problems they’ve had is they’ve had so many court cases and people being arrested, re-arrested and convicted. Once organisations get into that position it becomes tricky,” Stott said. “They’ve been tied up in prison support campaigns and that sort of prison support although it’s necessary to maintain the morale of the group and its prisoners and their families, it rather saps the energy out of the campaigns”.<br><br>“One thing Roger Hallam tends to do is start campaigns and those campaigns have a high profile,” he said. “Insulate Britain for example hadn’t achieved its aims but the campaign petered out and was replaced by Just Stop Oil. It is more likely that another organisation will be started this summer, will flare, have some success, and fade again”.<br><br>However, some in the wider climate movement believe that there is growing awareness that a polarising approach will not bear fruit in trying to prevent climate change and prepare for the impact it will have on the world.<br><br>Rupert Read, a former member of XR and a founder of the Climate Majority Project, said that the group, which aims to bring the public along with it has welcomed a significant number of people with backgrounds in XR, Insulate Britain and JSO on to its email lists.<br><br>“The climate movement is moving in the direction of understanding that engagement needs to be much wider and that the majority of people ultimately need to be onside for this to work. You can’t win by [being] endlessly polarising,” he told The Times.<br><br>“There’s always going to be space for civil disobedience and the situation that we’re in merits all kinds of approaches to be tried. But it is absolutely imperative that we get more and more people onside, that we depolarize, that we ensure that climate is not a culture war issue.”<br><br>“What we’re trying to do fits in with the change in XR strategy last year to a somewhat more moderate direction… there is a lot of people a lot of thoughtful people from XR who understand what’s going on and can smell the coffee… ultimately, you have to do something more than raise the alarm.”</p>

        <h1>Just Stop Oil activists jailed after M25 blocked</h1><p>Five environmental activists who aimed to &quot;create mass disruption&quot; have been jailed for their role in protests that caused widespread traffic disruption on the M25.<br><br>The Just Stop Oil campaigners climbed gantries on the motorway in November 2022, forcing police to stop the traffic, in an attempt to cause gridlock across southern England. People &quot;suffered hours of delay&quot; on 9 November 2022 as a result, Basildon Crown Court heard.<br><br>All the defendants, who pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to causing a public nuisance, received terms of between one year eight months and two years. The defendants were all either retired, students or recent graduates at the time, the court heard.<br><br>Judge Shane Collery KC noted that an accident happened near one gantry and it was &quot;fortunate more accidents did not occur&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s easy to be blasé and dismissive when it&#x27;s not your life that&#x27;s being disrupted,&quot; he said. He said the protesters &quot;considered you knew better than everyone else&quot;, and suggested an element may have been &quot;the day out and perhaps the excitement of a day&#x27;s action&quot;.</p>

Prosecutors at York Magistrates&#x27; Court said Mr Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty were left with a bill of just under £3,000 for repairs.<br><br>But District Judge Adrian Lower concluded the evidence against the defendants was &quot;so tenuous&quot; that no court would convict them. Defence lawyer Owen Greenhall argued it could not be proved the roof damage was caused during the protest, telling the court: &quot;It&#x27;s clear this is a roof where there is pre-existing damage in areas where the protesters did not go&quot;.</p>

    <p><br><br>During the trial, it was found that three of the 15 pictures used by the prosecution were actually of the same tile taken from different angles, and some had been taken after repairs had been carried out.<br><br>Greenpeace said its demonstration was a response to plans to allow new licences to be granted for further development of North Sea oil and gas off the coast of Scotland.<br><br>Outside court, defendant Michael Grant said: &quot;Justice and common sense prevailed in court today. Peaceful protest is a vital part of our democracy.&quot; He said the activists had targeted Mr Sunak&#x27;s home because it was a &quot;personal&quot; decision for him to issue new fossil fuel licences, adding they knew the then-prime minister and his family were on holiday at the time.</p>

    <p>Just Stop Oil activists are plotting to cause summer misery for thousands of holidaymakers. The environmental group plans to wreak havoc at airports here and across Europe from mid-June.<br><br>Protesters will halt flights by storming terminal buildings, glueing themselves to runways and clambering onto jets in tourist hotspots like Spain, Greece and Turkey. It means travellers will likely face agonising delays here – while those lucky enough to take off could be forced to wait hours on the runway on the other side.<br><br>Last night, MPs and travel experts accused the group of “shooting itself in the foot” by causing misery and risking lives. Our undercover reporter learned of the plot at a meeting attended by some 50 hardcore activists. Just Stop Oil’s so-called poster girl, Phoebe Plummer, was greeted by roars as she announced “disruption on a scale that has never been seen before”.<br><br>She added: “The most exciting part of this plan is that [it’s] going to be part of an international effort. Flights operate on such a tight schedule to control air traffic that with action being caused in cities all around the world we’re talking about radical, unignorable disruption.”<br><br>Privately educated Plummer, who grew up in London’s posh Chelsea, has been arrested for a string of disturbances that include throwing soup at a Vincent van Gogh painting in the National Gallery. The pink-haired 22-year-old spent time in prison last year and was re-arrested a ­fortnight ago for breaking her bail conditions by posting a letter through the door of Labour MP Emily Thornberry.<br><br>Plummer’s shouty speech continued: “It’s time to wake up and get real – no summer holiday is more important than food security, housing and the lives of your loved ones. Flying is also a symbol of the gross wealth inequality that’s plaguing our society and if we want to create change we need to adopt a more radical demand.”<br><br>Just Stop Oil will team up with Europe-based eco mob the A22 Network to stage protests at major international airports. Last year, protesters from member group Last Generation spray-painted a private jet orange and glued themselves to runways in Germany. It later emerged the anti-fossil fuel group Network netted over £400,000 from billionaire oil heiress Aileen Getty.<br><br>The plot was last night widely blasted as being a selfish own goal. Clive Wratten, of the Business Travel Association, said: “These planned protests are a blunt instrument that will alienate the people who can bring the change Just Stop Oil wants. The activists should work with British businesses to create meaningful solutions to our climate crisis.</p>

    <p>“They should join airlines and their supply industry in bringing forward sustainable fuels and best practices, and we urge protesters to reconsider chaos bringing progress to a standstill.”<br><br>Gary Johnson, Tory MP for Dartford, branded the strategy “dangerous” and “selfish”, adding: “The actions of Just Stop Oil are counterproductive and put people off their cause. Most people want to see the environment protected but militant, highly disruptive protests just anger those who are often just trying to enjoy a family holiday.”<br><br>One fed-up holidaymaker added: “After the last couple of years, everyone needs a break. If this goes ahead it will be an absolute kick in the teeth for families.”<br><br>Some 51% of us plan to travel abroad this summer and three in five have already booked, according to Post Office Travel Money. Some 940,000 flights left the UK in 2023 and aviation contributes over £22billion to the economy, Government figures show. The planned action comes after passengers were told to expect chaos in the coming months due to staff shortages in air traffic departments.<br><br>Just Stop Oil was founded in 2022 to try to halt all new oil, gas and coal licences in the UK. Its previous protests include halting traffic on busy roads, targeting an Ashes Test match at Lords and storming on stage during a performance of Les Miserables in the West End.<br><br>Justifying the group’s actions, a Just Stop Oil spokesman said: “In normal circumstances, the sort of activities you’ve outlined would be unacceptable. However, what is more unacceptable is the last 10 straight months of record-breaking temperatures, governments continue to allow more oil and gas drilling. The situation is an emergency and we have to start acting like it.”<br><br>But Home Secretary James Cleverly criticised Just Stop Oil’s “unacceptable guerrilla tactics”, adding: “Selfish, disruptive protesters who wreak havoc in people’s everyday lives must be stopped. We have given the police more powers to tackle criminals posing as protesters and are backing officers with the tools they need to prevent serious disruption and disorder. More than 600 protesters were arrested during Just Stop Oil’s latest campaign.”</p>

    <p>In the 1970s, a small group of Greenpeace activists had a unique idea for how they could put an end to commercial whaling.<br><br>A large Soviet vessel, harpoon gun poised to fire, looms over a whale immediately below the bow, the animal&#x27;s large gaping wound oozing blood into the cold Pacific Ocean.<br><br>It&#x27;s an image that changed the world and marked the beginning of Greenpeace&#x27;s &quot;mind bomb&quot; campaign, says Rex Weyler, the photographer behind the 1975 photo (scroll down to see that iconic shot below).<br><br>Weyler was among the early members of Greenpeace who met in Canada during the 1970s. Many of them, including Weyler, had left the US to escape being drafted for the Vietnamese War. &quot;It&#x27;s so hard to imagine today but at that time there was no ecology movement,&quot; he remembers. &quot;There was the peace movement, the women&#x27;s movement, the civil rights movement, and we felt there needed to be a conservation movement on the same scale as those.&quot;<br><br>Weyler found out about the plight of the whales through a Canadian author doing a book tour at the time.<br><br>&quot;At the time people thought whaling was this Moby Dick image. Little men in these little boats facing these giant whales. The whales were Goliath,&quot; he says. &quot;We wanted to flip that Goliath image around because by the 1970s, whalers had giant boats with fast diesel motors and exploding 250lb (113kg) harpoons. And we wanted to capture that image.&quot;<br><br>Whaling peaked in the 1960s, with approximately 80,000 whales being hunted every year. Hunting technology had advanced and whalers had harpoons and ships that could outrun whales.<br><br>Despite various whaling protection measures being introduced, including the International Agreement of the Regulation of Whaling in 1937, some countries, such as Russia and Japan, ignored them and caught whales illegally. Between 1900 and 1999, an estimated 2.9 million large whales were caught and killed by the industrial whaling operations, although the actual numbers are believed to be much higher.<br><br>&quot;Already in the 1960s, the rapid decline of whale stocks worldwide was clear,&quot; says Árni Finnsson, chair of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association and a lifelong ocean activistwho worked for Greenpeace Sweden in the early 1990s. &quot;Although the hunt for blue whales in the North Atlantic was banned by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1954, the management structure was weak and the excessive whaling continued.&quot;<br><br>In 1972, Finnsson explains, the UN Conference on the Human Environment called for a 10-year moratorium on whaling. &quot;The IWC disregarded this call by the international community and Greenpeace took action, at sea, in order to protest this ruthless exploitation, notably against Soviet whaling vessels in the Pacific,&quot; he says.<br><br>The newly formed Greenpeace had spent two or three years preparing the boat and a crew. &quot;In 1975 we set out in little Zodiac inflatable boats to find a whaling fleet,&quot; Weyler says. &quot;The whole idea of our campaigns at that time was media. So we decided we were going to blockade the whaling boats, and get between the whales and the harpoon. So off we go, looking for the whalers, and we found the Russian whaling fleet off the coast of California.&quot;<br><br>Many of the group had some experience with the media and they knew they needed striking photos for this confrontation to become a global news story. They soon termed these kinds of campaigns &quot;mind bombs&quot; – an idea that would become the cornerstone of Greenpeace campaigning, Weyler explains. The mind bomb, something dreamt up by Bob Hunter, another early member of Greenpeace, revolved around the media being a global delivery system for ideas. Revolution wasn&#x27;t an armed struggle, according to Hunter, it was a communications struggle, where mind bombs were the weapons – rather than actual bombs.</p>

    <p>&quot;We knew we had to take photos, we knew it had to be dramatic. That was the whole purpose of making this dramatic gesture – to record it so this would become a news story and we could talk about the plight of the world&#x27;s whales,&quot; says Weyler.<br><br>But it wasn&#x27;t easy. &quot;We all had to learn how to take photographs and shoot films from a small moving boat on a choppy ocean,&quot; he says. &quot;We stood at the bow of the Zodiac with a line around our waist to secure us. We could lean back against that line and kind of become our own tripod and absorb the movement of the boat so we could hold the camera steady.&quot;<br><br>More like this:<br><br>Catching the whales on camera was the biggest challenge. &quot;They were being chased by harpoon boats so they would rise to the surface, breathe out, breathe in, and dive again.&quot; There wasn&#x27;t much to photograph, Weyler adds, until the whales had been hit by a harpoon.<br><br>&quot;My awareness was mostly focused on exposure, shutter speed, those things,&quot; he says. It was only after he&#x27;d put down his camera that what he had witnessed hit him.<br><br>&quot;It was devastating. We had never seen anything like it. We saw [the whaling boats] harpoon whales, there was massive amounts of blood in the water, and whales flapping and splashing as they struggled and then died.<br><br>&quot;We were ripped up inside. I recall being on the deck of the main Greenpeace boat and looking out across the water and feeling gut-wrenched. Devastated at the reality of what we had just witnessed.&quot;<br><br>When the crew landed at a port in San Francisco, the dock was swamped with media, Weyler recalls. &quot;We weren&#x27;t prepared for that kind of response. Everybody wanted the images.&quot;<br><br>Weyler remembers waking up early the next morning and going to a newsstand to see if his image had made the papers. &quot;I was so excited because I was wondering if we&#x27;d made it. And I walked the streets until I found a newsstand, and the photograph was on the front page of virtually every newspaper. It was a stunning moment. It had been our dream.&quot;<br><br>For Weyler, the point of the photographs was to show protestors &quot;not just standing up for human rights or peace&quot; but for other species. &quot;Change comes when the population insists on it,&quot; he says. &quot;And we were attempting to inspire the population to rise up and to say to the government, &#x27;We have to preserve these species.&#x27; I feel that in many ways this particular image really helped create the global climate movement we have today.&quot;<br><br>After Greenpeace&#x27;s whaling campaign, a moratorium on commercial whaling was finally implemented by the International Whaling Committee in 1982, followed by a ban in 1985. As a result, some of the bigger whaling species, such as humpbacks, have made a remarkable recovery – to 93% of their pre-industrial-hunting populations.<br><br>Commercial whaling does still happen, though – namely by Iceland, Norway and Japan.<br><br>&quot;Greenpeace&#x27;s actions inspired the public,&quot; Finnsson says, &quot;and in 1982 Greenpeace and other non-profits were instrumental in achieving a moratorium on commercial whaling, which still stands.&quot;<br><br>--<br><br>For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.</p>

    <p>As a young woman, few things worried Louise Lancaster more than the idea of letting people down or doing something embarrassing. Having been one of the co-organisers of the protest that reduced parts of the M25 to gridlock over four days in November 2022, it seems that in later life she managed to overcome those challenges.<br><br>“For the woman I married to become the woman she is now, she’s had to go against the principles she was raised with,” says her former husband Tim Lancaster. “To get to the stage where she could face off a police officer and risk arrest … all of that was hard for her. Really hard. The fact she was going to inconvenience people was the most difficult part. She wouldn’t have done it if she’d been able to see another way.”<br><br>Together for 28 years until their amicable split last year, Tim, 57, who worked in IT, and Louise, 58, a special educational needs co-ordinator before her retirement two years ago, became involved in climate change activism in 2019. They joined marches, signed petitions and wrote to their local MP.<br><br>“For a while we thought people were noticing,” Tim says. “But Lou said to me, ‘Look, we did all of that and nothing changed — we have to do something else.’ Around 2020 she started to see non-violent direct action as a way of getting the government’s attention. “Lou studied maths at Oxford. She looks at data and she works things out. She thought about it very carefully.”<br><br>Handing down record sentences for non-violent protest earlier this month, Judge Christopher Hehir told the court that Louise and her co-conspirators, Roger Hallam, 58, Daniel Shaw, 38, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, and Cressida Gethin, 22, had “some time ago … crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic” before they attended a Zoom meeting in which they planned to recruit 45 volunteers to climb gantries over the M25.<br><br>The judge described the protest as causing “massive disruption”, including missed exams, funerals and cancer appointments. It allegedly cost the Met Police £1.1m and impacted around 700,000 vehicles, leaving the motorway “compromised” for more than 120 hours. Lancaster did not herself take part, but she had climbed a gantry on the M25 in an earlier protest in July 2022.<br><br>On the Zoom call, Hallam, the co-founder of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, said that they intended to cause “the biggest disruption in British modern history” in an effort to force the government to meet one of Just Stop Oil’s core demands: an end to new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.<br><br>In a decision that has provoked fierce debate, Hallam was jailed for five years for compromising to cause a public nuisance, while Louise, who paid more than £1,000 to rent the Airbnb where protesters stayed, and also bought climbing equipment, was sentenced to four, along with Shaw, Whittaker De Abreu and Gethin.<br><br>With Tim on our video call on Thursday night are the couple’s three grown-up children. Tristan, 27, is a software engineer; Verity, 25, is a midwife; and Theo, 19, is a medical student. They are bunched together, legs dangling off the edge of a single bed in the family home in the village of Grantchester, near Cambridge. Tim and Louise divorced in November but remain good friends.<br><br>“Whenever I think of my mum I think: unrelentingly kind,” Theo says. “In almost any situation she will put others first.”</p>

    <p>Tristan, Theo and Tim visited Louise in Bronzefield, a female prison that houses category-A prisoners in Surrey, on Monday afternoon. “I’d had an interview for a summer job and the first thing she asked was, ‘How did it go?’” Theo says. “With me being the youngest, she has always been very open about what might happen and took into account my thoughts. She cares about us — if we’d said, ‘Mum, don’t do it,’ she wouldn’t have taken part.”<br><br>Verity visited the previous Tuesday, two days before the sentencing on July 18, along with Louise’s worried elderly father, a retired art teacher with whom, Tim says, she has had some pretty fiery exchanges. “He said he felt her activism has ‘let the family down’.”<br><br>“I gave her a hug and then burst into tears,” Verity says. “Mum broke into a massive smile and said, ‘I’m going to be fine.’ She told me she’d been helping other women filling out forms and she was going to do some online courses and work on her pull-ups.” Her brothers fall about laughing at this. “It’s very not-Mum.”<br><br>“She expected that this might happen,” Tim explains, “and she prepared herself and everyone else for it.” Nonetheless the family was shocked at the length of the sentence. “To get a sentence that is way longer than you’d get for violent crime [the average UK sentence for violent crime is 21.6 months]. It feels terribly unjust.” The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 allows such harsher punishments to be imposed.<br><br>Under the Public Order Act 2023, provisions also came into effect earlier this year that give the police more power to clamp down on disruptive protests. Did they not wish that Louise had done something else? Lobbying parliament perhaps? Or chaining herself to railings? “She has — and it hasn’t been enough,” Tristan insists. “Big Oil has known for decades that burning fossil fuels is dangerous but has carried on regardless, and successive governments have done nothing to stop it.”<br><br>The family is not sure if there will be an appeal against the sentences, but so far a crowdfunder has raised £60,000 to pay for legal fees. The cost would be hundreds of thousands of pounds. Instead they are pinning their hopes on the new government looking at the law. “I never thought as an Englishman I’d ever see rules as draconian as this in my country,” Tim says. “But Lou is resigned to doing her time.”<br><br>Louise was initially struggled to get any vegan protein or exercise in prison. But speaking to her on Friday, Tim reported back that she had at last received some suitable food.<br><br>In the course of her activism, Louise has incurred fines of more than £20,000, which she will struggle to pay off. She’s been strip-searched, handcuffed face-down and the house has been raided more than once by police. The emotional cost to the family is high. “Johnny and I are getting married next summer, Mum’s gutted to miss it. Maybe she’ll get out with a tag and she can wear a long dress,” Verity says, a little too brightly.<br><br>Tim describes Louise as a sensitive soul, someone who “listens more than she speaks”. Could Louise be in so deep she can’t see the wood for the trees? Verity says not. “She knew what she was putting people through. And it was a big moral dilemma. Her position was that there is a much bigger disaster at stake — if we don’t act quickly — than people being late for school and work.”</p>

By the time they returned to the streets of London after lockdowns, it seemed the world had stopped paying attention.<br><br>Their demands were too scattered, and even thousands of protesters could barely make a dent on newspaper headlines, evening bulletins and the ecosystem of politics chat shows. It left a sense of frustration ripe for recruitment in existing activist circles.<br><br>‘Extinction Rebellion seemed a bit lost at the time’, said a mum-of-two in London who joined Just Stop Oil in the summer of 2022. She wants to stay anonymous, so we’ll call her Olivia.<br><br>‘Someone from Just Stop Oil walked into a local Extinction Rebellion meeting and I thought, “These guys sound like they’ve got a plan”.’<br><br>Three months later, Olivia was sat on a road wearing a hi-vis jacket and holding banners with other JSO activists, facing down angry drivers.<br><br>‘It was scary’, she told Metro. ‘But I also felt like this is what I need to be doing.’<br><br>Although JSO founder Roger Hallam once told a room full of left-wing activists that the reason they’re losing is ‘You’re all a bunch of f***ing c***s’, his plan was never to be liked.<br><br>He wanted attention on climate change, on Just Stop Oil, and on its key demands – an end to the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.<br><br>And he got it, the first part at least – a government ban on new oil and gas drilling in the North Sea, a victory shared by several campaign groups, is tainted by the government’s support for airport expansions.<br><br>Within months of their first stunt, more than 90% of Brits at least knew they existed – making them more famous than Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves.<br><br>‘Some mainstream campaigns could never dream of getting that level of awareness that quickly’, Sam Nadel, interim director of the Social Change Lab, which tracks the impact of protest movements on public opinion, told Metro.<br><br>Up Next<br><br>With a does-what-it-says-on-the-tin name, JSO struck gold on the airwaves, despite the coverage focusing on angry drivers, blocked ambulances, arrests, charges and jail sentences.<br><br>‘Even when you’re getting media coverage that’s incredibly negative, when the media is writing about your group, they also have no choice but to include your demand – I think that’s quite a savvy strategy’, Sam said.<br><br>The problem is, keeping the spotlight means changing tactics every time the public gets bored.<br><br>‘Often the most illogical protests get the most media coverage’, Sam said. ‘Things like shutting down a sporting event or throwing soup on a Van Gogh painting.’<br><br>But increasingly that drew the ire of both the British public – 64% hold an unfavourable view of JSO – and the government, which passed new laws to criminalise protests.<br><br>The Conservative government increased the penalty for willful obstruction of a highway from a £200 fine to a maximum of 51 weeks in prison, with a potential 10-year sentence for causing ‘public nuisance’.<br><br>It then handed the police sweeping powers to define and restrict ‘seriously disruptive’ protests, banning tactics like attaching yourself to another person or object, obstructing major transport works and key national infrastructure, and causing ‘serious annoyance’.</p>

    <p>Under this law, police arrested dozens of people planning to disrupt airports like Manchester and Gatwick last summer.<br><br>Then Hallam and four other JSO activists were handed four-year prison sentences after blocking the M25 motorway for four days in 2022.<br><br>Two months later, two activists were jailed for throwing tin of Heinz tomato soup on the glass cover of Vincent Van Gogh’s 1888 Sunflower painting at the National Gallery.<br><br>Convicted of criminal damage, Phoebe Plummer, 22, was handed a two-year sentence while Anna Holland, also 22, was jailed for 20 months.<br><br>They are among the 173 climate activists sent to prison for non-violent offences in the UK since 2021, according to Rebels In Prison Support.<br><br>It has chilled the movement. Tim Crosland, a former government lawyer turned climate activist, told Metro: ‘There are only so many people who are going to be in a position to go, you know, yes, I’m okay with a four-year prison sentence.<br><br>‘And once those people are in prison, there are not so many left.’<br><br>Olivia had already been arrested four times, resulting in two convictions, two acquittals and luckily no prison time. She sat out the airport campaign.<br><br>So did Stephanie, who had been arrested eight times, with a suspended sentence and 200 hours of community service for smashing petrol pumps in 2022.<br><br>Up Next<br><br>‘It’d been different years before when we were blocking oil terminals’, Stephanie said.<br><br>‘You knew that you’d get arrested, and you’d get in trouble, but you wouldn’t necessarily go to prison for that. There wasn’t that fear at all. I didn’t think about that.<br><br>‘Whereas with the airports, it was very likely, and I think that put a stop to more people signing up. Yeah, I think they really did struggle with recruitment for that.’<br><br>That may be ‘the real reason’ JSO has announced an end to its campaign, according to Dr Oscar Berglund, an expert on climate change activism at the University of Bristol.<br><br>He told Metro: ‘They just don’t have enough people to do the kind of actions that they have been doing.<br><br>‘People are put off, people are in prison, we’ve seen the criminalisation of protest – with a combination of repression and unpopularity, it’s difficult to renew as a movement.’<br><br>Many may have found Just Stop Oil’s activism aggravating, but it actually increased support for more mainstream groups like Extinction Rebellion, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace. That more moderate direction is where a large chunk of JSO activists may go.<br><br>Olivia has turned to ‘much lower risk demonstrations’, like disrupting Shell’s annual general meeting and protesting outside the Department for Transport to oppose airport expansions.<br><br>Stephanie says her activism will be more local from now on, focusing on ‘extortionate housing costs’, rising bills and inequality.<br><br>‘I personally don’t think we have gained any wins’, she said. ‘As much as JSO will say that there has been a big win with Labour stopping new oil and gas licenses, I don’t actually think that’s true at all. I think they finally realized that what they’ve done isn’t working.’<br><br>But there are those who – when faced with the question of ‘go hard or go home’ in the face of police crackdowns, like JSO was – choose to go hard, picking sabotage over disruption.<br><br>Already groups like Shut The System have cut fibre-optic cables to try and force insurance companies to stop funding fossil fuel companies by cutting off their internet access.<br><br>Tim said: ‘The real danger when you treat peaceful protest as being equivalent to serious crime is, it doesn’t go away – it takes other potentially more extreme forms.’<br><br>Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.<br><br>For more stories like this, check our news page.<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: Why on earth has an Australian MP just whapped out a salmon in parliament?<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: Protester’s ‘we have 1028 days left’ countdown runs out in hours – what will happen?<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: UK to plant 20,000,000 trees to create first new national forest in 30 years<br><br>Stay on top of the headlines with daily email updates.<br><br>This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

She wants to stay anonymous, so we’ll call her Olivia.<br><br>‘Someone from Just Stop Oil walked into a local Extinction Rebellion meeting and I thought, “These guys sound like they’ve got a plan”.’<br><br>Three months later, Olivia was sat on a road wearing a hi-vis jacket and holding banners with other JSO activists, facing down angry drivers.<br><br>‘It was scary’, she told Metro. ‘But I also felt like this is what I need to be doing.’<br><br>Although JSO founder Roger Hallam once told a room full of left-wing activists that the reason they’re losing is ‘You’re all a bunch of f***ing c***s’, his plan was never to be liked.<br><br>He wanted attention on climate change, on Just Stop Oil, and on its key demands – an end to the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.<br><br>And he got it, the first part at least – a government ban on new oil and gas drilling in the North Sea, a victory shared by several campaign groups, is tainted by the government’s support for airport expansions.<br><br>Within months of their first stunt, more than 90% of Brits at least knew they existed – making them more famous than Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves.<br><br>‘Some mainstream campaigns could never dream of getting that level of awareness that quickly’, Sam Nadel, interim director of the Social Change Lab, which tracks the impact of protest movements on public opinion, told Metro.<br><br>Up Next<br><br>With a does-what-it-says-on-the-tin name, JSO struck gold on the airwaves, despite the coverage focusing on angry drivers, blocked ambulances, arrests, charges and jail sentences.<br><br>‘Even when you’re getting media coverage that’s incredibly negative, when the media is writing about your group, they also have no choice but to include your demand – I think that’s quite a savvy strategy’, Sam said.<br><br>The problem is, keeping the spotlight means changing tactics every time the public gets bored.<br><br>‘Often the most illogical protests get the most media coverage’, Sam said. ‘Things like shutting down a sporting event or throwing soup on a Van Gogh painting.’<br><br>But increasingly that drew the ire of both the British public – 64% hold an unfavourable view of JSO – and the government, which passed new laws to criminalise protests.<br><br>The Conservative government increased the penalty for willful obstruction of a highway from a £200 fine to a maximum of 51 weeks in prison, with a potential 10-year sentence for causing ‘public nuisance’.<br><br>It then handed the police sweeping powers to define and restrict ‘seriously disruptive’ protests, banning tactics like attaching yourself to another person or object, obstructing major transport works and key national infrastructure, and causing ‘serious annoyance’.</p>

    <p>Under this law, police arrested dozens of people planning to disrupt airports like Manchester and Gatwick last summer.<br><br>Then Hallam and four other JSO activists were handed four-year prison sentences after blocking the M25 motorway for four days in 2022.<br><br>Two months later, two activists were jailed for throwing tin of Heinz tomato soup on the glass cover of Vincent Van Gogh’s 1888 Sunflower painting at the National Gallery.<br><br>Convicted of criminal damage, Phoebe Plummer, 22, was handed a two-year sentence while Anna Holland, also 22, was jailed for 20 months.<br><br>They are among the 173 climate activists sent to prison for non-violent offences in the UK since 2021, according to Rebels In Prison Support.<br><br>It has chilled the movement. Tim Crosland, a former government lawyer turned climate activist, told Metro: ‘There are only so many people who are going to be in a position to go, you know, yes, I’m okay with a four-year prison sentence.<br><br>‘And once those people are in prison, there are not so many left.’<br><br>Olivia had already been arrested four times, resulting in two convictions, two acquittals and luckily no prison time. She sat out the airport campaign.<br><br>So did Stephanie, who had been arrested eight times, with a suspended sentence and 200 hours of community service for smashing petrol pumps in 2022.<br><br>Up Next<br><br>‘It’d been different years before when we were blocking oil terminals’, Stephanie said.<br><br>‘You knew that you’d get arrested, and you’d get in trouble, but you wouldn’t necessarily go to prison for that. There wasn’t that fear at all. I didn’t think about that.<br><br>‘Whereas with the airports, it was very likely, and I think that put a stop to more people signing up. Yeah, I think they really did struggle with recruitment for that.’<br><br>That may be ‘the real reason’ JSO has announced an end to its campaign, according to Dr Oscar Berglund, an expert on climate change activism at the University of Bristol.<br><br>He told Metro: ‘They just don’t have enough people to do the kind of actions that they have been doing.<br><br>‘People are put off, people are in prison, we’ve seen the criminalisation of protest – with a combination of repression and unpopularity, it’s difficult to renew as a movement.’<br><br>Many may have found Just Stop Oil’s activism aggravating, but it actually increased support for more mainstream groups like Extinction Rebellion, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace. That more moderate direction is where a large chunk of JSO activists may go.<br><br>Olivia has turned to ‘much lower risk demonstrations’, like disrupting Shell’s annual general meeting and protesting outside the Department for Transport to oppose airport expansions.<br><br>Stephanie says her activism will be more local from now on, focusing on ‘extortionate housing costs’, rising bills and inequality.<br><br>‘I personally don’t think we have gained any wins’, she said. ‘As much as JSO will say that there has been a big win with Labour stopping new oil and gas licenses, I don’t actually think that’s true at all. I think they finally realized that what they’ve done isn’t working.’<br><br>But there are those who – when faced with the question of ‘go hard or go home’ in the face of police crackdowns, like JSO was – choose to go hard, picking sabotage over disruption.<br><br>Already groups like Shut The System have cut fibre-optic cables to try and force insurance companies to stop funding fossil fuel companies by cutting off their internet access.<br><br>Tim said: ‘The real danger when you treat peaceful protest as being equivalent to serious crime is, it doesn’t go away – it takes other potentially more extreme forms.’<br><br>Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.<br><br>For more stories like this, check our news page.<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: Why on earth has an Australian MP just whapped out a salmon in parliament?<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: Protester’s ‘we have 1028 days left’ countdown runs out in hours – what will happen?<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: UK to plant 20,000,000 trees to create first new national forest in 30 years<br><br>Stay on top of the headlines with daily email updates.<br><br>This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

    <p>Just Stop Oil activists have halted a West End performance of Les Miserables by invading the stage.<br><br>During a performance of the song One Day More, which involves waving a red flag, a group of four protesters stormed the stage and unfurled their own Just Stop Oil flag instead, to widespread boos from the crowd.<br><br>The protesters then chained themselves to the stage with bicycle locks, prompting the performance to be halted for around 20 minutes as the cast were forced backstage and the audience were ushered outside.<br><br>Among the protesters was 23 year old community worker Hannah Taylor, who said: ‘The show starts with Jean Valjean stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister’s starving child. How long before we are all forced to steal loaves of bread?<br><br>Up Next<br><br>‘How long before there are riots on the streets? The show cannot go on. We are facing catastrophe. New oil and gas means crop failure, starvation and death. It is an act of war on the global south and an utter betrayal of young people.’<br><br>She added: ‘Rishi Sunak has just approved Rosebank, a new oil project in the north sea which will produce as much carbon as the annual emissions of the 28 lowest-income countries combined. It will lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths due to starvation as crops fail in the increasingly extreme weather conditions.’<br><br>‘Am I not, like Jean Valjean, justified in breaking the law to oppose this criminal government and its murderous policies? Ask yourself, will you, like the citizens of Paris in the play, stand by and watch, or will you stand up against our governments’ criminal plans and call for an end to new oil and gas?’<br><br>Also in attendance was 19-year-old student Poppy Bliss from, Nottingham, who said: ‘I am taking action with Just Stop Oil because I am absolutely terrified for my future. I don’t want to be disrupting people’s evenings out, but I have been left with no other choice.</p>
