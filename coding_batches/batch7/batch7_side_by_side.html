What they make of my support is up to them.<br><br>&#x27;I probably don&#x27;t support them in the way that they want.&#x27;<br><br>The prosecutor asked about a Just Stop Oil press release relating to the Channel 4 documentary Is It Time To Break the Law?, which Mr Packham presented.<br><br>He insisted the press release had been &#x27;inaccurate&#x27;, that he had not advocated breaking the law and the programme would not have aired under broadcasting rules if he had called for law-breaking.<br><br>The defendant, who represented herself, asked Mr Packham in her cross-examination: &#x27;What were you feeling (when you were stuck)?&#x27;<br><br>He replied: &#x27;Knowing I was going to be late initially was causing me some concern.</p>

    <p>&#x27;I don&#x27;t like to fail the teams that I work with, even simply by being late.<br><br>&#x27;Initially I felt very frustrated and then obviously I researched, on trying to navigate a quicker route, I discovered the reason was that protesters were active on the M25, and then I changed my thinking.<br><br>&#x27;(I thought) I might as well use this to reflect again on why I am being delayed. That is what I chose to do.<br><br>&#x27;I sat and contemplated the reason that might have motivated the protesters to take that action.<br><br>&#x27;I thought about whether that action was productive and what it was doing. I took it as an opportunity to reflect on the fact I was in a traffic system sufficiently fragile, even normal disturbance would cause significant delay.<br><br>&#x27;I reflected on the fact that I was sweating quite profusely, it was a day after the UK had recorded its highest ever temperature and two days previously the Government&#x27;s net zero plan had been declared illegal.<br><br>&#x27;I understood, I think, why protesters were taking their action.<br><br>&#x27;This led me to sympathise with the fact that I needed to be put in a position where I was forced to think about the gravity of the situation.<br><br>&#x27;Rather than sit and fret and sweat, I thought I would run through a process that would make the experience positive.&#x27;<br><br>Earlier on Wednesday, the defendant broke down in tears at points during cross-examination as she insisted she faced a &#x27;massive moral dilemma&#x27; by engaging in the protest.<br><br>The defendant, who has taken two years out of her studies, told the court she did not believe all lanes would end up closed and that she did not realise she was so close to Heathrow during the protest.<br><br>When asked whether she intended to cause &#x27;spectacular disruption&#x27;, she told the court she did not but soon &#x27;realised this was potentially a more effective protest than I thought it would be&#x27;.<br><br>She does not dispute scaling the gantry but denies that it amounts to the charge against her.<br><br>The trial continues.</p>

    <p>Protestors stormed the 18th green during the final round of the Travelers Championship Sunday afternoon.<br><br>As Tom Kim stood on the final green with a chance to force a playoff against World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, with the pair poised to take their final putts on the 18th, the gripping finale of the PGA Tour&#x27;s final non-cut signature event took another twist.<br><br>A group of climate change protesters representing &#x27;Extinction Rebellion&#x27; slipped under the ropes, bypassed Cromwell police and stormed the putting surface in astonishing scenes.<br><br>The fairway invaders, who appeared to be wearing climate change messages on their t-shirts, tossed red, white and yellow powder at the golf course, with one even trampling through a greenside bunker.<br><br>The group of at least five were swiftly arrested by law enforcement on site and carted away. However, the destruction they left in their wake delayed the thrilling end to the tournament.<br><br>Tour officials were called to the green where groundskeepers waited with leaf blowers ready to be called into action.<br><br>Some of the intruders wore t-shirts with the message &#x27;No Golf On A Dead Planet&#x27; emblazoned across the front.<br><br>Police handcuffed at least five people, according to CBS play-by-play man Jim Nantz.<br><br>After they were escorted off the course, Scheffler left a potential 26-foot clincher from the fringe on the right edge of the cup, then tapped in for par.<br><br>If the delay heightened Kim&#x27;s nerves at all he didn&#x27;t show it. Following the greenside drama, the 22-year-old calmly stepped up and sank his birdie putt to tie the world&#x27;s top-ranked golfer and force a play off.<br><br>&#x27;It kind of took like the meaning of the putt kind of a way for a second,&#x27; Kim later told the media. &#x27;Because for the past 17 and a half holes all you&#x27;re thinking about is golf, and suddenly when that happens you&#x27;re almost not even playing golf anymore.<br><br>&#x27;I thought it was a dream for a second. The security guards were tackling people and people were getting arrested, it&#x27;s really hard to see nowadays.<br><br>&#x27;It took my mind off of the moment and [I] just kind of realized what was happening and obviously even though those people did something bad, you still don&#x27;t want them to get hurt. Obviously the police are trying to protect the players, I get it, but you still don&#x27;t want people to get hurt and I think it just kind of personally just took my mind away from golf a little bit and worried about something else.&#x27;<br><br>Scheffler eventually held his nerve in the playoff to prevail on a dramatic day over in Connecticut, marking his sixth win on the PGA Tour this year.</p>

    <p>He came out on top for the second time in three weeks, capturing the Memorial Tournament prior to last week&#x27;s struggles at the US Open.<br><br>&#x27;It was definitely a bit weird,&#x27; Scheffler said of the incident after hoisting the trophy. &#x27;I saw one person out of the corner of my eye, and then I saw about five police officers sprinting around. From my point of view, they got it taken care of pretty dang fast, and so we were very grateful for that.<br><br>&#x27;When something like that happens, you don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s happening, so it can kind of rattle you a little bit, just because there&#x27;s people running around the green and there&#x27;s police officers running around the green and you don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re peaceful, you don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, you have no idea what&#x27;s going on, so it can be a bit stressful.&#x27;<br><br>Scheffler shot 5-under 65 in the final round, but Kim&#x27;s 66 with a 10-foot birdie putt on the last hole forced the extra golf. On the last hole of regulation, Scheffler left his approach on the left fringe and two-putted from there.<br><br>Kim&#x27;s approach shot was within a couple of inches of the hole before rolling back before he converted the must-make putt to extend the tournament.<br><br>The duo played No. 18 again in the playoff, with Kim&#x27;s approach short and in a bunker. After blasting out, he couldn&#x27;t roll in a long par putt.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion released a statement shortly after Sunday&#x27;s protests at the Travelers Championship, insisting they were aiming to highlight the &#x27;worldwide danger of climate breakdown&#x27;.<br><br>They also pointed to Saturday&#x27;s events in Cromwell, where spectators at the tournament were struck by lightning amid a thunderstorm in the area.<br><br>&#x27;With this action, Extinction Rebellion is NOT protesting any individual or organization,&#x27; the statement reads. &#x27;Rather, the protest highlights the worldwide danger of climate breakdown.<br><br>&#x27;Case in point: the last 13 months were the hottest on record, with extreme weather events around the globe. The activists pointed out that natural disasters are already causing large-scale loss of human, animal, and plant life, as well as significant damage to infrastructure, property, and agriculture.<br><br>&#x27;Just yesterday, they noted, at least two fans were injured due to a lightning strike at the Travelers Championship. This was of course due to increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather conditions.&#x27;</p>

    <p>Scotland Yard said 630 arrests had been made of Just Stop Oil protesters since 30 October, and 328 people went on to be charged. The rest have been released on police bail.<br><br>JSO data shows at least 276 people have been charged: at least 125 were charged with blocking key national infrastructure under section 7 and 125 with the lesser offence of wilful obstruction of the highway.<br><br>Sign up to Down to Earth<br><br>The planet&#x27;s most important stories. Get all the week&#x27;s environment news - the good, the bad and the essential<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>Just Stop Oil said: “They’re imprisoning peaceful protesters, protecting the real criminals, and licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects while everything burns.”<br><br>The widespread use of section 7 appears to have taken its toll on Just Stop Oil’s latest campaign of protest. On Wednesday, just half a dozen people turned up at Trafalgar Square, with only three wearing orange bibs with the group’s insignia. A couple of police officers hovered nearby.<br><br>Asked why they thought so few had come, one demonstrator said: “Everyone’s been arrested, everyone’s got court.”<br><br>Rachel Payne, 73, said she had already been jailed for her part in Just Stop Oil’s campaign during last year’s Cop27 climate talks.<br><br>She said the law had narrowed down what they were able to do as protest. “Last week, I saw them [protesters] get to the top of Whitehall and as soon as they put their feet on the road swarms of police just arrested them – two days running.<br><br>“In this country it’s supposed to be a free country. [Facilitating] protest is supposed to be a duty of the police – to enable protest – and yet they [the protesters] were not even allowed to be there.”<br><br>A university lecturer who knows one of those arrested said he believed the use of section 7 for walking down a road was disproportionate for such a peaceful protest.<br><br>Graham Mann, a lecturer in atmospheric science at Leeds University, said: “My perspective from being a PhD student in the 90s and the urgency of the climate emergency then, the science is very, very clear and has been for a long time. The urgency to decarbonise to reduce emissions has become even greater. So I can understand young people taking these actions.”<br><br>A spokesperson for Climate Action Support Pathway, which provides advice to those considering taking action, said: “This was the first real test for these new section 7 powers, and it became quickly clear that the police were going to use them readily. We changed the emphasis of our advice to those considering taking part as a result because section 7 carries a higher maximum penalty of a year in prison, and people need to be making informed choices about whether they want to take action or not.”<br><br>Asked about the 19-year-old student held in a London prison, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We are looking into this matter.”<br><br>Scotland Yard said: “All of the decisions on whether to charge, bail or NFA [no further action] Just Stop Oil activists have all been made within the 24 hours. We are working with magistrates courts across London, and in some cases in other counties, to put the activists who have been charged before magistrates at the earliest opportunity. However, there is only a limited number of people who can be seen by magistrates each day so it is not always possible for them to appear on the day they are charged.”</p></td>

Our activists were facing a combined total of up to 15 years in prison for standing up to one of the world’s largest plastic polluters.<br><br>“The invented crime of ‘locking on’ is just one new tool in a well-stocked legal arsenal that is being used to stifle dissent and send peaceful protesters to jail.

    <p>“It is unhinged, psychopathic greed at the expense of billions of people.”<br><br>The group says it is calling for financial institutions to stop all finance and insurance for fossil fuel expansion immediately; adopt 1.5C-aligned emissions-reduction targets for oil, gas, and coal; demand robust 1.5C-aligned transition plans for all existing fossil fuel clients; protect Indigenous peoples’ and human rights; and scale up financing for a just and fair transition. If the financial sector ignores their demands, then by October they will escalate further, the group said.<br><br>JP Morgan and Barclays were contacted for comment. A spokesperson for Allianz said there was no disruption or impact on its business operations.<br><br>Shut the System previously targeted insurance companies in the City in January, sabotaging fibre optic cables in an action that one cybersecurity expert said caused a “significant slowdown of internet speed” in the district.<br><br>Its clandestine tactics are a departure from those of Extinction Rebellion and its successors Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil, for whom accountability for their actions was a key part of their modus operandi.<br><br>A number of supporters of Just Stop Oil have received lengthy sentences after a crackdown on environmental activism that has included a number of draconian new laws passed and stiffer sentences handed down to direct action protesters.<br><br>Shut the System’s spokesperson said: “We have been forced underground by draconian anti-protest laws. The British state has recently shown how much they are willing to suppress peaceful protest.<br><br>“History shows direct action and sabotage are highly effective so we cannot stop while the climate emergency wages on and we see the most hopeful path forward is to operate beyond the state’s reach.”</p></td>
