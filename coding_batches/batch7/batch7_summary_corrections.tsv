The-Times_2023-11-27_Climate-activists-glue-50	The original article ends with three sentences of a statement by Barclays bank defending themselves from the protesters' accusations. None of this material is included in the summary, which means that the overall balance has shifted from the original to be more sympathetic to the protesters in the summary. This must be fixed by including at least some summarised material from the Barclays statement.
The-Times_2024-07-27_Mum-got-four-years	The summary alters the tone and balance of the original article. The original article presents a sympathetic, humanizing portrait of Louise Lancaster through extensive quotes from her family members who describe her as "unrelentingly kind," and as someone who "listens more than she speaks" and who struggled with the decision to inconvenience people. The family's perspective dominates the original, explaining her careful reasoning process, her previous attempts at conventional activism, and the personal costs she has endured. In contrast, the summary strips away almost all of this humanizing context and family perspective, instead leading with and emphasizing the judge's characterization of Lancaster and others as having "crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic." The summary focuses primarily on the disruption caused and the legal proceedings, while relegating the family's supportive view to just a brief mention in the subtitle. The key aspects of the protest itself must be covered, but not at the expense of losing changing the article's tone which is sympathetic, family-focused, and includes the personal story of why Lancaster felt compelled to act.
