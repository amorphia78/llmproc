The article states in the headline and early text that Cressida Gethin is 21, but later refers to her as "The 22-year-old activist." Additionally, there is a spelling inconsistency with the defendant's surname - she is referred to as both "Gethin" in the headline and early text, and "Gething" in one of the image captions.

This creates confusion about which golfer is actually shown in the image and contradicts the earlier statement about Tom Kim being the one positioned to take the crucial putt.
