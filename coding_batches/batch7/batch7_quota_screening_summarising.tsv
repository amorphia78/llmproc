The original article maintains journalistic balance by including substantial content from Barclays' response, which takes up a significant portion of the article and presents the bank's position on their climate commitments, including their net zero ambition by 2050, their 32% reduction in energy sector emissions since 2020, and their $99 billion in green finance since 2018. The summary completely removes Barclays' response, creating an unbalanced presentation that is heavily weighted toward the protesters' perspective without the counterbalancing corporate response that was prominent in the original. This changes the overall tone from a balanced news report to one that appears more sympathetic to the protesters' position by omitting the bank's defense of their actions.	The original article ends with three sentences of a statement by Barclays bank defending themselves from the protesters' accusations. None of this material is included in the summary, which means that the overall balance has shifted from the original to be more sympathetic to the protesters in the summary. This must be fixed by including at least some summarised material from the Barclays statement.
