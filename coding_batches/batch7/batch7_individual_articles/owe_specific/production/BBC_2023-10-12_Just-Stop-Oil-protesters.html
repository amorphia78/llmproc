    <p>Two Just Stop Oil protesters who scaled the Dartford Crossing bridge have been refused permission to challenge their jail sentences at the Supreme Court.<br><br>Morgan Trowland, 40, was jailed for three years and Marcus Decker, 34, for two years for causing a public nuisance. The pair caused gridlock traffic after they scaled the bridge for almost 40 hours last October.<br><br>A hearing in London decided their jail terms were &quot;not excessive&quot;. Protesters appealed against the longevity of the sentences in July, but judges refused to grant permission for the two men to take their case to the UK&#x27;s highest court.<br><br>In their July ruling, the judges acknowledged the &quot;long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience on conscientious grounds&quot; and that the sentences handed to Trowland and Decker went &quot;well beyond previous sentences imposed for this type of offending&quot;.<br><br>But at a hearing on Thursday, Lady Chief Justice Lady Carr said the jail terms were &quot;not excessive&quot; and the sentences met a &quot;legitimate&quot; aim of deterring others from such offending. Lady Carr added: &quot;The sentences should not be seen as having a &#x27;chilling effect&#x27; on the right to peaceful protest or to assembly more generally - deterrence and &#x27;chilling effect&#x27; are not the same.&quot;</p>

    <p>However, Daniel Friedman KC, representing the activists, had previously argued their jail terms were &quot;the longest ever handed down in a case of non-violent protest in this country in modern times&quot;.<br><br>Structural engineer Trowland, of Islington, north London, and private tutor Decker, of no fixed address, denied causing a public nuisance, arguing it was a protest. The trial heard the protesters ascended to a point close to 200ft above the road and unfurled a &quot;giant Just Stop Oil banner&quot; and &quot;rigged up hammocks&quot;.<br><br>Essex Police said those affected by the disruption included a &quot;heavily pregnant woman who needed urgent medical help&quot;. Another person missed the funeral of their best friend of 35 years, and a business lost more than £160,000 in earnings.</p>
