    <p>Speaking to the camera, she then said: &#x27;So apparently this is the world we live in now. Getting arrested, literally for just posting a letter through to somebody&#x27;s house...somebody&#x27;s front door. That&#x27;s so far from a crime, isn&#x27;t it?&#x27;<br><br>To which the police officer replied: &#x27;You&#x27;ve got these bail conditions for a reason, haven&#x27;t you.&#x27;<br><br>She responded: &#x27;To prevent that. This is what it was trying to prevent. Just delivering a letter.&#x27;<br><br>The video cuts to footage of a police van arriving, and Plummer climbs in before turning and waving, saying: &#x27;See you guys later!&#x27; and laughs.<br><br>Pink-haired Plummer grew up in privilege, raised in a £4million family home near the King&#x27;s Road in Chelsea and privately educated at £45,000-a year St Mary&#x27;s School in Ascot, Berkshire, then £34,000-a-year Mander Portman Woodward College in Kensington, west London.</p>
