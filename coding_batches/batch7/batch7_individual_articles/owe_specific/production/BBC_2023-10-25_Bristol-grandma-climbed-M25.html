She told the judge she had joined the protest after Just Stop Oil called for volunteers.<br><br>&quot;I heard a Just Stop Oil Zoom call for climbers to volunteer,&quot; Ms Delap said. &quot;I thought, well, I am 76, I have never had any climbing experience, I didn&#x27;t think I had to volunteer for that.
