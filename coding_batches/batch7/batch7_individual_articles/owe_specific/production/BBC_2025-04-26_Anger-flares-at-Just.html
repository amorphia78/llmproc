    <p>In its March statement announcing the end of direct action, the group said: &quot;Just Stop Oil&#x27;s initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history.<br><br>&quot;We&#x27;ve kept over 4.4 billion barrels of oil in the ground and the courts have ruled new oil and gas licences unlawful.&quot;<br><br>The Labour government has said it will not issue licences for new oil and gas exploration, while a series of recent court cases have halted fossil fuel projects including oil drilling in Surrey, a coal mine in Cumbria and the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields in the North Sea over climate pollution.<br><br>Labour has distanced itself from Just Stop Oil, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer criticising its actions and saying protesters must face the full force of the law.<br><br>The Metropolitan Police have been approached for comment.</p>
