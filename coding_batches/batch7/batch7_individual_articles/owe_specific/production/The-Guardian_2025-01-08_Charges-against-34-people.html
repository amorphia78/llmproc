Activists also blocked the entrances to the building, locking themselves on to large models of the company&#x27;s flagship Dove products and a &quot;dead dove&quot; parody of the brand&#x27;s logo.<br><br>The first trials had been due to begin on 15 January at City of London magistrates court.<br><br>Unilever has been approached for a comment.</p></body></html>
