Just Stop Oil described it as a “major test case” of the new law.<br><br>Critics have said section 7 makes anyone walking in a road liable for prosecution for “interference with key national infrastructure”, giving police undue discretion over when to target protesters.<br><br>It bans any act that prevents newspaper printing presses, power plants, oil and gas extraction or distribution sites, harbours, airports, railways or roads “from being used or operated to any extent”, with a potential penalty of 12 months in jail.</p>

    <p>According to Just Stop Oil, Plummer, Sarti and Hall marched for less than 20 minutes along Cromwell Road, which leads from Kensington to Earl’s Court, blocking traffic as part of a campaign calling on the government to halt all new licences for oil, gas and coal exploitation.<br><br>After their arrests, Plummer was held on remand for 18 days and Sarti for 19 days.<br><br>Before the start of the trial, Plummer, 22, said: “I can’t really believe this trial is even happening. I was on a march for less than 20 minutes, which I have already spent two and a half weeks in prison for, and now over a week of judges, lawyers and a jury’s time has to be wasted to decide if that’s a crime.”</p></body></html>
