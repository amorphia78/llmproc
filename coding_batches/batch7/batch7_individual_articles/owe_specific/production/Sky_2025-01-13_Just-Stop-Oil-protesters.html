    <p>Just Stop Oil (JSO) protesters have spray-painted Charles Darwin&#x27;s grave in Westminster Abbey to highlight rising global temperatures, the climate protest group has said.<br><br>The slogan &quot;1.5 is dead&quot; was sprayed in chalk paint on the gravestone of the 19th-century naturalist - widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology - at about 9.30am on Monday.<br><br>The figure refers to the goal, set by the Paris Climate Agreement, of making sure global temperatures rise to no more than 1.5C higher than their pre-industrial level. Last year was the first time global temperatures passed the threshold of 1.5C above their pre-industrial level. Staying below that mark was one of the key commitments of the global Paris Climate Treaty which countries agreed to in 2015, in a bid to avert the most dangerous impacts of climate change.<br><br>JSO said Alyson Lee, 66, a retired teaching assistant from Derby, and Di Bligh, a 77-year-old former chief executive of Reading Council, from Rode, were involved in the protest.<br><br>The Metropolitan Police confirmed two women were arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage &quot;with what is believed to be powdered paint at Westminster Abbey&quot;. Officers led two women away from the abbey after the protest.</p>

    <p>Ms Lee said ministers are &quot;are not doing enough [on climate change].&quot; Ms Bligh told the Press Association they had done it &quot;because there&#x27;s no hope for the world, really&quot; and said they chose Darwin&#x27;s grave because, as a &quot;good scientist&quot;, he would support their aims and &quot;would be as upset as us with the government for ignoring the science&quot;.<br><br>According to JSO, the two supporters were heard saying: &quot;2024 was the hottest year on record. We have passed the 1.5 degree threshold that was supposed to keep us safe. The government&#x27;s plans will take us to over three degrees of warming. World leaders must stop burning oil, gas and coal by 2030.&quot;<br><br>A spokesperson for the church confirmed orange paint had been sprayed onto the gravestone, but they do not think there will be any permanent damage.</p>
