        <h1>Anti-whaling activist Paul Watson kept in Greenland jail</h1><p>A court in Greenland has ruled that anti-whaling activist Paul Watson must remain in custody pending a decision to extradite him to Japan.<br><br>The veteran campaigner, who has featured in the reality television show &quot;Whale Wars&quot;, was apprehended by police in July as his ship docked in Greenland&#x27;s capital, Nuuk. They were acting on a 2012 Japanese warrant which accuses him of causing damage to a Japanese whaling ship, obstructing business and injuring a crew member during an encounter in Antarctic waters in February 2010.<br><br>Dressed in jeans and a white shirt, Mr Watson sat beside his defence lawyers and listened to proceedings through an interpreter as several of his supporters looked on. &quot;This is about revenge for a television show that extremely embarrassed Japan in the eyes of the world,&quot; he told the small courtroom. &quot;What happened in the Southern Ocean is documented by hundreds of hours of video,&quot; Mr Watson said. &quot;I think a review of all the video and of all the documentation will exonerate me from the accusations.&quot;</p>

    <p>However the prosecution argued that the defendant was a flight risk, and the judge concluded he should remain in custody until 2 October.<br><br>Paul Watson is the former head of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which he left in 2022 to set up the Captain Paul Watson Foundation. He was also a founding member of Greenpeace, but they parted ways in 1977, amid disagreements over his radical tactics. The 73-year old Canadian-American campaigner has been a controversial figure known for confrontations with whaling vessels at sea.<br><br>At the defence&#x27;s request, the judge granted permission for a video clip to be played, which appeared to show a zodiac-type speedboat sailing alongside a Japanese ship and firing a stink bomb. However, Mr Watson&#x27;s lawyers say a second video clip proves no-one was on deck at the time.</p></body></html>
