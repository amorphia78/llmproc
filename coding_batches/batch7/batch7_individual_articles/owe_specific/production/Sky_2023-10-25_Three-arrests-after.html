    <p>Three people have been arrested after orange paint was sprayed on Wellington Arch in London by Just Stop Oil protesters.<br><br>Smoke flares were also set off alongside the Grade I-listed monument, which is nearly 200 years old.<br><br>Campaigners used fire extinguishers to spray the paint as part of the protest against new fossil fuel licences.<br><br>According to the Just Stop Oil website, one of those taking action at the monument was Joshua Lane, 26, an engineer from Sheffield, who said: &quot;I am compelled to take action due to the severity, and sheer emergency we find ourselves in today.<br><br>&quot;Future generations live in uncertainty, and we are given false promises time after time by endless pantomime governments.&quot;<br><br>Another of the activists, Joe Hogan, 40, from Hertfordshire, said: &quot;Traditional, managed, sanitised forms of protest have done nothing.</p>

    <p>&quot;The only way forward is through sustained, disruptive civil resistance.&quot;<br><br>The protest comes just weeks after the government backed the development of the UK&#x27;s largest untapped oil and gas field at Rosebank, 80 miles west of Shetland.<br><br>It came despite warnings about the climate damage of new fossil fuel projects and with analysis showing the project is likely to have little positive impact on the British economy.<br><br>The Met Police confirmed it was made aware of the protest just before 10.20am on Wednesday and three people were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.</p></body></html>
