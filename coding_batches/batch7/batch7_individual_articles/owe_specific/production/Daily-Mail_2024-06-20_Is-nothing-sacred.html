    <p>Eco-fanatics caused outrage yesterday by defacing Stonehenge on the eve of the summer solstice.<br><br>Just Stop Oil activists used fire extinguishers to spray orange powder paint on at least three of the ancient stones before calmly sitting down cross-legged in front of the world-famous site.<br><br>Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer showed a rare united front in their condemnation of the stunt. The Prime Minister described it as a &#x27;disgraceful act of vandalism&#x27;, while the Labour leader branded the group &#x27;pathetic&#x27;.<br><br>Footage of the shocking incident at noon yesterday shows horrified onlookers shouting &#x27;no&#x27; while trying to drag the vandals away from the 5,000-year-old site.<br><br>Police arrested two protesters – named by the group as Rajan Naidu, 73, from Birmingham, and Oxford student Niamh Lynch, 21 – on &#x27;suspicion of damaging the ancient monument&#x27;.<br><br>Lynch said in a statement: &#x27;Stonehenge at solstice is all about celebrating the natural world – but look at the state it&#x27;s in! Standing inert for generations works well for stones – not climate policy.&#x27;</p>

    <p>Naidu, who is understood to be a Quaker, added: &#x27;Either we end the fossil-fuel era, or the fossil-fuel era will end us.&#x27;<br><br>Conservative minister Simon Hoare joined the chorus of criticism. &#x27;The full weight of the law is needed. I would incarcerate them on an old oil rig.&#x27;<br><br>Fellow Tory Alex Stafford said: &#x27;It&#x27;s absolutely disgusting – these mindless vandals have no appreciation for our history and heritage. All they can do is destroy rather than create.&#x27;<br><br>Nick Kendrick, 55, who has been a Stonehenge tour guide for more than 30 years, said: &#x27;There are 79 different species of lichen which grow on those rocks. These lichen are alive and help protect the stone and (they) will definitely have been harmed by this idiotic stunt.&#x27;<br><br>Just Stop Oil said: &#x27;Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything.&#x27;</p>
