    <p>Around 140 flights at Germany&#x27;s busiest airport have been cancelled after climate protesters glued themselves to the tarmac.<br><br>Activist group Last Generation said six protesters headed towards the runway at Frankfurt Airport wearing fluorescent orange vests and carrying signs that read &quot;Oil kills&quot;, after cutting a hole in the perimeter fence.<br><br>Their presence triggered a response from police, firefighters and airport security officers, apparently resulting in arrests. Eight people are currently in police custody, according to Last Generation.<br><br>All runways were operational again by 7.50am local time (6.50am UK time) but the airport warned passengers that further delays and cancellations are expected later today.<br><br>The airport said it &quot;sharply condemns&quot; the protest and &quot;reserves the right to take legal action&quot; adding that the protesters&#x27; actions &quot;pose severe danger... putting human life at risk&quot;.</p>

    <p>The protest is part of environmental activist groups&#x27; plans to target airports around Europe this summer, demanding that governments around the world end the extraction and burning of fossil fuels by 2030.<br><br>The protest in Germany coincides with the government&#x27;s decision last week to approve new legislation, which would see tougher penalties imposed on airport trespassers.<br><br>Though the bill is still awaiting approval, if implemented, it could see punishments such as a two-year prison sentence for those who intentionally intrude into airside areas.<br><br>Germany&#x27;s home secretary Nancy Faeser, who has pushed for the new legislation, called Thursday&#x27;s protest &quot;dangerous, dumb and criminal&quot;, and said acts like it should be &quot;punished more severely&quot;.<br><br>Currently, intruders who access airside areas are only fined, though a prison sentence of up to five years is possible in some cases.</p>
