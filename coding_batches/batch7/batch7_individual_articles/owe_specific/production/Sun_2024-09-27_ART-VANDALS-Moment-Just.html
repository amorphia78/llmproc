    <p>The frame was purchased by the gallery in 1999, the court heard, and was valued at £28,000.<br><br>Sentencing the women, Judge Christopher Hehir said the &quot;cultural treasure&quot; could have been &quot;seriously damaged or even destroyed&quot;.<br><br>Judge Hehir continued: &quot;Soup might have seeped through the glass. You couldn&#x27;t have cared less if the painting was damaged or not. You had no right to do what you did to Sunflowers.&quot;<br><br>The judge told Plummer: &quot;You clearly think your beliefs give you the right to commit crimes when you feel like it. You do not.&quot;<br><br>Judge Hehir said they &quot;came within the width of a pane of glass of destroying one of the most valuable artworks in the world&quot;.<br><br>Painted in Arles in the south of France in August 1888, van Gogh&#x27;s painting shows 15 sunflowers standing in a yellow pot against a yellow background.</p>
