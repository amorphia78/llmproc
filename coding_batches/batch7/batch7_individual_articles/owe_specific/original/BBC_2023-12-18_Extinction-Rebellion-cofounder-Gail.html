    <p>The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion has received a 15-month suspended jail sentence after a marathon legal battle over her breaking a pane of glass.<br><br>Dr Gail Bradbrook was convicted last month of causing more than £27,500 of damage to the Department for Transport.<br><br>At Isleworth Crown Court, Judge Martin Edmunds KC said Bradbrook had a conscientious motive but that did not excuse her actions.<br><br>During the sentencing hearing, she accused judges of &quot;mansplaining&quot;.<br><br>Bradbrook, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, was joined by a group of supporters dressed as suffragettes. In court, there was applause as the Extinction Rebellion (XR) activist finished her address to Judge Edmunds.<br><br>In October 2019, during XR&#x27;s second major protest that brought traffic chaos to parts of central London, Bradbrook climbed on to an entrance canopy at the headquarters of the Department for Transport (DfT).<br><br>She used tools to break a large pane of reinforced security glass, which cost £27,660 to replace.<br><br>During her police interview, she said she had been trying to stop crimes against humanity and &quot;had permission from nature&quot; to break the window.<br><br>Over two trials she tried to make similar arguments despite being repeatedly directed not to do so by the judge because none of them amounted to a defence that a jury could consider.<br><br>On Monday, Bradbrook told Judge Edmunds: &quot;It can&#x27;t be that there&#x27;s compelling, objective evidence of a threat to life, and that&#x27;s just completely irrelevant to the whole legal process.<br><br>&quot;I know that is not what justice seeks to serve.&quot;<br><br>Bradbrook&#x27;s case is one of scores linked to environmental protests since 2018 in which activists said damage, or serious disruption, caused as part of civil disobedience was legally justified.<br><br>She accused the courts in these cases of &quot;condescension&quot; and treating activists &quot;as if we were acting in good faith but slightly deranged&quot;.</p>

    <p>&quot;I&#x27;ve had to listen to judges incorrectly characterising and, worse still, mansplaining the effectiveness of civil disobedience,&quot; she said.<br><br>Becoming tearful, she concluded: &quot;God help us... life is being actively killed. We are compelled to act. The court systems of the UK are on trial, not myself.<br><br>&quot;I wonder how history will judge this sentencing.&quot;<br><br>Judge Edmunds said Bradbrook had &quot;actively sought&quot; prosecution to attract publicity, and had wrongly tried to tell the jury that her actions had been legally necessary.<br><br>&quot;As a matter of law, that was certainly incorrect for damage on this scale,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;I put it down to an echo chamber of misinformation and wishful thinking. In many pre-trial hearings you accepted that the law did not provide you with a defence. Yet throughout, you have sought to avoid those penalties [for damaging the window] rather than accept them.&quot;<br><br>Earlier this year the Court of Appeal ruled that judges hearing environmental protest cases should not evaluate the merits of the cause.<br><br>If a protester had been motivated by conscience, and the damage or disruption caused had not been excessive, judges were told to consider reducing the sentence.<br><br>Judge Edmunds said that the damage and disruption caused by Bradbrook meant she would have normally have been jailed.<br><br>But taking into account the Court of Appeal ruling and wider personal factors he suspended Bradbrook&#x27;s prison sentence, meaning she could leave court a free woman - but could be jailed if she commits another crime in the next 15 months.<br><br>She was also ordered to also carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.<br><br>Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.
