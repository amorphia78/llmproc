However, it has been heavily criticised by conservation groups.<br><br>Dressed in jeans and a white shirt, Mr Watson sat beside his defence lawyers and listened to proceedings through an interpreter as several of his supporters looked on.<br><br>“This is about revenge for a television show that extremely embarrassed Japan in the eyes of the world,” he told the small courtroom.<br><br>“What happened in the Southern Ocean is documented by hundreds of hours of video,” Mr Watson said.<br><br>“I think a review of all the video and of all the documentation will exonerate me from the accusations.”<br><br>However the prosecution argued that the defendant was a flight risk, and the judge concluded he should remain in custody until 2 October.<br><br>Paul Watson is the former head of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which he left in 2022 to set up the Captain Paul Watson Foundation.<br><br>He was also a founding member of Greenpeace, but they parted ways in 1977, amid disagreements over his radical tactics.<br><br>The 73-year old Canadian-American campaigner has been a controversial figure known for confrontations with whaling vessels at sea.<br><br>Mr Watson’s vessel, called the M/Y John Paul DeJoria, had been heading to the North Pacific with a crew of 26 volunteers on board, in a bid to intercept a new Japanese whaling ship when it docked to refuel in Nuuk on 21 July.<br><br>He was arrested and led away in handcuffs, and has been held at the local prison for the last seven weeks.<br><br>His defence team have appealed against the decision to keep him in custody before Greenland’s High Court.<br><br>Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark and, although the court in Nuuk is overseeing the custody hearings, the decision about Mr Watson’s extradition lies with Danish authorities in Copenhagen.</p>

    <p>Last month, Japan asked Denmark to hand Paul Watson over, even though there is no extradition treaty between the two countries.<br><br>Police in Nuuk are carrying out an investigation before handing their findings to Denmark’s ministry of justice and a decision could be expected within the next few weeks.<br><br>“It’s a serious case, and it has to have some serious consideration. It has a deep impact on Mr Watson if we get to the point that he has to be extradited. So I will take the time needed to do it properly,” Greenland chief prosecutor Mariam Khalil told the BBC.<br><br>At the defence’s request, the judge granted permission for a video clip to be played, which appeared to show a zodiac-type speedboat sailing alongside a Japanese ship and firing a stink bomb.<br><br>However, Mr Watson&#x27;s lawyers say a second video clip, which was not shown, proves no-one was on deck at the time.<br><br>“We have video footage of a stink bomb being shot on to the ship, and the position that the Japanese claim the sailor should be in, he simply isn&#x27;t there,” Jonas Christoffersen told BBC.<br><br>“There’s no evidential basis for the allegation that somebody got injured.”<br><br>Lyon-based international police body Interpol has confirmed the existence of an outstanding red notice for the arrest of Mr Watson.<br><br>In 2012, Paul Watson was also detained in Germany, but left the country after learning that he was sought for extradition by Japan.<br><br>Masashi Mizobuchi, assistant press secretary for the Japanese ministry of foreign affairs, told the BBC that Japan had not yet received any response from the Danish authorities.<br><br>“We will continue to take appropriate measures, including necessary outreach to the relevant countries and organisations,” Mr Mizobuchi said.<br><br>Japan withdrew from the International Whaling Commission and resumed commercial whaling in 2019, after a 30-year hiatus. However, it had continued whaling for what it said were research purposes.<br><br>French President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s office has asked Denmark not to extradite Paul Watson, and there has been vocal support from legendary actress turned animals rights activist Brigitte Bardot.<br><br>Meanwhile a petition calling for Mr Watson’s release has surpassed 120,000 signatures.</p></body></html>
