        <h1>Greta Thunberg was given ‘final warning’ before London arrest</h1><h2>Activist says ‘history’s judgment will not be gentle’ for those behind climate crisis after day in court on public order charges</h2><p>Greta Thunberg was given a “final warning” before her arrest in London during a climate demonstration last year, a court has heard.<br><br>The 21-year-old from Sweden was arrested near the InterContinental Hotel in Mayfair on Oct 17 last year as oil executives met inside for the Energy Intelligence Forum.<br><br>Thunberg, two Fossil Free London protesters and two Greenpeace activists appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday for their trial after each pleading not guilty in November to breaching Section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986.<br><br>The court heard that protesters started to gather near the hotel at around 7.30am and police engaged with them about improving access for members of the public, which had been made “impossible”.<br><br>Prosecutor Luke Staton said a couple of protesters gained access to the roof just before 10.30am and “were slowly abseiling down the side of the building”.<br><br>The Section 14 condition was imposed at around 12.30pm, which dictated that the protest could continue but on the pavement to the south of the hotel, the court heard.<br><br>Thunberg was standing outside the hotel entrance and was approached by police, informed of the condition and of the designated protest area, the court heard.<br><br>Mr Staton told the court that she was warned by one officer that her failure to comply would result in her arrest.<br><br>While that officer was elsewhere engaged, another officer then spoke with Thunberg and “gave her a final warning”, the prosecutor said.<br><br>“She said that she was staying where she was and so she was arrested,” Mr Staton said.<br><br>The other defendants were similarly informed of the Section 14 condition and did not move to the designated protest area, the court heard.</p>

    <p>Mr Staton said: “The Crown’s case is that all five of these defendants took part in a public assembly.<br><br>“They knew or ought to have known that a Section 14 condition had been imposed and they all failed to comply with that condition.”<br><br>Thunberg made notes sporadically during the proceedings.<br><br>She arrived at the court just after 9am and made her way past media and environmental protesters who were demonstrating “in solidarity” with the defendants, holding up large yellow banners that read “Climate protest is not a crime” and cardboard signs saying: “Who are the real criminals?”<br><br>Wearing a grey jacket, Thunberg smiled at photographers before making her way inside.<br><br>Outside court after the proceedings were adjourned for the day, Thunberg made a statement alongside some of her co-defendants in which she said: “Even though we are the ones standing here, climate, environmental and human rights activists all over the world are being prosecuted, sometimes convicted, and given ... penalties for acting in line with science.<br><br>“We must remember who the real enemy is. What are we defending? Who are our laws meant to protect?”<br><br>She added: “History’s judgment against those who deliberately destroy and sacrifice ... resources at the expense of humanity, at the expense of all those who are suffering the consequences of the environmental and climate crisis ... and at the expense of future generations, your own children and grandchildren will not be gentle.”<br><br>The trial continues on Friday.</p></body></html>
