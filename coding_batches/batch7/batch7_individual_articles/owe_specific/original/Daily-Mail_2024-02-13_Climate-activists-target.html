    <p>Climate activists have targeted Botticelli&#x27;s famed Birth of Venus painting as they stuck pictures of flooded towns on the glass protector at the Uffizi museum in Florence.<br><br>Two activists from Last Generation posted images of a flooded Tuscan town over the goddess&#x27; giant shell on the 15th-century art work, before being escorted to a police station, the campaign group said in a statement.<br><br>&#x27;The government continues to pretend that fields did not burn in January, that water will not be a problem this summer, that houses destroyed by floods are accidental events and not caused by human choices,&#x27; one of the protesters, Giordano, was quoted as saying.<br><br>&#x27;And instead of dealing with these real problems, it makes absurd laws&#x27; punishing climate activism, he said.<br><br>Italy&#x27;s parliament in January approved a law increasing penalties for people who damage monuments and cultural sites, following a series of climate protests.<br><br>&#x27;We ask the government to take concrete action to support communities affected by climate disasters. They can censor us, but they cannot censor reality,&#x27; the Italian branch of Last Generation wrote on X.<br><br>On a fundraising page to cover &#x27;legal fees, travel and accommodation costs&#x27; for their activists, Last Generation reacted to the new law by writing: &#x27;Despite the &quot;ecoprotest&quot; law, despite precautionary measures, despite increasingly grotesque oppression, we do not stop and continue to take actions.<br><br>&#x27;We continue because there is no justice for the victims of landslides and floods [...].<br><br>&#x27;We demand that the government takes responsibility for caring for the victims of these disasters [in Campi Bisenzio and Emilia-Romagna]. To seek justice, we accept the legal risks.&#x27;<br><br>Eco-vandals in Italy could now be fined up to £50,000 under the new bill. The law aims to stop such protests, giving officials the power to levy fines of between 20,000 euros (£17,000) to 60,000 euros (£50,000).<br><br>Like Just Stop Oil in the UK and other countries, the Italian branch of Last Generation Their goal has been to draw attention to the climate crisis, and have done so through big stunts targeting national monuments or by stopping traffic.<br><br>According to the European Commission, Italy is on track for significantly higher emissions than those set in its 2030 target.<br><br>The protests in Italy are part of a series of actions across Europe to focus attention on climate change.<br><br>Activists have thrown soup, cake, mashed potatoes and washable paint at heritage and culture sites and artworks in museums.<br><br>This January, a judge indicted three members of Italy&#x27;s Ultima Generazione (Last Generation, or UG) climate activism group.<br><br>This was after they sprayed orange removable paint over Maurizio Cattelan&#x27;s L.O.V.E., a sculpture in Milan of a hand with its middle finger raised, last year.<br><br>Three people aged between 23 and 29, poured orange paint over the stand on which the sculpture was displayed.<br><br>Cattelan himself wrote to the lawyers of the defendants, saying that the stunt had not ruined the artwork (commonly known as the finger). The 63-year-old artist said he did not feel &#x27;offended or harmed&#x27;.</p>

    <p>However, other stunts have provoked more angry reactions from the public.<br><br>Also last year, climate activists waded into the waters of Rome&#x27;s world-famous Trevi Fountain and poured in a black liquid to symbolise oil.<br><br>&#x27;Our country is dying,&#x27; they shouted after unfurling a banner, as tourists visiting the monument took photos, cheered and booed.<br><br>While the group said the liquid was carbon based and would not damage the fountain, Rome&#x27;s mayor said regardless, the city would have to throw away the 300,000 litres of water circulating the Trevi Fountain and replace it.<br><br>The group has also hurled paint at Milan&#x27;s famous La Scala opera house, food at the glass protecting iconic paintings, and sprayed the Italian Senate with orange paint.<br><br>Its members have also blocked traffic, infuriating motorists.<br><br>Several videos have shown the activists sitting across the middle of busy roads, causing long traffic jams during morning and afternoon rush hours.<br><br>This has invariably led to members of the public taking matters into their own hands, ripping banners out of the activists&#x27; hands and dragging them off the road.<br><br>In October irate motorists repeatedly kicked and dragged climate protesters blocking traffic in Milan.<br><br>Around 20 &#x27;Ultima Generazione&#x27; - translated as Last Generation - activists blocked a road, drawing the anger of several drivers left stuck in the resulting traffic.<br><br>Footage showed several activists sitting on a crossing point over the multi-lane road at a busy intersection, causing chaos for drivers during rush hour by linking hands and holding up an orange climate emergency banner.<br><br>Several drivers, furious at the protesters for blocking their way, got out of the cars and banded together to carry them off the road in shocking scenes caught on video.<br><br>Other climate activist groups have also been active in Italy.<br><br>In December, protesters from Extinction Rebellion used a dye to turn Venice&#x27;s famous Grand Canal green, in protest over what they said at the time was a lack of progress at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai .<br><br>Activists from the group were seen dangling from the Rialto Bridge over the canal with the aid of hard hats and climbing ropes, while displaying a banner that read: &#x27;COP28: While the government talks, we are hanging by a thread.&#x27;<br><br>And in 2022, Italian eco-zealots glued their hands to Botticelli&#x27;s masterpiece Primavera at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.<br><br>But in November, a judge in Florence ruled two activists who in 2022 glued their hands to the glass surrounding another Botticelli painting, also in the Uffizi, had not committed a crime.<br><br>That same year, 11 activists threw flour over a car painted by Andy Warhol that was on display in Milan&#x27;s Fabbrica del Vapore art centre.<br><br>Groups in the UK, like Just Stop Oil, have employed similar tactics in recent years.<br><br>In one instance, an activist cable-tied himself to the goal posts during a football match at Everton FC&#x27;s Goodison Park, provoking an angry reaction from the crowd.</p>
