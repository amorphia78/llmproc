    <p>On Tuesday morning, Jess Knowles carried her 20-month-old son Rico out of her terraced Victorian home in southwest London in a mad rush, conscious that she probably could not waste a minute if she was to make it on time to her child’s hospital appointment.<br><br>The stay-at-home mum was greeted by a disastrous sight after she walked over to the driver’s side of her black Jeep Night Eagle, a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that she uses through her disabled father’s mobility allowance — two deflated tyres.<br><br>After initially fearing that the tyres had been slashed, Knowles, 36, found that the valve caps had been stuffed to make them deflate, one with sunflower seeds and the other with crushed shards of pasta — a simple yet effective foil that meant that she could not make her son’s appointment.<br><br>Knowles’s car was one of over 40 SUVs and sports cars on the narrow tree-lined streets of Sands End to be targeted on Monday night by the Tyre Extinguishers, a group of activists aiming to “make it impossible” for city dwellers to drive “polluting death machines”.<br><br>The group, which launched in 2021, is a decentralised movement, with instructions on how to deflate a tyre with something as small as a lentil available on their website along with leaflets to be placed on people’s cars to explain the action.<br><br>Activists under the banner of the Tyre Extinguishers, who have no affiliation with campaign groups such as Just Stop Oil or Extinction Rebellion, have been taking their war to SUVs all over the world, including countries as far afield as Romania, America and Australia.<br><br>CCTV obtained by The Times showed three men wearing baseball caps tinkering with tyre valves in Sands End on Monday night, with the whole operation lasting just under a minute for each car.<br><br>“It’s so bad. They said that they’d keep doing it unless you change your vehicle,” Knowles said. “I’m looking out the window at night just to see if they’re outside. I don’t want anyone near my vehicle. They could put the wrong thing in there, they could flatten it for all I know… They don’t know why people need a vehicle.”.<br><br>Knowles did not display her badge when she parks at home because she has a residency permit, leaving her a target in the eyes of the Tyre Extinguishers, who claim to not target mobility vehicles if they see a disabled badge.<br><br>The action comes as The Times has learnt that Just Stop Oil, which has not held a protest since early December, will be launching a new campaign to lobby Labour candidates to sign a pledge that they will resign if a Labour government signs new oil and gas contracts.<br><br>The move represents a significant step by the group to engage in electoral politics. The Times understands that it was in part prompted by a belief that JSO had effectively sounded the alarm around the impact of new oil and gas contracts and that the next step would be political engagement.<br><br>A source told The Times that it represents a “diversification of tactics” and that “there was still a place for cultural actions” such as protests at the National Gallery.<br><br>“It’s about people in their community and in their regions kind of trying to take the power back and exercise their own autonomy to political actors that don’t represent them,” a source said.<br><br>“Given it’s an election year, politicians have to emerge from their shells. They have to crawl out the cracks and holes under the floorboards so we’re going to take this opportunity to engage with them directly,” the source added.<br><br>This comes as Roger Hallam, the co-founder of XR, Insulate Britain and JSO, has called for the need for balance in the climate movement and for activists to begin preparing for societal collapse.<br><br>The change, which is motivated by his belief that climate change will no longer be stopped, is a significant departure from Hallam’s previous position on the importance of public disruption to enact change, an approach that made him the architect one of the most disruptive and radical protest movements in modern British history.<br><br>In his New Year address, he told his followers he was working on a “profoundly different framing” for 2024.<br><br>“It goes something like: ‘Look, the carbon regime has totally f***ed up so the climate crisis is now locked in. We don’t need to create massive social disruption because it’s going to happen anyway! The regime will collapse under the weight of its own contradictions. So, what next? We need to build the next civilisation and stop fascism from taking us to a terminal hell’. Bit long but you get the idea,” he said.<br><br>Hallam said that he would outline different aspects of a “balanced revolution” by working on ideas such as how to hold public assemblies, how to door-knock and how to stand in elections.<br><br>“The mission is to empower people to see the big picture — one that transcends the traditional categories of politics, economics, social connection, and spirituality in favour of a new fusion of confrontation and dialogue,” he said.</p>

    <p>This also comes as the Reverend Mark Coleman, a climate campaigner who has twice been jailed for participating in Insulate Britain and JSO actions, stands for election in the upcoming Rochdale by-election.<br><br>Gail Bradbrook, another co-founder of XR, told The Times that the climate protest movement was incredibly focused on “preparing for the collapse of civilisation” by creating local assemblies to make decisions for the best of their community.<br><br>Bradbrook said that XR’s announcement last year that it would move away from disruptive tactics such as roadblocks and smashing windows was partly adopted because the tactic was being done by JSO.<br><br>“We [the climate protest movement] have to be more like nature,” she said. “Nature has ecosystems. It has different creatures for different purposes and they come alive at different times for different seasons.”<br><br>However, some experts believe that JSO has not been successful in holding protests of note in recent months and that this stagnation could give way to a newer more radical group to grow out of it.<br><br>Dr Paul Stott, of the Policy Exchange think tank, said that JSO has had little momentum in recent months due to its members being embroiled in legal battles, leaving the group needing to reinvent itself after running out of activists.<br><br>Last year during JSO’s last wave of action, the Metropolitan Police arrested 630 protesters from October 30 to December 4, with JSO data showing at least 276 people charged, more than 120 of whom under section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, a new power that bans any action that “interferes with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure”. Some cases arising in 2023 are now being listed in the crown court in 2025.<br><br>On Monday, three trials are due to begin involving climate activists, including five XR protesters charged with criminal damage for breaking glass at JP Morgan’s European Headquarters in 2021, eight Insulate Britain campaigners charged with public nuisance for stopping traffic on the M25 in the same year, and five JSO activists charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance for occupying tunnels close to Grays Oil Terminal in 2022.<br><br>This comes before the Court of Appeal considering whether the protesters can argue as a defence their belief that the property owner would have consented to the damage caused if they had been fully aware of the impact of climate change. The case has been prompted by the attorney-general, Victoria Prentis KC, after a spate of acquittals of protesters who have defaced buildings.<br><br>“One of the problems they’ve had is they’ve had so many court cases and people being arrested, re-arrested and convicted. Once organisations get into that position it becomes tricky,” Stott said. “They’ve been tied up in prison support campaigns and that sort of prison support although it’s necessary to maintain the morale of the group and its prisoners and their families, it rather saps the energy out of the campaigns”.<br><br>“One thing Roger Hallam tends to do is start campaigns and those campaigns have a high profile,” he said. “Insulate Britain for example hadn’t achieved its aims but the campaign petered out and was replaced by Just Stop Oil. It is more likely that another organisation will be started this summer, will flare, have some success, and fade again”.<br><br>However, some in the wider climate movement believe that there is growing awareness that a polarising approach will not bear fruit in trying to prevent climate change and prepare for the impact it will have on the world.<br><br>Rupert Read, a former member of XR and a founder of the Climate Majority Project, said that the group, which aims to bring the public along with it has welcomed a significant number of people with backgrounds in XR, Insulate Britain and JSO on to its email lists.<br><br>“The climate movement is moving in the direction of understanding that engagement needs to be much wider and that the majority of people ultimately need to be onside for this to work. You can’t win by [being] endlessly polarising,” he told The Times.<br><br>“There’s always going to be space for civil disobedience and the situation that we’re in merits all kinds of approaches to be tried. But it is absolutely imperative that we get more and more people onside, that we depolarize, that we ensure that climate is not a culture war issue.”<br><br>“What we’re trying to do fits in with the change in XR strategy last year to a somewhat more moderate direction… there is a lot of people a lot of thoughtful people from XR who understand what’s going on and can smell the coffee… ultimately, you have to do something more than raise the alarm.”</p>
