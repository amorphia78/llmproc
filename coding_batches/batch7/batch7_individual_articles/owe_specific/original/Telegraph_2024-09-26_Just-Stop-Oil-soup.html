    <p>The Just Stop Oil protesters who threw soup on a Van Gogh painting are daring iconoclasts, not criminals, art experts have claimed.<br><br>More than 100 artists, curators and art historians are pleading for two climate activists who defaced Van Gogh’s Sunflowers to be spared jail.<br><br>The painting itself was not damaged during the attack at London’s National Gallery in Oct 2022, but the frame surrounding it was.<br><br>Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland, both 22, will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on Friday after being found guilty of criminal damage during the demonstration.<br><br>Judge Hehir told the pair to be “prepared in practical and emotional terms to go to prison”.<br><br>However, artists including Fiona Banner, Peter Kennard and Love Ssega, the actor Juliet Stevenson, as well as arts academics from Essex, Goldsmiths, Queen Mary, New York and Copenhagen universities, claimed the act was in keeping with the ethos of the arts.<br><br>In a letter coordinated by Greenpeace UK and Liberate Tate, which campaigns against fossil fuel industry involvement in the arts, they said: “We are concerned by the courts’ defence of a false notion of artistic purity in their judgement and sentencing.<br><br>“Art can be, and frequently is, iconoclasm. These activists should not receive custodial sentences for an act that connects entirely to the artistic canon.”</p>

    <p>Such iconoclasm has been recognised as part of art for more than 120 years, they said, citing the work of artists including Banksy, who shredded one of his paintings during an auction in 2018.<br><br>The artists added: “The work of all these iconoclasts, often far more physically destructive than the work of JSO, is now venerated in museums around the world.”<br><br>Areeba Hamid, a co-executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: “We sincerely hope the judge will listen carefully to the artists’ arguments.<br><br>“We need to stop locking away peaceful protesters in our overcrowded prisons simply for raising the alarm on a burning planet.”<br><br>Darren Sutton, from Liberate Tate, said: “When Liberate Tate started making performance interventions to protest BP sponsorship of Tate in 2010 we were dismissed as irreverent outsiders.<br><br>“Now our campaign is long won, museum and gallery directors vie for the strength of their position on tackling climate change, and all but one have shunned oil sponsorship.<br><br>“The initial reaction to soup thrown will undoubtedly shift as we as a society catch up with the threat climate change poses to our way of life. Phoebe and Anna’s act will be seen as the poetic protest it surely is, unworthy of custodial punishment.</p></body></html>
