    <p>Just Stop Oil activists who took part in a slow march across Waterloo Bridge have been told by a judge that they can continue taking part in &#x27;peaceful&#x27; protests before their 2025 trial.<br><br>Stephen Simpson, 70, Barbara Lund, 70, David Mitchell , 62, Patrick Walker, 34, Andrew Bellis, 44 and Peter Lillie, 31, joined the Just Stop Oil demo on November 8.<br><br>They all denied an offence contrary to the Public Order Act 2023 at Southwark Crown Court today.<br><br>According to the charge they &#x27;interfered with the use or operation of a key national infrastructure in England and Wales, namely Waterloo Bridge, intending that act to interfere with the use or operation of such infrastructure or being reckless as to whether it would do so&#x27;.<br><br>The six were told they will not stand trial until 2025.<br><br>Judge David Tomlinson said he was prepared to relax earlier bail conditions, preventing five of the six defendants from coming within the M25.<br><br>He said the latest condition &#x27;does not stop anyone from taking part in a peaceful protest.<br><br>&#x27;What it stops them from doing is participating in a procession which prevents members of the public from going about their lawful business.</p>

    <p>&#x27;We are talking about competing rights here and this condition does not stop them protesting, it does however stop them from preventing people from going about their lawful business.<br><br>&#x27;This condition of bail is entirely proportionate to anyone who was given instruction by police.<br><br>&#x27;It is proportionate to try and stop any of you being accused of any further offences between now and the trial date.&#x27;<br><br>Simpson, of Belmont Cresent, Bradford, Lund, of Lyde Green Lane, Frome, Mitchell, of Cumberland Road, Bristol, Walker, of Harlequin Drive, Newport, Bellis, of Kinseys Lane, Cheshire and Lillie of Mendip Road, Bristol, all denied one count of interfering with the use of a key national infrastructure.<br><br>They will return to court for further hearings on 19 January and 12 April 2024, but their trial is unlikely to be heard until 2025.<br><br>The condition does not apply to Simpson because he has been allowed unconditional bail throughout.</p>
