    <p>New footage shows Just Stop Oil&#x27;s pink-haired poster girl being arrested after delivering a letter to Emily Thornberry&#x27;s house.<br><br>Phoebe Plummer, 22, is a prolific protester who has been arrested for a string of disturbances.<br><br>In March, she was detained on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle and of sending a malicious communication after the Mail exposed an alleged plot to target MPs.<br><br>The privately-educated activist has now been arrested for breaching her bail conditions, with footage showing her walking up to MP Emily Thornberry&#x27;s door.<br><br>The video posted on social media shows Plummer posting the letter with a friend. It then cuts to show several police officers asking if she has ID.<br><br>An officer then returns, and said: &#x27;We&#x27;ve just spoken to our inspector... you will be under arrest for breaching police bail conditions.&#x27;<br><br>He then asks if she was aware of the bail conditions not to attend a MP&#x27;s home address.<br><br>Speaking to the camera, she then said: &#x27;So apparently this is the world we live in now. Getting arrested, literally for just posting a letter through to somebody&#x27;s house...somebody&#x27;s front door.<br><br>&#x27;That&#x27;s so far from a crime, isn&#x27;t it?&#x27;<br><br>To which the police officer replied: &#x27;You&#x27;ve got these bail conditions for a reason, haven&#x27;t you.&#x27;<br><br>She responded: &#x27;To prevent that. This is what it was trying to prevent. Just delivering a letter.&#x27;<br><br>The video cuts to footage of a police van arriving, and Plummer climbs in before turning and waving, saying: &#x27;See you guys later!&#x27; and laughs.<br><br>The clip ends with a promotional message reading &#x27;Everything is fine&#x27; - referencing a crowdfunded documentary &#x27;telling the inside story of activists in Just Stop Oil&#x27;, filmed by Rich Felgate - who posted the arrest video.<br><br>Just Stop Oil previously posted footage on social media of Plummer in handcuffs during her arrest in Vauxhall, south London last month.<br><br>When officers explain the charges she laughed and said: &#x27;This is bizarre.&#x27;<br><br>Detectives launched an investigation into her eco group after the Mail On Sunday revealed a plan by activists to &#x27;occupy&#x27; MPs&#x27; homes ahead of the General Election.<br><br>Det Supt Sian Thomas, who is leading the Met inquiry, said after the arrest: &#x27;The safety and security of MPs and other elected officials is taken extremely seriously.</p>

    <p>&#x27;It is completely unacceptable to target MPs and elected officials at their home address and we will respond robustly to anyone who seeks to undermine our democratic values this way.&#x27;<br><br>In a follow-up, the MoS revealed how the activists had circulated a manual to help protesters track down politicians&#x27; homes.<br><br>The guide recommended studying photos of MPs clapping for carers during Covid for clues to their addresses.<br><br>It also said obtaining personal details of politicians&#x27; partners and children can help identify family homes.<br><br>The JSO manual, which was available via the group&#x27;s website, said targeting MPs might involve breaking windows, throwing paint, occupying the property with a banner or placard, letting off stink bombs and deflating car tyres.<br><br>At the time, JSO spokesman accused the MoS of getting &#x27;in a tizz&#x27; about &#x27;ordinary people taking the power back&#x27; and described their actions as &#x27;democracy in action.&#x27;<br><br>Pink-haired Plummer grew up in privilege, raised in a £4million family home near the King&#x27;s Road in Chelsea and privately educated at £45,000-a year St Mary&#x27;s School in Ascot, Berkshire, then £34,000-a-year Mander Portman Woodward College in Kensington, west London.<br><br>The top-class education helped her secure straight A* grades in chemistry, computer science and maths A-levels, winning a spot on a Manchester University computer science course - but she ended up reading social anthropology at SOAS University Of London.<br><br>She was last registered as living in a large house in Clapham, south London, owned by the Church of England as a private home for a priest and their family. It&#x27;s unclear why Plummer was living there.<br><br>Scotland Yard said a 22-year-old woman was arrested on March 6 on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle and sending a malicious communication.<br><br>A statement from the Met said: &#x27;This followed extensive inquiries by a specialist team of Metropolitan Police Service investigators following reports in a national newspaper.<br><br>&#x27;In this reporting activists from Just Stop Oil allegedly called on followers to target elected officials at their homes and places of work.&#x27;<br><br>MailOnline has contacted the Met Police for comment.</p>
