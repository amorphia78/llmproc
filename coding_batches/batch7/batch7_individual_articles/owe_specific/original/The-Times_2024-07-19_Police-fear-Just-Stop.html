    <p>The record jail sentence for the co-founder of Just Stop Oil could serve as a “rallying call” to other climate activists for a wave of protests, police believe.<br><br>Roger Hallam, 58, was jailed for five years on Thursday for orchestrating protests that disrupted the M25 over four days in November 2022 when 45 protesters climbed gantries on various parts of the motorway, forcing police to stop traffic.<br><br>Daniel Shaw, 38, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, Louise Lancaster, 58, and Cressida Gethin, 22, were each given four years after being found guilty along with Hallam of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.<br><br>The sentences, handed down by Judge Christopher Hehir, are thought to be the longest ever given for peaceful protest and have been widely criticised.<br><br>The prime minister is facing calls to repeal the raft of anti-protest laws that were introduced by the Conservatives over the past two years.<br><br>Detective Inspector Chris Rudd, who led the investigation, said there were “certainly signals from the [activist] groups” that they intended to stage a protest in retaliation to the sentences.<br><br>He told The Times: “The judge commented upon sentencing that he hoped it may have some deterrent effect on others that wanted to cause serious disruption to members of the public. I do hope it does have some deterrent effect. But for some, it might be a rallying call.”<br><br>The five ­Just Stop Oil activists were recorded by an undercover reporter for The Sun during a Zoom call in which they discussed the planned ­protests and were aiming to recruit others.<br><br>They were sentenced under legislation introduced by the previous government to get tougher on disruptive tactics used by ­environmental protesters, including blocking roads and attacks on sporting events. A United Nations human rights commissioner condemned the measures as “deeply troubling” and “disproportionate”.<br><br>Rudd, who oversees most environmental protests in London, said the protesters were known to police before the covert recording. “There is mention of this being a simple Zoom call resulting in people ending up in prison for five years, but to be absolutely clear: the call contained compelling evidence of them engaging in a plan to conduct what is criminal activity. They wanted to cause absolute gridlock and chaos.”<br><br>During the trial, Metropolitan Police officers were stationed at court to deal with disruption from the defendants.</p>

    <p>Rudd said less than 10 per cent of Just Stop Oil activists who appear in court plead guilty, compared with about 50 per cent in groups such as Extinction Rebellion, whose members followed the “longstanding tradition” of protesters “taking [punishment] on the chin”.<br><br>He added: “Most [Just Stop Oil activists] will self-represent at trial, making the trial process much longer. And as we’ve seen recently, make the trial itself a protest ground.”<br><br>The court was told that the M25 protests delayed more than 700,000 vehicles and caused economic damage of £765,000, and the cost to the Met was more than £1.1 million.<br><br>Hallam and the others will not qualify for early release after 40 per cent of their time is served as the emergency scheme is only in place for 18 months and will expire before they qualify.<br><br>• Labour announces early release for 5,500 prisoners<br><br>Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the former justice secretary and lord chancellor, has said the sentences make him feel “very uncomfortable”.<br><br>He said: “I am not criticising the judge because I am sure the judge is going with whatever the sentencing guidelines are. But these are people who are not violent criminals.<br><br>“They cause enormous irritation to a large number of people. However, to be sentencing people to four and five years in prison for that is maybe an indication as to why the prisons are so full. Maybe prison was appropriate, I don’t dispute that — but for that length of time, I feel uncomfortable at that. But there can be an appeal.”<br><br>John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said: “Post Office destroys lives, water companies pollute our rivers, [the Criminal Cases Review Commission] leaves innocent people to rot in prison, Covid ministers’ incompetence costs thousands of lives, but nobody is punished. Stop traffic on M25 and get five years in prison. This is brutally unjust.”<br><br>Sir Robert Buckland, the former Tory justice secretary, said the sentences were “fully justified and entirely merited”.<br><br>He said: “I hope it sends a very clear message to self-appointed campaigners that they have to be held accountable for their actions as well, just like everyone else and they are not above the law. There is a silent majority who are fed up with random forms of protest that cause widespread disruption. We’re law-abiding people in this country who want to be protected.”</p>
