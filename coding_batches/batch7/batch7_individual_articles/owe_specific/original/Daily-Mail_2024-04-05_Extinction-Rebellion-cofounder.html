    <p>Extinction Rebellion&#x27;s co-founder has been spared jail after plotting to close Heathrow by flying drones near the airport.<br><br>Roger Hallam and other eco-activists launched the protest, under the name Heathrow Pause, in a bid to close the transport hub and force the Government to abandon its plans for third runway, London&#x27;s Isleworth Crown Court was told.<br><br>A number of arrests were made during the protest in September 2019, but instead of hundreds of people attending to fly drones, the &#x27;movement died where it was&#x27;, the court heard.<br><br>The policing cost to the public was in excess of £1 million, and 1,600 officer shifts had to be moved, the court was told.<br><br>Hallam and co-defendant Larch Maxey said in their defence they had no intent to cause a public nuisance or to close Heathrow, it was &#x27;merely a publicity exercise&#x27;, which was rejected by the jury, James Curtis KC, prosecuting, said.<br><br>Hallam, 57, of Wandsworth, south London, and Maxey, 51, of no fixed abode, were each sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for 18 months.<br><br>Hallam and Maxey were found guilty of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance on December 15 last year after a four-week trial.<br><br>Michael Lynch-White, 33, of Lewes, Sussex, previously pleaded guilty to the same charge.<br><br>Valerie Milner-Brown, 71, of Islington, north London, was found not guilty of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.<br><br>Hallam, Maxey and Lynch-White conspired with others on or before September 14 2019 to close the transport hub to air traffic by the &#x27;unlawful flying&#x27; of drones within Heathrow&#x27;s flight restriction zone, the court heard.<br><br>Mr Curtis said the intention was &#x27;not to close it for a day, but some documents say a week, two weeks&#x27; and he said there are documents which show the intention was to close Heathrow &#x27;indefinitely until the Government would agree publicly to reverse a national policy permitting the third runway extension at Heathrow&#x27;.<br><br>There was no intention to cause any crash or to harm or endanger lives of individuals, but with the &#x27;intention of causing inevitable chaos to the public&#x27;, Mr Curtis said.<br><br>Mr Curtis said documents show the intention was to cause &#x27;massive disruption to the public, to flights in and out of this country&#x27;.<br><br>Heathrow Airport and the police had to go to &#x27;inordinate lengths to prepare for the worst&#x27;, Mr Curtis said.</p>

    <p>Hallam and Maxey were &#x27;instrumental in either the creation or carrying through of this plan&#x27; and Lynch-White also was &#x27;closely involved&#x27;, the prosecution said.<br><br>Hallam, representing himself, said the &#x27;public nuisance was insignificant to non-existent in my case&#x27; and there was &#x27;no evidence&#x27; he played a leadership role in this offence.<br><br>He added: &#x27;The public nuisance was simply to create publicity for the criminality of creating a third runway.&#x27;<br><br>Michael Goold, defending Maxey, said the defendant was &#x27;motivated by the sincere heartfelt concern, and justified concern, about the climate emergency&#x27;.<br><br>Raj Chada, defending Lynch-White, said: &#x27;During the course of his work, he becomes aware of the dangers of the climate crisis.&#x27;<br><br>Judge Martin Edmunds KC said the plan was developed under the banner of Heathrow Pause and there was evidence Extinction Rebellion members chose not to become involved as they &#x27;valued plans to be too extreme&#x27;.<br><br>He added that the small number of drones flown &#x27;did not cause any disruption to flights&#x27;.<br><br>Hallam and Maxey were each sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for 18 months.<br><br>Lynch-White was handed 17 months, suspended for 18 months.<br><br>Hallam was told to complete 200 hours of unpaid work, Maxey has to complete 300 hours and Lynch-White will have to complete 262 hours. All three defendants will have to complete 10 rehabilitation activity requirement days.<br><br>Before the sentencing, Maxey told the PA news agency: &#x27;It&#x27;s really striking, the injustice of this whole situation, those that have contributed least to this crisis are suffering most and soonest, and injustice when people like myself try and raise the alarm and then we are potentially threatened with prison.<br><br>&#x27;Prison is for violent and sexual offenders it is not for peaceful protesters, so we need to protect our democracy and protect the right to protest.&#x27;<br><br>Lynch-White said before the sentencing that he thought the incident was &#x27;extremely unlikely to cause any disruption&#x27;.<br><br>He added: &#x27;And it turns out it didn&#x27;t cause any disruption.<br><br>&#x27;The reason for that is there was absolutely no threat to anybody.&#x27;</p>
