    <p>Three Just Stop Oil supporters have denied carrying out an attack on two Van Gogh paintings after soup was thrown at them hours after other activists were jailed, a court heard.<br><br>The paintings, both versions of Vincent Van Gogh’s Sunflowers, were targeted at the National Gallery in central London on Friday shortly after two Just Stop Oil activists were jailed for pouring soup over a Sunflowers by the Dutch artist in October 2022.<br><br>Stephen Simpson, 71, Mary Somerville, 77, and Phillipa Green, 24, pleaded not guilty to criminal damage at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Monday.<br><br>Prosecutor James Bowker said the frames of the paintings had been damaged, adding that an antique frame owned by the National Gallery, estimated to be worth £10,000 to £20,000, would “likely require lengthy restoration”.<br><br>He said the value of the other frame, on loan from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, was “unknown, but likely to be in a similar range”, adding that neither painting itself was damaged.<br><br>Mr Bowker said damage to the artworks would have a “serious social impact”, adding the Sunflowers “are loved by millions of people around the world and in the UK”.<br><br>The prosecutor said the value of damage “could be a high total” once it is assessed.<br><br>The prosecutor told the court that the defendants entered the Van Gogh: Poets and Lovers exhibition at the art museum in Trafalgar Square at around 2.30pm on Friday.<br><br>Mr Bowker said that Simpson and charity worker Green threw soup onto a painting on the left of the gallery and retired teacher Somerville threw soup onto a painting on the right.</p>
