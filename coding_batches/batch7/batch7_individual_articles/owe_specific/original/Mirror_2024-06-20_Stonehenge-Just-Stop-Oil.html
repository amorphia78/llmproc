    <p>Just Stop Oil protesters who sprayed Stonehenge with orange-coloured corn and paint flour, causing fury across the UK, have been named.<br><br>The activists were caught on camera rushing towards the ancient monument in Wiltshire wearing white t-shirt with the campaign group’s logo. As people yelled at them to stop, they unleashed canisters of orange substances as several of the ancient stones were covered in the bright colour.<br><br>The two protesters were unveiled as Rajan Naidu, 73, and Niamh Lynch, 21. Naidu is believed to be a Quaker from Birmingham while the younger campaigner is a youth representative at the British Trust for Ornithology and an officer from the Oxford University’s Nature Conservation Society. Wiltshire Police have today revealed the arrested pair were released on bail. They said in a statement: “This is to allow us additional time to work with specialists and progress our inquiries.<br><br>&quot;A man in his 70s and a woman in her 20s were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, damaging an ancient monument and deterring a person from engaging in a lawful activity. It follows reports that an orange substance had been sprayed on some of the stones by two suspects. We also continue to work closely with English Heritage.”<br><br>English Heritage chief executive Dr Nick Merriman said this morning there does not appear to be “visible damage” to Stonehenge. Dr Merriman told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme: “It’s difficult to understand and we’re deeply saddened about this vandalism, but we’ve been really touched by the messages of sympathy and support we’ve had.</p>

    <p>“Our experts have already managed to clean the orange powder from the stones because we were really worried about what would happen if they got in contact with water. So far, there seems to be no visible damage. The site is open to the public again and for the solstice tomorrow.<br><br>“It’s vandalism to one of the world’s most celebrated ancient monuments. We wish people would channel their protests away from cultural heritage sites, museums and galleries because we feel that doesn’t actually help their cause, and causes huge upset and disruption to the operation of these important sites.”<br><br>In an earlier statement, a Just Stop Oil spokesperson explained: “The UK’s government in waiting has committed to enacting Just Stop Oil’s original demand of ‘no new oil and gas’. However, we all know this is not enough. Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything. That’s why Just Stop Oil is demanding that our next government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.<br><br>“Failure to commit to defending our communities will mean Just Stop Oil supporters, along with citizens from Austria, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland will join in resistance this summer, if their own Governments do not take meaningful action. Stone circles can be found in every part of Europe showing how we’ve always cooperated across vast distances – we’re building on that legacy.”</p></body></html>
