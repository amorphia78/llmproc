I didn&#x27;t even really know what was happening. But thankfully the cops were there and kept us safe, because that&#x27;s, you know, that&#x27;s just weird stuff.&quot;<br><br>It came after the tournament was also delayed on Saturday when three people were injured after lightning struck a tree close to the course.<br><br>The protest caused a delay to play of around five minutes. The tournament was later won by Scheffler in a play-off.<br><br>The world number one, who was himself arrested while driving during last month&#x27;s PGA Championship, praised the police response.

    <p>&quot;That can be a stressful situation, and you would hate for the tournament to end on something weird happening because of a situation like that.&quot;<br><br>Extinction Rebellion blamed climate change for the lightning and wider storm on Saturday, telling the AP news agency it was &quot;due to increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather conditions&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Golf, more than other events, is heavily reliant on good weather. Golf fans should therefore understand better than most the need for strong, immediate climate action,&quot; the group said.<br><br>Some of the crowd around the 18th green booed and shouted insults at the protesters during the incident. At one point they also chanted &quot;U-S-A&quot;.<br><br>The smoke bombs and powder left behind a white and red residue on the putting surface, which was cleaned up by groundstaff using leaf blowers.<br><br>Read more from Sky News:Four-day heat alert issued for EnglandWhat we know about Jay Slater disappearancePirates Of The Caribbean actor killed by shark<br><br>Be the first to get Breaking News<br><br>Install the Sky News app for free<br><br>Fellow golfer Kim said: &quot;They left a lot of marks on the greens, which is not right for us players - especially when two guys are trying to win a golf tournament.<br><br>&quot;But I&#x27;m very grateful for the tour and the tour security for handling that really well and making us players feel a lot safer.&quot;</p>
