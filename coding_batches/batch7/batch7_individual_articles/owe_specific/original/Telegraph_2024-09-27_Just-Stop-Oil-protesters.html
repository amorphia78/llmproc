    <p>“Are you more concerned about the protection of a painting, or the protection of our planet and people? The cost of living crisis is part of the cost of oil crisis.”<br><br>Sentencing the eco-activists, Judge Christopher Hehir said the painting could have been “seriously damaged or even destroyed”.<br><br>“Soup might have seeped through the glass,” he continued.<br><br>“You couldn’t have cared less if the painting was damaged or not.<br><br>“You had no right to do what you did to Sunflowers.”<br><br>Plummer also received a three-month jail term for her part in a slow march which caused long tailbacks in west London in November 2023.</p></body></html>
