    <p>  A small group of people managed to sit down on another road and were detained after ignoring police orders to leave.<br><br>  Extinction Rebellion activists have blocked the highway that runs past the temporary home of the Dutch parliament more than 30 times to protest against subsidies.<br><br>  The demonstrators waved flags and chanted: “We are unstoppable, another world is possible.”<br><br>  One held a banner reading: “This is a dead end street.”<br><br>  In February, Thunberg, 21, was acquitted by a court in London of refusing to follow a police order to leave a protest blocking the entrance to an oil and gas industry conference last year.<br><br>  Her activism has inspired a global youth movement demanding stronger efforts to fight the climate crisis since she began staging weekly protests outside the Swedish parliament in 2018.<br><br>  She has repeatedly been fined in Sweden and the UK for civil disobedience in connection with protests.</p></body></html>
