    <p>&quot;The general election has neither fixed our broken system nor addressed the urgent action needed to tackle the climate and nature emergency.<br><br>&quot;Aristocrats, oligarchs and corporate interests have infected and distorted our politics and media for their own benefit and at our expense.<br><br>By Julia Atherley<br><br>ECO zealots at Extinction Rebellion raked in £1.5million last year — but paid just £1,039 in tax.<br><br>The activists, famed for glueing themselves to buildings and blocking streets, revealed the bumper income in accounts for the company which funds its campaigns.<br><br>But Compassionate Revolution said its £1.486million costs and administration expenses meant it made a profit of just £27,784.<br><br>As a result, the company paid £1,039 in corporation tax, leaving it with a profit of £26,745 for the 12 months to the end of June 2023.<br><br>XR leader Gail Bradbrook, who once accused banks of &quot;wholesale tax-dodging&quot; after smashing the window of a branch in Stroud, Gloucs, signed off the accounts.<br><br>The group has also blockaded Amazon depots — accusing the company of stealing from the public by &quot;depriving governments of tax revenue&quot;.<br><br>The company handles XR&#x27;s income from donations, crowdfunding, NGOs and foundations.<br><br>It says it distributes the cash to help those protesting over the &quot;climate and ecological emergency&quot;.<br><br>Its income to June 2023 was less than the £1.6million it received in the previous year.<br><br>&quot;Our politics is failing us from top to bottom. It&#x27;s time for a democratic upgrade.<br><br>&quot;We demand better at all levels; from the head of state to local councils but our central demand is for a Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Climate and Ecological Justice, which is needed more urgently now than ever before.&quot;<br><br>However Windsor Great Park has been practising sustainable land use for hundreds of years.<br><br>And the Crown Estate has a commitment to hit Net Zero carbon emissions by 2030.</p>
