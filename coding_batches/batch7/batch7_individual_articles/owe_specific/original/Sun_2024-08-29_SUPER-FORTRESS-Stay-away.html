Behind the barriers is a paved area with an ornate lamp post and trees visible in the background. The barriers appear to be restricting access to what looks like the grounds of a formal building or estate on a clear, sunny day." width="100%">

In the foreground, workers in high-visibility vests are installing metal security barriers near the castle gates. A truck is positioned on the left side, apparently delivering or setting up the barriers. Several people can be seen walking on the pathway. The enhanced security measures are clearly visible as temporary metal fencing extends across the area in front of the historic royal residence." width="100%">

    <p>&quot;The general election has neither fixed our broken system nor addressed the urgent action needed to tackle the climate and nature emergency.<br><br>&quot;Aristocrats, oligarchs and corporate interests have infected and distorted our politics and media for their own benefit and at our expense.<br><br>By Julia Atherley<br><br>ECO zealots at Extinction Rebellion raked in £1.5million last year — but paid just £1,039 in tax.<br><br>The activists, famed for glueing themselves to buildings and blocking streets, revealed the bumper income in accounts for the company which funds its campaigns.<br><br>But Compassionate Revolution said its £1.486million costs and administration expenses meant it made a profit of just £27,784.<br><br>As a result, the company paid £1,039 in corporation tax, leaving it with a profit of £26,745 for the 12 months to the end of June 2023.<br><br>XR leader Gail Bradbrook, who once accused banks of &quot;wholesale tax-dodging&quot; after smashing the window of a branch in Stroud, Gloucs, signed off the accounts.<br><br>The group has also blockaded Amazon depots — accusing the company of stealing from the public by &quot;depriving governments of tax revenue&quot;.<br><br>The company handles XR&#x27;s income from donations, crowdfunding, NGOs and foundations.<br><br>It says it distributes the cash to help those protesting over the &quot;climate and ecological emergency&quot;.<br><br>Its income to June 2023 was less than the £1.6million it received in the previous year.<br><br>&quot;Our politics is failing us from top to bottom. It&#x27;s time for a democratic upgrade.<br><br>&quot;We demand better at all levels; from the head of state to local councils but our central demand is for a Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Climate and Ecological Justice, which is needed more urgently now than ever before.&quot;<br><br>However Windsor Great Park has been practising sustainable land use for hundreds of years.<br><br>And the Crown Estate has a commitment to hit Net Zero carbon emissions by 2030.</p>

In the foreground, a blue tractor pulls a green trailer filled with equipment or debris. Metal security barriers line the road near the building's entrance, creating a protective perimeter. The medieval-style architecture features thick stone walls and narrow windows typical of historic fortifications." width="100%">
