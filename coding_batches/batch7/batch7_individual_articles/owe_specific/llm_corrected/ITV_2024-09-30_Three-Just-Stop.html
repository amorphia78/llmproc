    <p>Three Just Stop Oil supporters have denied carrying out an attack on two Van Gogh paintings after soup was thrown at them hours after other activists were jailed, a court heard.<br><br>The paintings, both versions of Vincent Van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers, were targeted at the National Gallery in central London on Friday shortly after two Just Stop Oil activists were jailed for pouring soup over a Sunflowers by the Dutch artist in October 2022.<br><br>Stephen Simpson, 71, Mary Somerville, 77, and Phillipa Green, 24, pleaded not guilty to criminal damage at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court on Monday.<br><br>Prosecutor James Bowker told the court that the defendants entered the Van Gogh: Poets and Lovers exhibition at the art museum in Trafalgar Square at around 2.30pm on Friday. Simpson and charity worker Green threw soup onto a painting on the left of the gallery and retired teacher Somerville threw soup onto a painting on the right.<br><br>The trio then took off their coats to reveal t-shirts which said &quot;Just Stop Oil&quot; on them, the court heard.<br><br>The frames of the paintings had been damaged, with an antique frame owned by the National Gallery, estimated to be worth £10,000 to £20,000, likely requiring &quot;lengthy restoration&quot;. The value of the other frame, on loan from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, was &quot;unknown, but likely to be in a similar range&quot;. Neither painting itself was damaged.</p>

The painting depicts vibrant yellow sunflowers in a vase against a blue background. Below the artwork, orange liquid appears to be dripping down the wall, suggesting it has been thrown at the painting. A small museum placard with the number "43" is visible on the wall next to the frame." width="100%">

    <p>Mr Bowker said damage to the artworks would have a &quot;serious social impact&quot;, adding the Sunflowers &quot;are loved by millions of people around the world and in the UK&quot;. The prosecutor said the value of damage &quot;could be a high total&quot; once it is assessed.<br><br>Defending, Raj Chada said the damage to the frames had not been assessed yet, adding: &quot;There was no damage to the paintings whatsoever. They have been covered by a very thick protective glass screen.&quot;<br><br>District Judge Minhas bailed Simpson, Somerville and Green with the condition of not entering the Greater London area within the M25 except for pre-arranged court appearances. The activists will next appear at Southwark Crown Court on October 28.</p></body></html>
