    <p>Eco-fanatics caused outrage yesterday by defacing Stonehenge on the eve of the summer solstice.<br><br>Just Stop Oil activists used fire extinguishers to spray orange powder paint on at least three of the ancient stones before calmly sitting down cross-legged in front of the world-famous site.<br><br>Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer showed a rare united front in their condemnation of the stunt, which raised new questions about the historically intimate relationship between the Labour Party and Just Stop Oil. The Prime Minister described it as a &#x27;disgraceful act of vandalism&#x27;, while the Labour leader branded the group &#x27;pathetic&#x27;.<br><br>Yet Labour was accused of &#x27;faux outrage&#x27; after JSO boasted of planning its action &#x27;days after the Labour Party recommitted to halting all future oil and gas licences&#x27; – a policy the activists claim was influenced by their extremist road-blocking tactics.<br><br>Mr Sunak rounded on major Labour backer Dale Vince, who, until last year, bankrolled the environmental protest movement. He said: &#x27;This is a disgraceful act of vandalism. Just Stop Oil should be ashamed of their activists and they and anyone associated with them, including a certain Labour party donor, should issue a condemnation of this shameful act immediately.&#x27;</p>

    <p>Labour has accepted more than £5 million from Mr Vince, including £1 million after the election was called. The green energy tycoon supported JSO from its foundation and donated at least £340,000 before cutting off the cash last October.<br><br>Police arrested two protesters – named by the group as Rajan Naidu, 73, from Birmingham, and Oxford student Niamh Lynch, 21 – on &#x27;suspicion of damaging the ancient monument&#x27;.<br><br>Lynch said: &#x27;Stonehenge at solstice is all about celebrating the natural world – but look at the state it&#x27;s in! Standing inert for generations works well for stones – not climate policy.&#x27;<br><br>Naidu, who is understood to be a Quaker, added: &#x27;Either we end the fossil-fuel era, or the fossil-fuel era will end us.&#x27;<br><br>Just Stop Oil said: &#x27;Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything.&#x27;</p>
