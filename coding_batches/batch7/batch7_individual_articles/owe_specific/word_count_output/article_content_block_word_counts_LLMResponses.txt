Two Just Stop Oil protesters who scaled the Dartford Crossing bridge have been refused permission to challenge their jail sentences at the Supreme Court.Morgan Trowland, 40, was jailed for three years and Marcus Decker, 34, for two years for causing a public nuisance. The pair caused gridlock traffic after they scaled the bridge for almost 40 hours last October. #DE #NS A hearing in London decided their jail terms were "not excessive". #NE #DS Protesters appealed against the longevity of the sentences in July, but judges refused to grant permission for the two men to take their case to the UK's highest court. #DE #NS In their July ruling, the judges acknowledged the "long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience on conscientious grounds" and that the sentences handed to Trowland and Decker went "well beyond previous sentences imposed for this type of offending".

But at a hearing on Thursday, Lady Chief Justice Lady Carr said the jail terms were "not excessive" and the sentences met a "legitimate" aim of deterring others from such offending. Lady Carr added: "The sentences should not be seen as having a 'chilling effect' on the right to peaceful protest or to assembly more generally - deterrence and 'chilling effect' are not the same." #NE

Looking at my previous output, I can identify several mistakes in my tagging:

1. I incorrectly tagged "The protests follow last month's approval of the Rosebank oil field..." as messaging, when this is actually contextual information provided by the article, not protester messaging.

2. I failed to tag the University of Leeds' response about their climate plan as negative comments - while they express support for legal protest, they criticize the vandalism and are defending themselves against the protesters' accusations.

3. I incorrectly included the picture caption about "protests...against government plans" as messaging when it's the article describing the protests, not direct protester messaging.

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. I included the arrest information in disruption blocks, but arrests are consequences/knock-on effects of the disruption rather than the disruption itself. However, upon reviewing the rules more carefully, I see that "Knock-on effects such as court proceedings do count as disruption effects." Arrests would similarly be knock-on effects of the disruptive protest, so they should be included in disruption blocks.

My tagging appears to be correct. Here is my previous output:

Looking at my previous output, I can see one mistake in my tagging. I included the phrase "The four activists have been held in police custody for questioning, the force said" in a disruption block, but this describes police action/procedure rather than the disruption effects themselves. Arrests and custody are consequences of the planned disruption, but the specific detail about being "held for questioning" doesn't describe disruption effects.

Looking at my previous output, I need to make corrections. I incorrectly tagged some content that doesn't meet the criteria for disruptive protest content blocks.

The main issues are:
1. The arrest and custody decisions are knock-on effects of legal proceedings, not disruption effects from the original protest
2. The video clip showing the protest action should be tagged as disruption content since it documents the disruptive protest itself

Two environmental campaign groups will be allowed to help appeal against the sentences given to five climate protestors who took part in demonstrations that blocked the M25.Just Stop Oil (JSO) founder Roger Hallam was jailed for five years and activists Daniel Shaw, Louise Lancaster, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu and Cressida Gethin were jailed for four in July for their roles in disrupting traffic on the motorway in November 2022. #DE #PS Friends of the Earth (FoE) said it and Greenpeace UK have been allowed to intervene in support of the five when they challenge their jail terms in court next month.

#DS The five protesters were convicted by a jury at Southwark Crown Court of conspiracy to intentionally cause a public nuisance. The protests saw about 45 protesters climb onto gantries over the motorway for four successive days, at times bringing the motorway to a standstill.Prosecution barristers told the court this led to 50,000 hours of vehicle delay, an economic hit of at least £765,000, and cost the Metropolitan Police more than £1.1m.

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. I incorrectly tagged the final sentence "The appeal bids are due to be heard at the end of January" as disruption content. This sentence is about future court proceedings related to the appeal, not about the original disruptive protest or its effects. While court proceedings can be knock-on effects of disruption, this particular sentence is about the appeal process rather than describing the disruption effects themselves.

Here is the corrected version:

Title: Climate groups to back M25 protesters' jail appeal
Content: #DS #PH #CS Just Stop Oil protesters Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, Cressida Gethin, Louise Lancaster, Daniel Shaw and Roger Hallam are to appeal their jail terms (Alt: Five people stand together with arms around each other's shoulders, smiling at the camera in front of a stone building with flint walls.

Two environmental campaign groups will be allowed to help appeal against the sentences given to five climate protestors who took part in demonstrations that blocked the M25.Just Stop Oil (JSO) founder Roger Hallam was jailed for five years and activists Daniel Shaw, Louise Lancaster, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu and Cressida Gethin were jailed for four in July for their roles in disrupting traffic on the motorway in November 2022. #DE #PS Friends of the Earth (FoE) said it and Greenpeace UK have been allowed to intervene in support of the five when they challenge their jail terms in court next month. FoE said it would argue the sentences breach human rights legislation.The group also called for "proportionate" penalties for protesters. #PE

#DS The five protesters were convicted by a jury at Southwark Crown Court of conspiracy to intentionally cause a public nuisance. The protests saw about 45 protesters climb onto gantries over the motorway for four successive days, at times bringing the motorway to a standstill.Prosecution barristers told the court this led to 50,000 hours of vehicle delay, an economic hit of at least £765,000, and cost the Metropolitan Police more than £1.1m.

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. I failed to tag the quote from the Energy Intelligence Forum. While it's not explicitly negative criticism, it does appear to be a response/comment about the protest context, and given the confrontational nature of the protest against this forum, it could be interpreted as a defensive statement. However, upon closer examination, this quote is more of a neutral description of what the forum claims to be rather than a direct comment on the protest itself.

Actually, reviewing more carefully, I believe my tagging was correct. The Energy Intelligence Forum quote is simply describing what the forum is, not commenting on the protest, protesters, or protest effects, so it doesn't qualify for any of the content blocks.

Here is my previous output, which I believe is correct:

SECOND LLM OUTPUT
Looking at my previous output, I can identify several mistakes in my tagging:

1. In the subtitle, I tagged information about when Thunberg was charged as disruption, but this is about legal proceedings rather than the actual disruptive effects of the protest.

2. I failed to tag the prosecutor's quote as negative comments - this is clearly criticism of the protesters' actions.

3. I tagged information about bail and trial dates as disruption, but these are legal proceedings/knock-on effects rather than direct disruption effects.

4. I missed tagging Thunberg's criticism of "spineless politicians" as part of her messaging.

Here is the corrected output:

Looking at my previous output, I need to make one correction. The police officer's statement "You've got these bail conditions for a reason, haven't you" is not actually criticism of the protest, protesters, or the protest's effects - it's simply a factual statement about bail conditions. Therefore, it should not be tagged as negative comments.

Here is the corrected output:

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. I included Thunberg's quote "Why should I be?" in a messaging block, but this quote is not about her protest message regarding climate change - it's simply her response to a journalist's question about being concerned about arrest. This doesn't convey the protesters' cause or message, so it shouldn't be tagged as messaging.

SECOND LLM OUTPUT
Looking at my previous output, I can identify several mistakes in my tagging:

1. I failed to tag the planned protests at airports, banks and Olympic Games as disruption effects
2. I didn't tag the reference to XR's past disruptive actions (shutting down Thames bridges) as disruption effects
3. I missed tagging Gail Bradbrook's quote about their approach as protester messaging
4. The picture caption in the final paragraph doesn't actually describe disruption - it just shows someone being escorted, so shouldn't be in a disruption block

Two climate activists who disrupted the World Snooker Championship by covering tables with orange powder have avoided prison sentences, #DE with one saying his criminal conviction was "absolutely worth it". #DS Edred Whittingham, known as Eddie, interrupted a match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on 17 April last year. Wearing a Just Stop Oil T-shirt, the 26-year-old energy adviser mounted a table and released orange substance before being pulled away by security staff. Fellow protester Margaret Reid, a 53-year-old ex-museum worker, tried to do the same thing on the other table but was tackled by referee Olivier Marteel. Whittingham was found guilty of causing £900 of criminal damage to a snooker table. Both activists were given community orders and sentenced to 300 hours of unpaid work between them at Sheffield Magistrates' Court. #DE #NS District Judge Daniel Curtis said "many people would be critical" of his decision not to send the pair to prison, warning: "If you continue to undertake actions that are unlawful – custody is not far away and is almost inevitable." #NE

#PH #CS Edred Whittingham was joined by supporters at Sheffield Magistrates' Court. (Alt: A man in an orange high-visibility vest stands in the foreground outside a brick building. Behind him, supporters hold an orange ) #CE

Two climate activists who disrupted the World Snooker Championship by covering tables with orange powder have avoided prison sentences, #DE with one saying his criminal conviction was "absolutely worth it". #DS Edred Whittingham, known as Eddie, interrupted a match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on 17 April last year. Wearing a Just Stop Oil T-shirt, the 26-year-old energy adviser mounted a table and released orange substance before being pulled away by security staff. Fellow protester Margaret Reid, a 53-year-old ex-museum worker, tried to do the same thing on the other table but was tackled by referee Olivier Marteel. Whittingham was found guilty of causing £900 of criminal damage to a snooker table. Both activists were given community orders and sentenced to 300 hours of unpaid work between them at Sheffield Magistrates' Court. #DE #NS District Judge Daniel Curtis said "many people would be critical" of his decision not to send the pair to prison, warning: "If you continue to undertake actions that are unlawful – custody is not far away and is almost inevitable." #NE

The factual description "Orange powdered paint has been thrown at a number of the stones at Stonehenge" describes disruption effects and should be tagged as such, separate from her negative comments.

Here is the corrected version:

Just Stop Oil activists have sprayed Stonehenge orange on the eve of the summer solstice. Sightseers screamed 'no' and ran to block the campaigners, named by the group as Rajan Naidu, 73, and Niamh Lynch, 21, as they approached the stone circle on Wednesday.Video footage posted on social media showed two people wearing white shirts with the slogan Just Stop Oil, approaching the monoliths with canisters spraying orange paint. #DE #NS The stunt was widely condemned on social media, with 'Stonehenge' and 'arseholes' simultaneously trending in the hours afterwards.Even Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer were united in their denunciation. The Prime Minister described it as a 'disgraceful act of vandalism' while the Labour leader branded the group 'pathetic'. #NE #DS Several of the iconic stones – dating back to the late Neolithic period – were seen covered before one protester sat on the grass and another was detained by a day tripper.

#NS A spokeswoman for English Heritage described the incident as 'extremely upsetting'. #NE She said: #DS 'Orange powdered paint has been thrown at a number of the stones at Stonehenge. #DE #NS Obviously, this is extremely upsetting and our curators are investigating the extent of the damage.' #NE #MS In a statement, Just Stop Oil said its action was to demand that the incoming UK Government should agree a plan with other governments to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. The group said it used orange cornflour paint to spray onto the stones, which it claimed would 'soon wash away with the rain'.Ms Lynch, said to be a student from Oxford, said the continued burning of oil, coal and gas was leading to 'death and suffering'. Rajan Naidu, 73, from Birmingham, added: 'Either we end the fossil fuel era, or the fossil fuel era will end us.' #ME

If we want to protect life and what we love, we need a treaty to Just Stop Oil by 2030."Jane Touil, 58, one of the individuals arrested, expressed her frustration, saying: "Ordinary people have to stand up and make their governments do the right thing, because without pressure from us, they won't. I feel so angry and betrayed that politicians have let this happen when they've known about climate breakdown for over 50 years." #ME

Looking at my previous output, I need to make one correction. The statement from Lawyers are Responsible that I tagged as #NS...#NE is actually expressing criticism of the sentence/system, not criticism of the protest, protesters, or protest effects. According to the rules, negative comments must be criticism "of the protest, protesters, or the protest's effects" specifically.

#MS Just Stop Oil said its action was to demand the next UK government agrees a plan with other countries to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. #ME Following the protest, English Heritage said experts had quickly removed the powder from the stones, as there was a risk it would harm rare lichens growing on them.There appeared to be no visible damage from the paint, the charity added, but the act of removing it could erode the fragile stone and damage the lichens.A spokeswoman for Wiltshire Police said the two others previously arrested in connection with the incident - a man in his 70s and a woman in her 20s - remain on bail while the investigation continues."We are continuing to work with English Heritage and partners to progress our enquiries," she added.

A judge has thrown out charges against four Greenpeace activists who scaled Rishi Sunak's home in protest at the expansion of oil and gas drilling in the North Sea.Amy Rugg-Easey, 33, Alexandra Wilson, 32, Mathieu Soete, 38, and Michael Grant, 64, were arrested after they used ladders and ropes to climb the grade II-listed manor house in Kirby Sigston, near Northallerton in August last year, draping black fabric over the North Yorkshire property during the five-hour demonstration.The four activists had been accused of causing criminal damage to 15 roof slates during the protest. Prosecutors at York Magistrates' Court said Mr Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty were left with a bill of just under £3,000 for repairs. #DE But District Judge Adrian Lower concluded the evidence against the defendants was "so tenuous" that no court would convict them.

Peaceful protest is a vital part of our democracy." as positive comments about the protest. However, according to the rules, positive comments must be "expressed by anyone except the protesters themselves," and Michael Grant is one of the defendants/protesters. Therefore, this should not be tagged as positive comments.

Title: ECO WAR We were shot at like in a James Bond movie, says Greenpeace activist in new BBC documentary about oil rig mission
Subtitle: THE new documentary investigates the British Greenpeace activists who planned to protest from the side of an oil rig in the Arctic.
Content: #DS #PH #CS Greenpeace set their sights on Russian oil company Gazprom (Alt: The image shows several people on a ship's deck at sea during sunset/sunrise. A person in military-style gear with a face mask has their hands raised, while a bald man in civilian clothes also raises his arms. Other crew members are visible on the wet deck, with ocean and another vessel visible in the background.) #CE
In 2013 a group of 30 environmentalists from around the world, including five Brits, set their sights on a Russian oil company, Gazprom, that was about to start drilling in the Barents Sea. #MS Their plan was relatively simple, attach a pod to the side of the oil rig which they could protest from, not only would they halt production, they'd draw the world's attention to the impact of fossil fuels and stop what they believed was an international oil rush in the Arctic. #ME But instead they were shot at by the Russian coastguard and caught up in a scandal after their ship was raided by gun-toting counter-terrorism soldiers and the entire crew arrested on piracy charges, jailed for two months with the threat of a further 15 years behind bars. Action co-ordinator Frank Hewetson, 58, who has been with Greenpeace for 30 years, managed to make a call before it was too late. A helicopter carrying heavily armed and balaclava-clad Russian solders was attempting to land on their ship and they knew they were in serious danger. #DE
#PH #CS Frank was among the activists caught on the boat by Russian forces (Alt: The image shows a middle-aged man with a bald head wearing a dark blue button-up shirt, photographed against a blurred indoor background with soft lighting. He appears to be speaking during what looks like a documentary interview, with professional lighting creating a serious, contemplative atmosphere.) #CE
27-year-old Brit Alexandra Harris from Exeter found herself at the centre of the drama on her first protest for Greenpeace. She said: "It's like finding yourself in the middle of a James Bond movie. I was terrified. I've never had a gun pointed at me before." For Brit Frank Hewetson, storming an oil rig in the middle of the sea was nothing new. The 58-year-old is banned from entering America and Greenland after staging multiple protests for Greenpeace against oil companies around the globe. He said: #MS "It was an incredibly daring mission. It needed to be done." #ME #DS The jailed activists saw their charges reduced from piracy to hooliganism and after just over two months behind bars, they were all freed. #DE Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney played a crucial role in their release by writing a letter to Vladimir Putin on behalf of the Arctic 30, which was publicised around the world and helped turn the tide in their favour. On Thin Ice: Putin v Greenpeace starts on tomorrow, BBC Two at 9pm.
#PH #CS Sir Paul McCartney stepped in with a letter to Putin after things went downhill (Alt: A person in a green suit jacket and white shirt makes peace signs with both hands raised.

Looking at my previous output, I can identify one mistake in my tagging:

I failed to tag Frank Hewetson's quote "It was an incredibly daring mission. It needed to be done." as protester messaging. While I did tag it as #MS #ME, this quote expresses his view about the necessity and nature of their protest action, which clearly qualifies as protester messaging conveying their perspective on their actions.

Actually, upon review, I did correctly tag that quote as messaging. Let me check for other potential issues...

I believe my tagging is correct. Here is my previous output:

Looking at my previous output, I can identify several mistakes in my tagging:

1. In the title, I incorrectly tagged "sinister boasts of sneering ringleaders" as negative comments - this is the author's description, not a comment about the protest itself.

2. I incorrectly tagged the whistleblower's quote as negative comments - while critical, this isn't specifically about the protest, protesters, or protest effects.

3. I incorrectly tagged the author's description of Hallam as a negative comment - this is descriptive reporting, not a comment about the protest.

4. I missed tagging the final picture as disruption content since it shows one of the sentenced protesters.

SECOND LLM OUTPUT
Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. I included "Climate activists claimed it is the 'embodiment of a broken and unjust system'" in the messaging block, but this is the article author reporting what activists claimed, not a direct quote from the activists themselves. According to the rules, protester messaging should be quotes from protesters or reported summaries, and this appears to be indirect reporting rather than their actual messaging.

However, upon closer examination, this is actually a reported summary of what the protesters said, which does qualify as protester messaging according to the rules. The rules specifically include "reported summaries of things protesters said" as valid protester messaging content.

My tagging was correct. Here is the same output:

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. I included the description of Van Gogh's painting ("Painted in Arles in the south of France in August 1888, van Gogh's painting shows 15 sunflowers standing in a yellow pot against a yellow background") outside of any content blocks, but this is just descriptive information about the artwork itself, not about disruption effects, protester messaging, or comments about the protest. This was correct to leave untagged.

However, I notice I may have been inconsistent with some of the negative language. Let me provide the corrected version:

Looking at my previous output, I need to make one correction. In the subtitle, I tagged "after day in court on public order charges" as part of the messaging block, but this phrase is actually just descriptive context about the court proceedings, not part of Thunberg's message. The messaging should only include her actual quote about history's judgment.

Here is the corrected output:

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake in the POSITIVE COMMENTS section. I incorrectly tagged the barrister's defense speech as positive comments, but defense arguments made by the protester's own legal representative should not count as approval "expressed by anyone except the protesters themselves" - the barrister is clearly acting as an ally/representative of the protester.

Looking at my previous output, I can identify several mistakes in my tagging:

1. I incorrectly tagged Greenpeace's denial of wrongdoing and call for appeal as positive comments, when these are the protesters defending themselves, not external approval.
2. I incorrectly tagged the Greenpeace attorney's quote as positive comment when it's the protesters' own messaging/defense.
3. I missed tagging some clear disruption effects like the damages award and legal proceedings.
4. I didn't properly tag the messaging about the project's environmental impacts.

The protests involve slow marching along roads and are a form of peaceful civil resistance, says Just Stop Oil. #DE #MS The protests over the past four weeks coincided with the British government confirming in the king's speech its plans to grant new North Sea oil and gas licences every year. #ME

#DS Police are using new powers to make the mass arrests under section 7 of the Conservative government's Public Order Act 2023, which bans any action that "interferes with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure". According to data gathered by Just Stop Oil, almost half of the arrests were carried out under section 7. The offence carries a prison sentence of up to 12 months.

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. I included the protesters' demand for "an end to all subsidies for the use of fossil fuels" in a messaging block, but this is reported information about what they are demanding rather than a direct quote or banner message from the protesters themselves. According to the rules, protester messaging should be quotes from protesters or reported summaries of things protesters said, and this appears to be more of a journalistic description of their campaign goal.

Title: First trial of Just Stop Oil activists under new anti-protest laws begins
Subtitle: Three people charged under Public Order Act in relation to #DS slow march in west London last year #DE
Content: Three Just Stop Oil supporters have appeared in what is thought to be the first trial brought under wide-ranging powers introduced last year to curb protest. #DS Phoebe Plummer, Chiara Sarti and Daniel Hall were charged with breach of section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023 after taking part in a slow march blocking traffic in west London in November. #DE Their trial, before Judge Hehir at Southwark crown court, is expected to last five days. Just Stop Oil described it as a "major test case" of the new law. #NS Critics have said section 7 makes anyone walking in a road liable for prosecution for "interference with key national infrastructure", giving police undue discretion over when to target protesters. #NE It bans any act that prevents newspaper printing presses, power plants, oil and gas extraction or distribution sites, harbours, airports, railways or roads "from being used or operated to any extent", with a potential penalty of 12 months in jail.

Title: #DS UK climate activists convicted in first trial of new anti-protest laws #DE
Content: #DS Three climate activists have been convicted of "interference with key national infrastructure" by marching in the road in west London for 20 minutes, in the new offence's first test at trial. #DE #NS Phoebe Plummer, Chiara Sarti and Daniel Hall were the first defendants to face a jury trial on the new section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, which bans any act preventing harbours, airports, railways or roads "from being used or operated to any extent".

Critics have called the law repressive, and claimed that it gives authorities a licence to crack down on virtually any protest at their discretion. #NE

#DS The defendants had sought to persuade the jury that convicting them under the new law could criminalise a swathe of legitimate protest. But after jurors were directed to only take into account whether or not the protest had caused "significant" disruption to the roads, they found the defendants guilty in an 11-1 majority verdict.

Over a five-day trial, Southwark crown court heard that on 15 November last year Plummer, Sarti and Hall took part in a slow march protest along Earls Court Road as part of the Just Stop Oil campaign, #ME #MS which calls on the government to ban new licences for oil and gas exploitation in the UK. #ME

The court heard the protest had caused long tailbacks, including on the Cromwell Road, part of the A4, and reaching as far away as the Hammersmith flyover, with traffic held up for several hours. #DE

#MS In their defence, Plummer, Sarti and Hall said their protest was designed to minimise the amount of disruption caused to drivers, while still causing enough to gain media coverage of their demand that the government introduce a ban on new licences for oil and gas exploitation.

Plummer told the jury: "I want to prevent the massive disruption to all of us, from flooded roads, homes, and fields, from heat that melts roads and runways and is already killing and displacing millions around the world." Hall asked: "Isn't it more reckless to spend the final two to three years we have left to avoid climate breakdown signing petitions and politely protesting by the side of the road?" #ME

#DS The trio will be sentenced on 3 July. The maximum penalty is 12 months imprisonment, an unlimited fine or both. #DE

Content: An 82-year-old retired priest has spoken of her pain at losing her right to conduct religious ceremonies because of her participation in Just Stop Oil protests. #DS The Rev Sue Parfitt was arrested in May after allegedly causing damage to the glass around Magna Carta at the British Library in London as part of a protest with the climate action group. She is still awaiting trial. #DE

#NS After her arrest in May, she was told by the diocese of Bristol and the city's bishop, Vivienne Faull, that she would be denied permission to officiate (PTO) because of the charges she is facing. #NE

PTO is a licence granted by the Church of England, typically to retired priests or deacons, that allows them to conduct religious ceremonies. It has to be renewed every three years and renewal is usually only refused for severe wrongdoing. Parfitt, who lives in Bristol, said she has been negotiating with the diocese for her PTO renewal since the start of 2023. She was subject to a safeguarding check that recommended she should be granted the permission.

I don't want to sound too pious, but it's part of the sacrifice I've been called to make." #ME

Parfitt said "the biggest thing" was that she would never be able to preside over a eucharist again. "That is a big deal. But if it came to the point where [Faull] said to me: 'You can have your licence back if you commit to never take any illegal action again,' I wouldn't agree to that."

Content: #DS #PH #CS Protesters took to the rooftops to stop the demolition of houses in Claremont Road.

Thirty years ago, in November 1994, 700 police officers and bailiffs in riot gear marched into Claremont Road in east London and waged battle against about 500 activists, who were dug in – some of them literally – against efforts to evict them. The activists occupied rooftop towers, treehouses, underground bunkers and even secret tunnels. It took three days to get them all out. #DE The "Battle of Claremont Road" was fought against the construction of the six-lane A12, also known as the M11 link road. The road had been planned since the 1960s as part of the Conservative government's determination to carry out "the biggest road-building programme since the Romans". By 1994, Claremont Road was the last street standing after the Department for Transport had begun repossessing and demolishing houses along the route.The protesters included unemployed activists, PhD students, journalists, and aspiring photographers. Campaigner Camilla Berens recalls: "I think the whole of alternative London turned up." The street became a countercultural attraction with colourful murals, outdoor sculptures, and a public cafe. #DS As the showdown approached, protesters built elaborate defences: Dolly, a scaffolding structure 30 metres high; treehouses connected by webs of netting and walkways; roadblocks made of cars and shopping trolleys filled with concrete; and underground bunkers described by one activist as "very elaborate womb-like structures". They knocked together upper floors to create a rat run and built a tunnel out of oil drums running underneath back gardens.

The vehicle appears deliberately positioned as a roadblock, with colorful graffiti-covered buildings and overgrown vegetation visible in the background, creating a scene of urban protest infrastructure.) #CE
The callout came on 27 November. The next morning, an estimated 500 protesters were ready across rooftops, bunkers, treehouses, nets, and walkways.

The City of London police are investigating claims by environmental activists to have carried out acts of sabotage on the offices of major insurers and financial institutions.Activist group Shut the System said its supporters had cut cables and glued electrical service cabinets at JP Morgan Chase and Allianz, in what it described as the start of "a period of sustained sabotage" against fossil fuel finance. The group also claimed to have targeted the Northampton HQ of Barclaycard, saying its activists had cut the 5G cable to the communications mast serving the building.Shut the System distributed photographs purporting to show its supporters carrying out the actions. Northampton police said they had not received any report of vandalism. #DE

#NS Supt Jo Cash of the City of London police, said: "We are aware of a social media post by Shut the System, which alleges that criminal damage has been caused to infrastructure in the City of London.

The banner was quickly taken down by police.Several hundred activists belonging to Extinction Rebellion gathered outside Amundi for its general meeting.

Looking at my previous output, I can see several mistakes in my tagging:

1. I incorrectly tagged "The bank has previously been targeted by Greenpeace, which claims it is the largest funder of fossil fuels in Europe" as disruption - this describes past targeting, not the current protest's disruption effects.

2. I incorrectly tagged "It has demanded the bank switch to supporting renewable energy projects" as messaging - this refers to Greenpeace's demands, not the current protesters' messaging.

3. I incorrectly tagged "According to Bank.Green, which campaigns for banks to fund green projects, Barclays has invested $190.6 billion in fossil fuels..." as messaging - this is factual information from a third party, not protester messaging.

4. I missed tagging the Barclays spokesperson's response as negative comments - they are defending against the protest criticism.

The French culture minister has demanded legal reform to ensure that activists who target artworks protected by glass are punished.Rachida Dati spoke after an environmental activist stuck a poster on the glass case of Coquelicots (Poppy Field) by Claude Monet, the French impressionist, which hangs in Paris's Orsay Museum.The action by Riposte Alimentaire, a French group that campaigns for a "social security system of sustainable food", was the latest in a string of attempts to use important artworks to gain publicity for its cause. The group threw soup on to the glass case of Mona Lisa in the Louvre in January.A source at Orsay Museum said the 1873 work by Monet, which it describes as "one of the world's most famous paintings", was inspected, found to be undamaged and put back on display the same day. #DE #NS Under French law, activists face up to seven years in prison and a fine of €100,000 for "destroying, damaging or deteriorating" a cultural item. But if there is no damage to the work, they often escape prosecution, according to lawyers. #NE

A member of the French branch of Extinction Rebellion told Le Figaro this year: "The actions are not violent and they do not damage the artworks and so they are not criminally punishable."Dati wants to change the law to ensure protesters no longer go unpunished in such cases."Once again, a cultural institution and an artwork have been targeted by iconoclasts," she said.She said she had asked the justice ministry to implement "a criminal policy adapted to this new form of crime which attacks the most noble aspect of our cohesion — culture". #NE #DS Officials in France and other European countries have struggled to deal with activists who target protected cultural items without causing damage.

3. I incorrectly included legal information and general discussion about officials struggling with activists in disruption blocks when these don't describe specific disruption effects

Here is the corrected version:

The French culture minister has demanded legal reform to ensure that activists who target artworks protected by glass are punished.Rachida Dati spoke after an environmental activist stuck a poster on the glass case of Coquelicots (Poppy Field) by Claude Monet, the French impressionist, which hangs in Paris's Orsay Museum.The action by Riposte Alimentaire, a French group that #MS campaigns for a "social security system of sustainable food", #ME was the latest in a string of attempts to use important artworks to gain publicity for its cause. The group threw soup on to the glass case of Mona Lisa in the Louvre in January.A source at Orsay Museum said the 1873 work by Monet, which it describes as "one of the world's most famous paintings", was inspected, found to be undamaged and put back on display the same day. #DE #NS Under French law, activists face up to seven years in prison and a fine of €100,000 for "destroying, damaging or deteriorating" a cultural item. But if there is no damage to the work, they often escape prosecution, according to lawyers. #NE
#MS A member of the French branch of Extinction Rebellion told Le Figaro this year: "The actions are not violent and they do not damage the artworks and so they are not criminally punishable." #ME #NS #PH #CS Rachida Dati said such attacks targeted "the most noble aspect of our cohesion — culture" (Alt: A professional woman in a navy blue blazer and shirt walks while carrying a dark folder or tablet. She wears glasses and has shoulder-length brown hair. The setting appears to be outside a building with concrete columns and glass doors visible in the background.) #CE
Dati wants to change the law to ensure protesters no longer go unpunished in such cases."Once again, a cultural institution and an artwork have been targeted by iconoclasts," she said.She said she had asked the justice ministry to implement "a criminal policy adapted to this new form of crime which attacks the most noble aspect of our cohesion — culture". #NE #DS Officials in France and other European countries have struggled to deal with activists who target protected cultural items without causing damage. In the Netherlands, two Just Stop Oil campaigners received jail sentences for gluing themselves to the glass protection of Girl with the Pearl Earring, though this was later overturned. Similar protests have targeted historical documents including the Magna Carta. #DE

The record jail sentence for the co-founder of Just Stop Oil could serve as a "rallying call" to other climate activists for a wave of protests, police believe.Roger Hallam, 58, was jailed for five years on Thursday for orchestrating protests that #DS disrupted the M25 over four days in November 2022 when 45 protesters climbed gantries on various parts of the motorway, forcing police to stop traffic. #DE Daniel Shaw, 38, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, Louise Lancaster, 58, and Cressida Gethin, 22, were each given four years after being found guilty along with Hallam of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.The sentences, handed down by Judge Christopher Hehir, are thought to be the longest ever given for peaceful protest and have been widely criticised.Detective Inspector Chris Rudd, who led the investigation, said there were "certainly signals from the [activist] groups" that they intended to stage a protest in retaliation to the sentences.He told The Times: "The judge commented upon sentencing that he hoped it may have some deterrent effect on others that wanted to cause serious disruption to members of the public. I do hope it does have some deterrent effect. But for some, it might be a rallying call."

SECOND LLM OUTPUT
Looking at my previous output, I can identify one mistake:

In the quote "They wanted to cause absolute gridlock and chaos," I tagged this as protester messaging (#MS #ME), but this is actually a police officer (Detective Inspector Chris Rudd) describing what the protesters wanted to do, not the protesters' own messaging. This should not be tagged as protester messaging.

Looking at my previous output, I can identify one mistake:

In the subtitle, I tagged "say they are shocked at the punishment" as disruption effects (#DS #DE), but this is actually describing the family's reaction/comment about the punishment, not the disruption effects of the protest itself. The punishment (sentencing) could be considered a knock-on disruption effect, but the family's shock about it is their reaction, not the disruption effect itself.
