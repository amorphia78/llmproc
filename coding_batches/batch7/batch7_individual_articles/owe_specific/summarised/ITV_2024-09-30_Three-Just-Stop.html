    <p>Three Just Stop Oil supporters have denied carrying out an attack on two Van Gogh paintings after soup was thrown at them at the National Gallery in central London on Friday.<br><br>Stephen Simpson, 71, Mary Somerville, 77, and Phillipa Green, 24, pleaded not guilty to criminal damage at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court on Monday. The paintings, both versions of Vincent Van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers, were targeted during the Van Gogh: Poets and Lovers exhibition at the art museum in Trafalgar Square.<br><br>Prosecutor James Bowker told the court that the defendants entered the exhibition at around 2.30pm on Friday. Simpson and charity worker Green threw soup onto a painting on the left of the gallery and retired teacher Somerville threw soup onto a painting on the right.<br><br>The trio then took off their coats to reveal t-shirts which said &quot;Just Stop Oil&quot; on them, the court heard.<br><br>The frames of the paintings had been damaged, with an antique frame owned by the National Gallery, estimated to be worth £10,000 to £20,000, likely requiring &quot;lengthy restoration&quot;. The value of the other frame, on loan from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, was &quot;unknown, but likely to be in a similar range&quot;. Neither painting itself was damaged.</p>

    <p>Mr Bowker said damage to the artworks would have a &quot;serious social impact&quot;, adding the Sunflowers &quot;are loved by millions of people around the world and in the UK&quot;. The prosecutor said the value of damage &quot;could be a high total&quot; once it is assessed.<br><br>Defending, Raj Chada said the damage to the frames had not been assessed yet, adding: &quot;There was no damage to the paintings whatsoever. They have been covered by a very thick protective glass screen.&quot;<br><br>District Judge Minhas bailed Simpson, Somerville and Green with the condition of not entering the Greater London area within the M25 except for pre-arranged court appearances. The activists will next appear at Southwark Crown Court on October 28.</p></body></html>
