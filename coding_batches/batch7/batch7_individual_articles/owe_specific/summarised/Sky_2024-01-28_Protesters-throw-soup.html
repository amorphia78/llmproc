    <p>Two people were arrested following the incident, Paris police said.<br><br>A glass window protects the Mona Lisa, meaning the soup would not have covered the painting itself.<br><br>Riposte Alimentaire claims two people - aged 24 and 63 - involved with their &quot;new campaign&quot; were behind the incident to &quot;demand the establishment of sustainable food social security&quot;.<br><br>The world&#x27;s most famous artwork has been targeted before. In May 2022, cake was smeared on the covering, with bystanders claiming a &quot;man dressed as an old lady&quot; jumped out of a wheelchair before trying to smash the protective glass. The gallery explained the culprit had managed to get close to the portrait by &quot;simulating a disability&quot;, allowing them to take advantage of a policy designed to help people with mobility problems see the major works in its collection clearly.</p></body></html>
