    <p>The eco rabble previously announced they would stage a mass occupation outside Windsor Castle to protest against the King.<br><br>Climate activists claimed it is the &quot;embodiment of a broken and unjust system&quot;.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion says its occupation of Windsor Great Park is to urge the King to do yet more on green issues.<br><br>The protest, called Upgrade Democracy, will not specifically target the King or any individual, it claims.<br><br>Catherine Bartlett, of Extinction Rebellion UK, said: &quot;Windsor Castle has been chosen as an embodiment of a broken and unjust system where our message will resonate powerfully.<br><br>&quot;We demand better at all levels; from the head of state to local councils but our central demand is for a Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Climate and Ecological Justice, which is needed more urgently now than ever before.&quot;</p>
