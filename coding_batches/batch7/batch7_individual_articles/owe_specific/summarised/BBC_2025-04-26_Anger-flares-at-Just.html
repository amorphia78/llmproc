    <p>A van appears to have been driven slowly into Just Stop Oil (JSO) protesters as hundreds marched through London for their &quot;last day of action&quot;.<br><br>A mass of people wearing JSO&#x27;s orange vests rallied in Westminster on Saturday after the group claimed a victory on new oil and gas licences and said &quot;we&#x27;re hanging up the hi vis&quot;.<br><br>During the march, a man in a white minivan appeared to edge it forwards until it was pressed against protesters. Police appeared to successfully call for the crowd to move away.<br><br>The minivan was also carrying a child and at least one other passenger.<br><br>People standing front of the vehicle, some holding a JSO banner, were seen holding their hands up, with one shouting to the police &quot;officer, I&#x27;m being pushed back&quot;.<br><br>The driver exited the vehicle and could be heard remonstrating with the protesters about the road being blocked.<br><br>Police reminded the man the disruption was temporary and people had a right to protest.<br><br>Other similar incidents of drivers apparently becoming frustrated with people in the road were also caught on camera.</p>

    <p>In its March statement announcing the end of direct action, the group said: &quot;Just Stop Oil&#x27;s initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history.<br><br>&quot;We&#x27;ve kept over 4.4 billion barrels of oil in the ground and the courts have ruled new oil and gas licences unlawful.&quot;<br><br>The Labour government has said it will not issue licences for new oil and gas exploration, while a series of recent court cases have halted fossil fuel projects including oil drilling in Surrey, a coal mine in Cumbria and the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields in the North Sea over climate pollution.<br><br>Labour has distanced itself from Just Stop Oil, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer criticising its actions and saying protesters must face the full force of the law.<br><br>The Metropolitan Police have been approached for comment.</p>
