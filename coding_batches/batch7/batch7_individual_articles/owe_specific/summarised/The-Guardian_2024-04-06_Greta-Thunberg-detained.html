        <h1>Greta Thunberg detained at The Hague climate demonstration</h1><p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg was detained by police at a demonstration in The Hague, Netherlands, after joining protesters who tried to block a major highway into the city on Saturday.<br><br>The 21-year-old climate activist was put in a bus by local police along with other protesters who attempted to block the A12 highway. Thunberg had joined a protest by hundreds of activists and was detained when she joined a group of about 100 people who tried to block the road.<br><br>Before she was detained, Thunberg said: &quot;We are in a planetary emergency and we are not going to stand by and let people lose their lives and livelihood and be forced to become climate refugees when we can do something.&quot;<br><br>The Extinction Rebellion campaign group organized the demonstration, with activists demanding an end to all subsidies for the use of fossil fuels. The road has been blocked for several hours dozens of times in recent months by activists with the same demand.</p>

    <p>A heavy police presence, including officers on horseback, initially prevented the activists from getting on to the road. However, a small group of people managed to sit down on the highway and were detained after ignoring police orders to leave.<br><br>Extinction Rebellion activists have blocked the highway that runs past the temporary home of the Dutch parliament more than 30 times to protest against subsidies. The demonstrators waved flags and chanted: &quot;We are unstoppable, another world is possible.&quot; One held a banner reading: &quot;This is a dead end street.&quot;<br><br>Thunberg was seen flashing a victory sign as she sat in the bus used by police to take detained demonstrators from the scene. At previous protests, police drove detained protesters to another part of the city, where they were released without further consequences.</p></body></html>
