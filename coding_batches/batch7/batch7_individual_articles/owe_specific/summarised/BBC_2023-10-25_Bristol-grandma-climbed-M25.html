    <p>Ms Delap said she was unaware that an injunction was in place and apologised. She told the judge she had joined the protest after Just Stop Oil called for volunteers.<br><br>&quot;I heard a Just Stop Oil Zoom call for climbers to volunteer,&quot; Ms Delap said. &quot;I thought, well, I am 76, I have never had any climbing experience, I didn&#x27;t think I had to volunteer for that. But it went onto my mind and stayed there.&quot;<br><br>Ms Delap said she had climbed a ladder and sat on the gantry. &quot;Why did I do it? My heart is breaking for the future of my six grandchildren and all future generations.&quot;<br><br>She told the judge that Just Stop Oil wanted the government to &quot;stop new oil and gas&quot; and said &quot;the climate emergency is a serious issue and it has not been taken seriously enough&quot;.</p>
