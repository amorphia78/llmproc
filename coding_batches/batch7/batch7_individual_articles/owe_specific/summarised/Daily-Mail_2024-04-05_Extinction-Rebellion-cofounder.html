    <p>The intention was &#x27;not to close it for a day, but some documents say a week, two weeks&#x27; and there are documents which show the intention was to close Heathrow &#x27;indefinitely until the Government would agree publicly to reverse a national policy permitting the third runway extension at Heathrow&#x27;.<br><br>There was no intention to cause any crash or to harm or endanger lives of individuals, but with the &#x27;intention of causing inevitable chaos to the public&#x27; and &#x27;massive disruption to the public, to flights in and out of this country&#x27;.<br><br>Judge Martin Edmunds KC said the small number of drones flown &#x27;did not cause any disruption to flights&#x27;.<br><br>Hallam and Maxey were each sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for 18 months. Lynch-White was handed 17 months, suspended for 18 months.</p>
