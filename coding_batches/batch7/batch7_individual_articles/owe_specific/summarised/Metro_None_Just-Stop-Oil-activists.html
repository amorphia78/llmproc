    <p>Just Stop Oil activists have halted a West End performance of Les Miserables by invading the stage.<br><br>During a performance of the song One Day More, which involves waving a red flag, a group of four protesters stormed the stage and unfurled their own Just Stop Oil flag instead, to widespread boos from the crowd.<br><br>The protesters then chained themselves to the stage with bicycle locks, prompting the performance to be halted for around 20 minutes as the cast were forced backstage and the audience were ushered outside.<br><br>Among the protesters was 23 year old community worker Hannah Taylor, who said: &#x27;The show starts with Jean Valjean stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister&#x27;s starving child. How long before we are all forced to steal loaves of bread? How long before there are riots on the streets? The show cannot go on. We are facing catastrophe. New oil and gas means crop failure, starvation and death. It is an act of war on the global south and an utter betrayal of young people.&#x27;</p>

    <p>She added: &#x27;Rishi Sunak has just approved Rosebank, a new oil project in the north sea which will produce as much carbon as the annual emissions of the 28 lowest-income countries combined. It will lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths due to starvation as crops fail in the increasingly extreme weather conditions.&#x27;<br><br>Also in attendance was 19-year-old student Poppy Bliss from Nottingham, who said: &#x27;I am taking action with Just Stop Oil because I am absolutely terrified for my future. I don&#x27;t want to be disrupting people&#x27;s evenings out, but I have been left with no other choice. Our government is betraying the young and putting everyone&#x27;s futures on the line for the sake of a few votes.&#x27;<br><br>Although the reception from the crowd was unmistakably hostile, the actors reportedly had a different opinion, with one claiming most performers supported the protesters for trying to save the planet.</p></body></html>
