    <p>Climate activists have targeted Botticelli&#x27;s famed Birth of Venus painting as they stuck pictures of flooded towns on the glass protector at the Uffizi museum in Florence.<br><br>Two activists from Last Generation posted images of a flooded Tuscan town over the goddess&#x27; giant shell on the 15th-century art work, before being escorted to a police station, the campaign group said in a statement.<br><br>&#x27;The government continues to pretend that fields did not burn in January, that water will not be a problem this summer, that houses destroyed by floods are accidental events and not caused by human choices,&#x27; one of the protesters, Giordano, was quoted as saying.<br><br>&#x27;And instead of dealing with these real problems, it makes absurd laws&#x27; punishing climate activism, he said.<br><br>Italy&#x27;s parliament in January approved a law increasing penalties for people who damage monuments and cultural sites, following a series of climate protests.<br><br>&#x27;We ask the government to take concrete action to support communities affected by climate disasters. They can censor us, but they cannot censor reality,&#x27; the Italian branch of Last Generation wrote on X.</p>

    <p>On a fundraising page to cover &#x27;legal fees, travel and accommodation costs&#x27; for their activists, Last Generation reacted to the new law by writing: &#x27;Despite the &quot;ecoprotest&quot; law, despite precautionary measures, despite increasingly grotesque oppression, we do not stop and continue to take actions.<br><br>&#x27;We continue because there is no justice for the victims of landslides and floods [...].<br><br>&#x27;We demand that the government takes responsibility for caring for the victims of these disasters [in Campi Bisenzio and Emilia-Romagna]. To seek justice, we accept the legal risks.&#x27;<br><br>Eco-vandals in Italy could now be fined up to £50,000 under the new bill. The law aims to stop such protests, giving officials the power to levy fines of between 20,000 euros (£17,000) to 60,000 euros (£50,000).</p>
