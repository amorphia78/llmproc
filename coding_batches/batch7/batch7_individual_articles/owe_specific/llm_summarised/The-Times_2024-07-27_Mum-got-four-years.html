    <p>Louise Lancaster, a 58-year-old former special educational needs co-ordinator, has been sentenced to four years in prison for her role in the M25 protests that caused &quot;massive disruption&quot; over four days in November 2022.<br><br>Lancaster was one of five co-conspirators who attended a Zoom meeting to plan recruiting 45 volunteers to climb gantries over the M25. Judge Christopher Hehir told the court that Lancaster and her co-conspirators, Roger Hallam, 58, Daniel Shaw, 38, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, and Cressida Gethin, 22, had &quot;some time ago … crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic.&quot;<br><br>The protest caused &quot;massive disruption&quot;, including missed exams, funerals and cancer appointments. It allegedly cost the Met Police £1.1m and impacted around 700,000 vehicles, leaving the motorway &quot;compromised&quot; for more than 120 hours. Lancaster did not herself take part in the November protest, but she paid more than £1,000 to rent the Airbnb where protesters stayed, and also bought climbing equipment.</p>

    <p>On the Zoom call, Hallam, the co-founder of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, said that they intended to cause &quot;the biggest disruption in British modern history&quot; in an effort to force the government to meet one of Just Stop Oil&#x27;s core demands: an end to new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.<br><br>In a decision that has provoked fierce debate, Hallam was jailed for five years for conspiracy to cause a public nuisance, while Lancaster was sentenced to four years, along with Shaw, Whittaker De Abreu and Gethin. Lancaster, who studied maths at Oxford, had previously climbed a gantry on the M25 in an earlier protest in July 2022.</p>
