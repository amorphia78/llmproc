    <p>On their website, the group said: &#x27;As a thank you and a parting gift to Rishi Sunak and the Tories for the last 14 years of service, a Youth Demand supporter has &quot;sunk the Bismarck&quot; in Rishi Sunak&#x27;s lake. Youth Demand is a campaign calling for a two-way arms embargo on Israel and for the incoming UK government to revoke all new oil and gas licences granted since 2021.&#x27;<br><br>Before performing the deed, activist Oliver, 21, said: &#x27;We have so much to thank the Tories for: from crumbling schools, s*** in the rivers and a collapsing NHS; to creating a nation with more food banks than McDonalds and 4.3 million UK children living in poverty. From allowing their mates to get filthy rich from selling weapons to battle-test on toddlers in Gaza, or by drilling for more oil as the world burns – it&#x27;s quite a legacy!&#x27;</p></body></html>
