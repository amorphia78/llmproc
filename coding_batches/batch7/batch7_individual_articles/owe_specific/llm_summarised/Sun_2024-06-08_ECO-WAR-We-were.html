    <p>THE new documentary investigates the British Greenpeace activists who planned to protest from the side of an oil rig in the Arctic.<br><br>In 2013 a group of 30 environmentalists from around the world, including five Brits, set their sights on a Russian oil company, Gazprom, that was about to start drilling in the Barents Sea.<br><br>Their plan was relatively simple, attach a pod to the side of the oil rig which they could protest from, not only would they halt production, they&#x27;d draw the world&#x27;s attention to the impact of fossil fuels and stop what they believed was an international oil rush in the Arctic.<br><br>But instead they were shot at by the Russian coastguard and caught up in a scandal after their ship was raided by gun-toting counter-terrorism soldiers and the entire crew arrested on piracy charges, jailed for two months with the threat of a further 15 years behind bars.<br><br>Action co-ordinator Frank Hewetson, 58, who has been with Greenpeace for 30 years, managed to make a call before it was too late. A helicopter carrying heavily armed and balaclava-clad Russian solders was attempting to land on their ship and they knew they were in serious danger.</p>

    <p>27-year-old Brit Alexandra Harris from Exeter found herself at the centre of the drama on her first protest for Greenpeace. She said: &quot;It&#x27;s like finding yourself in the middle of a James Bond movie. I was terrified. I&#x27;ve never had a gun pointed at me before.&quot;<br><br>For Brit Frank Hewetson, storming an oil rig in the middle of the sea was nothing new. The 58-year-old is banned from entering America and Greenland after staging multiple protests for Greenpeace against oil companies around the globe. He said: &quot;It was an incredibly daring mission. It needed to be done.&quot;<br><br>The jailed activists saw their charges reduced from piracy to hooliganism and after just over two months behind bars, they were all freed.</p>
