    <p>Thirty years ago, more than 500 activists united to save a street – and their actions marked a major turning-point in the environmental movement<br><br>Thirty years ago, in November 1994, 700 police officers and bailiffs in riot gear marched into Claremont Road in east London and waged battle against about 500 activists, who were dug in – some of them literally – against efforts to evict them. The activists occupied rooftop towers, treehouses, underground bunkers and even secret tunnels. It took three days to get them all out.<br><br>The &quot;Battle of Claremont Road&quot; was fought against the construction of the six-lane A12, also known as the M11 link road. The road had been planned since the 1960s as part of the Conservative government&#x27;s determination to carry out &quot;the biggest road-building programme since the Romans&quot;. By 1994, Claremont Road was the last street standing after the Department for Transport had begun repossessing and demolishing houses along the route.<br><br>The protesters included unemployed activists, PhD students, journalists, and aspiring photographers. &quot;I think the whole of alternative London turned up,&quot; recalls campaigner Camilla Berens. The street became a countercultural attraction with colourful murals, outdoor sculptures, and a public cafe.<br><br>As the showdown approached, protesters built elaborate defences: &quot;Dolly&quot;, a scaffolding structure 30 metres high; treehouses connected by webs of netting and walkways; roadblocks made of cars and shopping trolleys filled with concrete; and underground bunkers described as &quot;very elaborate womb-like structures&quot;. They knocked together upper floors to create a &quot;rat run&quot; and built a tunnel out of oil drums running underneath back gardens.</p>

    <p>The callout came on 27 November. The next morning, an estimated 500 protesters were ready across rooftops, bunkers, treehouses, nets, and walkways. When police arrived in &quot;stormtrooper gear with batons raised&quot;, they found activists had drilled holes into the asphalt with lock-on bolts, lying down with their arms through holes and locking their wrists with handcuffs.<br><br>The protesters &quot;had a very strong commitment to non-violence&quot;, maintaining they needed to act &quot;in accordance with the values that we wanted to speak for&quot;. Police spent more than £1m on the eviction, using mechanical diggers, cherrypickers, and metal detectors to find the secret tunnel.<br><br>Though the road was built, the protest &quot;turned the roads programme into a political thing&quot; and paved the way for subsequent campaigns such as Reclaim the Streets, Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil.</p>
