    <p>IT was an audacious plot – and The Sun&#x27;s victorious bid to stop it could have come straight from a Hollywood thriller. On Thursday it came to an end in true blockbuster fashion, with record sentences handed down to the Just Stop Oil eco zealots who we had exposed over their November 2022 protest that brought the M25 to a standstill over four days.<br><br>At Southwark Crown Court Judge Christopher Hehir sentenced the group&#x27;s &quot;ideas man&quot; Roger Hallam to five years in jail, while Daniel Shaw, 38, Louise Lancaster, 58, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, and Cressida Gethin, 22, each received four-year jail terms.<br><br>The story had begun almost two years ago when a concerned whistleblower from JSO contacted me, prompted by a genuine fear that lives were at stake. Arrangements were made for me to infiltrate a closely guarded JSO meeting at which I listened in amazement and horror as plans were set out to bring the M25 to a halt.<br><br>Around a dozen people on the web call nodded along, then a voice boomed out: &quot;We need to squash the evil — and what that involves is closing motorways. It&#x27;s almost impossible to stop and causes massive disruption.&quot;</p>

    <p>Then Hallam appeared on screen – a 58-year-old organic farmer who is credited with co-founding JSO. Sitting in his ground-floor flat in South East London, he vowed: &quot;This is not just another action, it&#x27;s potentially the most significant act of civil disobedience in decades. If it goes on for three or four days it is the biggest disruption in British history.&quot;<br><br>The plan was for protesters to climb the steel gantries over the M25, which would make police stop the traffic out of safety concerns. Giggling, Hallam told followers: &quot;We need to get on to the gantries — there&#x27;s thousands of them.&quot;<br><br>In his audience was Cambridge University student Cressida &quot;Cressy&quot; Gethin who said: &quot;This disruption is going to be even more showstopping.&quot; Fellow defendants Shaw, a social worker, ex-teacher Lancaster and key activist Whittaker De Abreu all spoke on the call.<br><br>However it still caused mayhem, costing the Met more than £1.1million, with damage to the economy put at £765,000. It caused people to miss cancer appointments, flights and funerals.</p>
