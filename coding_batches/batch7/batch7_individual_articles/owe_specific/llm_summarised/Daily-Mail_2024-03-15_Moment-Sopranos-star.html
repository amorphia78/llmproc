    <p>This is the wild moment Sopranos actor Michael Imperioli shoved climate change activists out of the theatre midway through his Broadway performance of An Enemy of the People.<br><br>On Thursday night, three environmental activists from the group Extinction Rebellion halted the show by shouting &#x27;no theater on dead planet&#x27; during the beginning of the second act.<br><br>One protestor was then seen being escorted out of the theatre by cast members, including Imperioli, who shoved and dragged the rebel up the stairs - all while remaining in character.<br><br>In a video posted on X, formerly know as Twitter, a protestor is seen walking on to the stage while stars Imperioli and Jeremy Strong, who plays Kendall Roy on succession, were in the middle of performing a rather tense scene.<br><br>&#x27;I am very, very sorry to interrupt your night and this amazing performance. I am a theater artist,&#x27; the rebel shouted before being escorted offstage by security.</p>

    <p>The protestor continued: &#x27;The oceans are rising. It will swallow this city and this entire theater whole. I am putting my career on the line because we are not doing anything about this crisis. The water is coming for us!&#x27;<br><br>&#x27;Go back drama school!&#x27; Imperioli yelled in true gangster fashion.<br><br>Strong, still in character retorted loudly &#x27;let them speak.&#x27;<br><br>Imperioli then left the stage and helped to shove the activist up the stairs and out of the theater.<br><br>Some of the crowd members believed the protestors were part of the show as the plot addresses environmental concerns and involved audience participation.<br><br>When the final activist was kicked out of the theatre, the majority of the room applauded.<br><br>A statement released by the climate change group said: &#x27;Today&#x27;s action highlights the failure of governments and corporations to treat climate and ecological breakdown as the crisis it is.&#x27;</p>
