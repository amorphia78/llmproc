    <p>Greta Thunberg has been taken away by police as they fired a water cannon at demonstrators protesting against fossil fuels in the Netherlands.<br><br>The Swedish climate activist protested alongside members of Extinction Rebellion (XR) as they blocked a busy junction leading onto a motorway in The Hague today.<br><br>Footage shows Thunberg and others being sprayed with water after police deployed a cannon before removing the group of about 50 demonstrators.<br><br>The climate group had planned another protest in The Hague for tomorrow, but cancelled it due to the heavy gusts of wind forecast for the morning.<br><br>XR said in a statement following their blockage: &#x27;The new government&#x27;s plans are not only disastrous for climate policy, but also in many other areas. Whether it concerns asylum and migration, housing or protecting the rights of marginalised groups.&#x27;</p>

    <p>Today&#x27;s protest comes after it was revealed that climate activists in the US and Europe are planning a summer of stunts with demonstrations at airports, banks and the Olympic Games in Paris.<br><br>But Extinction Rebellion, once notorious for shutting down bridges over the Thames River in London, have shifted their main focus from mass civil disobedience to building an inclusive grassroots movement.<br><br>Gail Bradbrook, XR&#x27;s co-founder, told AFP their new-look approach to climate activism strived &#x27;to reach more mainstream folks&#x27; and do &#x27;the deeper work of local organising&#x27;.<br><br>But Gabriella Ditton, a spokesperson for the group, said the arrests hadn&#x27;t deterred them. &#x27;While we face the massive crisis that we are in, we can&#x27;t stop,&#x27; she told AFP.</p>
