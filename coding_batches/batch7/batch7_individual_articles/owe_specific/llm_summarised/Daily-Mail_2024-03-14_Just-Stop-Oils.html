    <p>New footage shows Just Stop Oil&#x27;s pink-haired poster girl being arrested after delivering a letter to Emily Thornberry&#x27;s house.<br><br>Phoebe Plummer, 22, is a prolific protester who has been arrested for a string of disturbances. In March, she was detained on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle and of sending a malicious communication after the Mail exposed an alleged plot to target MPs.<br><br>The privately-educated activist has now been arrested for breaching her bail conditions, with footage showing her walking up to MP Emily Thornberry&#x27;s door. The video posted on social media shows Plummer posting the letter with a friend. It then cuts to show several police officers asking if she has ID.<br><br>An officer then returns, and said: &#x27;We&#x27;ve just spoken to our inspector... you will be under arrest for breaching police bail conditions.&#x27; He then asks if she was aware of the bail conditions not to attend a MP&#x27;s home address.</p>

    <p>Speaking to the camera, she then said: &#x27;So apparently this is the world we live in now. Getting arrested, literally for just posting a letter through to somebody&#x27;s house...somebody&#x27;s front door. That&#x27;s so far from a crime, isn&#x27;t it?&#x27;<br><br>To which the police officer replied: &#x27;You&#x27;ve got these bail conditions for a reason, haven&#x27;t you.&#x27;<br><br>She responded: &#x27;To prevent that. This is what it was trying to prevent. Just delivering a letter.&#x27;<br><br>The video cuts to footage of a police van arriving, and Plummer climbs in before turning and waving, saying: &#x27;See you guys later!&#x27; and laughs.<br><br>Pink-haired Plummer grew up in privilege, raised in a £4million family home near the King&#x27;s Road in Chelsea and privately educated at £45,000-a year St Mary&#x27;s School in Ascot, Berkshire, then £34,000-a-year Mander Portman Woodward College in Kensington, west London.</p>
