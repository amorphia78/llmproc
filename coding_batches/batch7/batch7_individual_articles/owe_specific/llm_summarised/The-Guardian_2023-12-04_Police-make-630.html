        <h1>Police make 630 arrests of climate protesters in London in one month</h1><p>Liberty condemns &#x27;staggering and shocking&#x27; statistic as anti-protest legislation is enacted<br><br>Police have made at least 630 arrests of peaceful protesters campaigning against new oil and gas production in the past month, as the authorities exploit new powers under the government&#x27;s anti-protest legislation.<br><br>The mass arrests of more than 470 people – some individuals were arrested more than once – was condemned by civil rights group Liberty as &quot;staggering and shocking&quot;.<br><br>The protests involve slow marching along roads and are a form of peaceful civil resistance, says Just Stop Oil. The protests over the past four weeks coincided with the British government confirming in the king&#x27;s speech its plans to grant new North Sea oil and gas licences every year.<br><br>Police are using new powers to make the mass arrests under section 7 of the Conservative government&#x27;s Public Order Act 2023, which bans any action that &quot;interferes with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure&quot;. According to data gathered by Just Stop Oil, almost half of the arrests were carried out under section 7. The offence carries a prison sentence of up to 12 months.</p>

    <p>Evidence reveals some people have been held in police custody for long periods after arrest. A 23-year-old was arrested within five minutes of joining a demonstration and held for 56 hours in custody. A 19-year-old student was held for three nights in a London prison despite being given bail by a magistrates court. Another 19-year-old student was held for 50 hours in a London police cell.<br><br>Jun Pang, a policy and campaigns officer for Liberty, said: &quot;The staggering number of people arrested in recent weeks shows just how sweeping and dangerous these powers are. It&#x27;s shocking to see hundreds of young protesters criminalised simply for standing up for what they believe in.&quot;<br><br>Just Stop Oil said: &quot;They&#x27;re imprisoning peaceful protesters, protecting the real criminals, and licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects while everything burns.&quot;</p></body></html>
