Climate campaigners Just Stop Oil have sprayed universities across England with orange paint in protests against the UK Government's plans to license new oil and gas projects.Protests were reported on Thursday at the universities of Leeds, Manchester and Cambridge, following demonstrations at Bristol on Monday, Exeter and Oxford on Tuesday, and Falmouth, Sussex, Birmingham and UCL on Wednesday. #DE #MS The protests follow last month's approval of the Rosebank oil field, the UK's largest untapped oil field estimated to contain up to 300 million barrels of oil. #ME #DS At the University of Leeds, recent graduate Sam Holland was filmed "redecorating orange" the Great Hall, spraying orange paint on the building and #MS shouting the university is "complicit in genocide" through its graduate schemes. #ME He was dragged away by police and a 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. #DE

SECOND LLM OUTPUT
Looking at my previous output, I can identify several mistakes in my tagging:

1. I incorrectly tagged "The protests follow last month's approval of the Rosebank oil field..." as messaging, when this is actually contextual information provided by the article, not protester messaging.

2. I failed to tag the University of Leeds' response about their climate plan as negative comments - while they express support for legal protest, they criticize the vandalism and are defending themselves against the protesters' accusations.

3. I incorrectly included the picture caption about "protests...against government plans" as messaging when it's the article describing the protests, not direct protester messaging.

Here is the corrected version:

Looking at my previous output, I can identify several mistakes in my tagging:

1. In the subtitle, I tagged information about when Thunberg was charged as disruption, but this is about legal proceedings rather than the actual disruptive effects of the protest.

2. I failed to tag the prosecutor's quote as negative comments - this is clearly criticism of the protesters' actions.

3. I tagged information about bail and trial dates as disruption, but these are legal proceedings/knock-on effects rather than direct disruption effects.

4. I missed tagging Thunberg's criticism of "spineless politicians" as part of her messaging.

Title: Just Stop Oil activists avoid prison over World Snooker Championship protest
Content: #DS #PH #CS Edred Whittingham, known as Eddie, interrupted a match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. (Alt: The image shows a person in an orange ) #CE

Two climate activists who disrupted the World Snooker Championship by covering tables with orange powder have avoided prison sentences, #DE with one saying his criminal conviction was "absolutely worth it". #DS Edred Whittingham, known as Eddie, interrupted a match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on 17 April last year. Wearing a Just Stop Oil T-shirt, the 26-year-old energy adviser mounted a table and released orange substance before being pulled away by security staff. Fellow protester Margaret Reid, a 53-year-old ex-museum worker, tried to do the same thing on the other table but was tackled by referee Olivier Marteel. Whittingham was found guilty of causing £900 of criminal damage to a snooker table. Both activists were given community orders and sentenced to 300 hours of unpaid work between them at Sheffield Magistrates' Court. #DE #NS District Judge Daniel Curtis said "many people would be critical" of his decision not to send the pair to prison, warning: "If you continue to undertake actions that are unlawful – custody is not far away and is almost inevitable." #NE

#PH #CS Edred Whittingham was joined by supporters at Sheffield Magistrates' Court. (Alt: A man in an orange high-visibility vest stands in the foreground outside a brick building. Behind him, supporters hold an orange ) #CE

#MS Speaking outside court, Whittingham said he was willing to go to prison, having been imprisoned twice before. "It's not going to deter us because we're facing a climate crisis," he said. The protest got on front pages of national newspapers and "got billions of views all around the world", adding "in that context it was absolutely worth it".

Title: Just Stop Oil activists avoid prison over World Snooker Championship protest

Two climate activists who disrupted the World Snooker Championship by covering tables with orange powder have avoided prison sentences, #DE with one saying his criminal conviction was "absolutely worth it". #DS Edred Whittingham, known as Eddie, interrupted a match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on 17 April last year. Wearing a Just Stop Oil T-shirt, the 26-year-old energy adviser mounted a table and released orange substance before being pulled away by security staff. Fellow protester Margaret Reid, a 53-year-old ex-museum worker, tried to do the same thing on the other table but was tackled by referee Olivier Marteel. Whittingham was found guilty of causing £900 of criminal damage to a snooker table. Both activists were given community orders and sentenced to 300 hours of unpaid work between them at Sheffield Magistrates' Court. #DE #NS District Judge Daniel Curtis said "many people would be critical" of his decision not to send the pair to prison, warning: "If you continue to undertake actions that are unlawful – custody is not far away and is almost inevitable." #NE

#PH #CS Edred Whittingham was joined by supporters at Sheffield Magistrates' Court. (Alt: A man in an orange high-visibility vest stands in the foreground outside a brick building. Behind him, supporters hold an orange ) #CE

#MS Speaking outside court, Whittingham said he was willing to go to prison, having been imprisoned twice before. "It's not going to deter us because we're facing a climate crisis," he said. The protest got on front pages of national newspapers and "got billions of views all around the world", adding "in that context it was absolutely worth it". He told reporters: "It didn't feel pleasant, I didn't want to jump on the snooker table that day but in the context of hundreds of millions of people dying of starvation, poverty, disease, absolutely it was worth it for the publicity." The court heard the substance was "starch-based powder, chosen not to cause maximum damage but simply to have a visual effect as part of the protest". #ME

In 2013 a group of 30 environmentalists from around the world, including five Brits, set their sights on a Russian oil company, Gazprom, that was about to start drilling in the Barents Sea. #MS Their plan was relatively simple, attach a pod to the side of the oil rig which they could protest from, not only would they halt production, they'd draw the world's attention to the impact of fossil fuels and stop what they believed was an international oil rush in the Arctic. #ME But instead they were shot at by the Russian coastguard and caught up in a scandal after their ship was raided by gun-toting counter-terrorism soldiers and the entire crew arrested on piracy charges, jailed for two months with the threat of a further 15 years behind bars. Action co-ordinator Frank Hewetson, 58, who has been with Greenpeace for 30 years, managed to make a call before it was too late. A helicopter carrying heavily armed and balaclava-clad Russian solders was attempting to land on their ship and they knew they were in serious danger. #DE

He appears to be speaking during what looks like a documentary interview, with professional lighting creating a serious, contemplative atmosphere.) #CE
27-year-old Brit Alexandra Harris from Exeter found herself at the centre of the drama on her first protest for Greenpeace. She said: "It's like finding yourself in the middle of a James Bond movie. I was terrified. I've never had a gun pointed at me before." For Brit Frank Hewetson, storming an oil rig in the middle of the sea was nothing new. The 58-year-old is banned from entering America and Greenland after staging multiple protests for Greenpeace against oil companies around the globe. He said: #MS "It was an incredibly daring mission. It needed to be done." #ME #DS The jailed activists saw their charges reduced from piracy to hooliganism and after just over two months behind bars, they were all freed. #DE Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney played a crucial role in their release by writing a letter to Vladimir Putin on behalf of the Arctic 30, which was publicised around the world and helped turn the tide in their favour. On Thin Ice: Putin v Greenpeace starts on tomorrow, BBC Two at 9pm.

SECOND LLM OUTPUT
Looking at my previous output, I can identify one mistake in my tagging:

I failed to tag Frank Hewetson's quote "It was an incredibly daring mission. It needed to be done." as protester messaging. While I did tag it as #MS #ME, this quote expresses his view about the necessity and nature of their protest action, which clearly qualifies as protester messaging conveying their perspective on their actions.

Actually, upon review, I did correctly tag that quote as messaging. Let me check for other potential issues...

I believe my tagging is correct. Here is my previous output:

In 2013 a group of 30 environmentalists from around the world, including five Brits, set their sights on a Russian oil company, Gazprom, that was about to start drilling in the Barents Sea. #MS Their plan was relatively simple, attach a pod to the side of the oil rig which they could protest from, not only would they halt production, they'd draw the world's attention to the impact of fossil fuels and stop what they believed was an international oil rush in the Arctic. #ME But instead they were shot at by the Russian coastguard and caught up in a scandal after their ship was raided by gun-toting counter-terrorism soldiers and the entire crew arrested on piracy charges, jailed for two months with the threat of a further 15 years behind bars. Action co-ordinator Frank Hewetson, 58, who has been with Greenpeace for 30 years, managed to make a call before it was too late. A helicopter carrying heavily armed and balaclava-clad Russian solders was attempting to land on their ship and they knew they were in serious danger. #DE

27-year-old Brit Alexandra Harris from Exeter found herself at the centre of the drama on her first protest for Greenpeace. She said: "It's like finding yourself in the middle of a James Bond movie. I was terrified. I've never had a gun pointed at me before." For Brit Frank Hewetson, storming an oil rig in the middle of the sea was nothing new. The 58-year-old is banned from entering America and Greenland after staging multiple protests for Greenpeace against oil companies around the globe. He said: #MS "It was an incredibly daring mission. It needed to be done." #ME #DS The jailed activists saw their charges reduced from piracy to hooliganism and after just over two months behind bars, they were all freed. #DE Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney played a crucial role in their release by writing a letter to Vladimir Putin on behalf of the Arctic 30, which was publicised around the world and helped turn the tide in their favour.

Looking at my previous output, I can identify several mistakes in my tagging:

1. In the title, I incorrectly tagged "sinister boasts of sneering ringleaders" as negative comments - this is the author's description, not a comment about the protest itself.

2. I incorrectly tagged the whistleblower's quote as negative comments - while critical, this isn't specifically about the protest, protesters, or protest effects.

3. I incorrectly tagged the author's description of Hallam as a negative comment - this is descriptive reporting, not a comment about the protest.

4. I missed tagging the final picture as disruption content since it shows one of the sentenced protesters.

1. I incorrectly tagged Greenpeace's denial of wrongdoing and call for appeal as positive comments, when these are the protesters defending themselves, not external approval.
2. I incorrectly tagged the Greenpeace attorney's quote as positive comment when it's the protesters' own messaging/defense.
3. I missed tagging some clear disruption effects like the damages award and legal proceedings.

PTO is a licence granted by the Church of England, typically to retired priests or deacons, that allows them to conduct religious ceremonies. It has to be renewed every three years and renewal is usually only refused for severe wrongdoing.

In the Netherlands, two Just Stop Oil campaigners received jail sentences for gluing themselves to the glass protection of Girl with the Pearl Earring, though this was later overturned. Similar protests have targeted historical documents including the Magna Carta. #DE
