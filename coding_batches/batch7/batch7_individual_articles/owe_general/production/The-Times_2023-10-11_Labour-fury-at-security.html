    <p>Labour is urgently reviewing security arrangements after a protester was able to storm the party’s conference stage and pour glitter over Sir Keir Starmer.<br><br>Yaz Ashmawi, 28, a physicist turned Extinction Rebellion strategist, was arrested after he threw glitter over Starmer as he prepared to give his keynote speech.<br><br>• The key points and policies from Starmer’s speech and Labour conference<br><br>Ashmawi, who was representing the group People Demand Democracy and was wearing a T-shirt bearing its name, ran from the back of the hall to Starmer’s podium.<br><br>The Labour leader pushed Ashmawi — whose full name is Yasine El-Ashmawi — away from the microphone as the protester grabbed Starmer’s shoulder and wrist.<br><br>It took more than ten seconds for security staff to reach the pair. When they did, he was dropped to the floor and dragged away shouting, as Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, angrily said: “For god’s sake.”<br><br>Starmer has described the protester as an “idiot” and said he was “absolutely determined” to ignore him.<br><br>He told Times Radio on Wednesday: “I was absolutely determined that this wasn’t going to disrupt what has been four years of really hard work, getting the Labour Party from where we landed in 2019, which is a very bad place to this last conference before the general election, where we had to set out and did set out our positive case.”<br><br>He said he viewed the speech as a “culminating” moment. “I’ve always seen this as three stages. I took over three and a half years ago, picked it up off the floor. We had to change the party, expose the Tories and SNP as not fit to govern, then setting out the positive case, making the case that this doesn’t have to be another decade of decline.”<br><br>Starmer added: “I was determined we would get on with it. I just wanted to get on with the speech, and that’s why I rolled up my sleeves and got on with it. I didn’t want that idiot to interrupt that.”<br><br>Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, said on Tuesday that she had “never seen Rachel Reeves so angry” and told LBC: “I thought I was going to do a full John Prescott at one point.”<br><br>Prescott, as deputy prime minister in 2001, punched a protester who egged him during a pro-hunting rally in Rhyl.<br><br>A Labour source said that they were “really f***ing angry” over the slow response, adding: “If he had a weapon, Keir could’ve been killed.”<br><br>A senior party source blamed the Metropolitan Police, since Starmer has round-the-clock protection. The Times understands that Met officers were in the hall during his speech as well as security staff provided by the venue, ACC Liverpool.<br><br>The Met said that it did not comment on security matters. ACC Liverpool said that “highly trained stewarding and security teams ensured the incident was dealt with appropriately”.<br><br>People Demand Democracy has been linked to Just Stop Oil and is calling for a proportional voting system for elections and a “House of Citizens” to replace the House of Lords, selected by “democratic lottery”. A Just Stop Oil insider described the group, which was set up this year, as a “coalition member”.<br><br>A representative for People Demand Democracy, who gave her name as Aria, told Times Radio: “We’re rooted in non-violence so the action was designed not to cause harm.”<br><br>However, another Labour source said: “Security didn’t work today, for whatever reason, and that’s what we’ll be reviewing with urgency.”<br><br>Graham Wettone, a former Metropolitan Police officer, said: “Anyone who gets that close is clearly a breach in security. The risk and danger depends on a number of things. Clearly, there has been a breach of security.<br><br>“But you can’t have security standing right alongside Starmer and his protection officers acted quite quickly. It comes down to how closely you want your security. It depends on what your principal wants from you, balanced with an assessment of the threat.<br><br>“The action from the cops looks fairly reasonable to me and they dealt with him quickly and reasonably. But it’s a breach of the venue’s security and questions must be asked about how the protester was able to get onto the stage.”<br><br>Those attending the conference have to have a conference pass, issued after an accreditation process, and any bags have to be scanned or searched. The security arrangements are relatively light compared with the airport-style scanners in place at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.<br><br>A Labour spokesman said that Starmer was “fine” and “completely unfazed”. While cameras broadcasting the speech were cut as the incident unfolded, Starmer remained on stage while the man was removed. Carol Linforth, a veteran Labour staff member and the party’s director of events, helped Starmer to remove his jacket.<br><br>Starmer told members, who got to their feet to cheer and applaud: “If he thinks that bothers me, he doesn’t know me. Protest or power, that’s why we’ve changed our party, conference.”</p>

    <p>After the speech Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said that Labour was a “party of power, not protest”. She told BBC News: “It just shows, doesn’t it, that you can’t bother Keir Starmer with stuff like that. It’s about power not protest, that is what Keir Starmer was talking about. We’re a party of power not protest.”<br><br>Last month, People Demand Democracy gave Starmer and Rishi Sunak an ultimatum to implement its demands by September 30 or face “proportionate action”.<br><br>Ashmawi, who goes by the alias “Dove”, is from Surrey and holds two master’s degrees in theoretical physics, one from the University of St Andrews and the other from the University of Cambridge.<br><br>He attended primary school in Oxted, Surrey, before moving to Dubai and studying at Dubai College, one of the Middle East’s leading private schools which charges more than £24,000 a year.<br><br>After working as a web designer, videographer and photographer, he joined Extinction Rebellion full-time as a member of the group’s strategy team.<br><br>He has previously been at the forefront of XR’s protests and in one case led protesters in a march along the River Clyde in Glasgow during Cop 26. This year he told Yahoo News UK that XR had changed and that it was “not just blocking random junctions any more” and instead “coming to the centre of power”.<br><br>The ACC Liverpool group, which runs the venue where Labour is holding its annual conference, said it “recognises the rights of all groups and individuals to free speech and freedom of expression” but said the safety of its speakers and customers was of the “utmost importance”.<br><br>Shabana Mahmood, the shadow justice minister, told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme: “I’m sure questions are being asked. We will want to make sure that nothing like that can ever happen again.”<br><br>A spokesman for Merseyside police said that Ashmawi had been arrested on suspicion of a section 39 assault, breach of the peace and causing public nuisance, and would be questioned.<br><br>At 1.20pm, everything was going to plan for Labour’s PR machine (James Glossop, Times photographer, writes). A crowd of jolly placard-wielding activists was assembled to cheer as Sir Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria walked towards a dozen or so photographers and a TV crew. This was the early picture, provided to use before the speech begins to satisfy any publications with early deadlines. It also takes place in somewhere with a bit of natural light, not something that is in abundance at party conferences.<br><br>Forty-five minutes later, things were no longer going to plan. A protester strode on to the stage in Liverpool before Starmer had even started his speech, and threw glitter all over him. This is the kind of thing we photographers need to be ready for. Although the protester’s message wasn’t particularly clear and the subsequent reporting of the speech mentioned the incident only as a side-note, I would bet that it will be the main image from the speech used in most newspapers on Wednesday morning.<br><br>Shooting a political speech is all about reading the mood of the room, weighing up where the good backgrounds are and paying attention. The most important moments to pay attention are during the first five minutes and the last five minutes. This is when ordinarily wooden politicians may start getting animated and waving to no one in particular, hugging their colleagues, gesturing to the crowd, that kind of thing. Which all make better pictures than a talking head. Had the protest happened in the middle of the speech, it may have been missed by quite a few photographers.<br><br>I decided to shoot from the back of the room, on a TV platform I probably wasn’t supposed to be on, using my 100-400mm lens at 400mm. The platform allows enough height to get clear of the audience when they stand to applaud at the beginning. It’s normally sensible to keep “on” the speaker until the cadence of their speech shifts into a more regular rhythm, and they start moving through each of the many topics they feel obliged to cover.<br><br>After this had happened there really was no point in shooting any of the standard “man points while looking serious” type pictures, so I rushed back to the laptop to file the glitter images before the paper’s important afternoon meeting, also called “conference”. One of the set held the front of our website for several hours.<br><br>I was wondering after the event if the police or party security would be in trouble for not reacting quickly enough. Starmer’s reaction in the sequence of images shows what I read to be a certain amount of disbelief at what was happening, or at least that it took seemingly so long for someone to intervene. Labour are odds on by quite a margin to win the next election. Whether they win or not, my guess is that security will be quite a bit tighter at next year’s conference.</p>
