    <p>“We demand that our government stops the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030 and that they support and finance other countries to make a fast, fair and just transition.”<br><br>Ch Supt Ian Howells, who led the operation, said: “We know Just Stop Oil are planning to disrupt airports across the country this summer which is why we have taken swift and robust action now Our stance is very clear that anyone who compromises the safety and security of airports in London can expect a strong response from officers or security staff.<br><br>“Airports are complex operating environments which is why we are working closely with them, agencies and other partners on this operation.”<br><br>All those released on bail are subject to conditions, which include not travelling within 1km of any UK airport unless passing through by vehicle or on public transport. Anyone suspected of breaching this condition can be arrested immediately.</p></body></html>
