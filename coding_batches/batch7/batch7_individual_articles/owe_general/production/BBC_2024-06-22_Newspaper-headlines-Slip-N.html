    <p>West of England newspapers have been dominated by coverage of Glastonbury Festival preparations and the Stonehenge controversy this week.<br><br>Just Stop Oil campaigners sprayed Stonehenge with orange paint on Wednesday, the day before the Summer Solstice. Bristol Live reported how members of the public tried to intervene during the incident near Salisbury. The Swindon Advertiser covered both the protest and the successful paint removal the following day, noting that a &quot;specialist handheld blower&quot; was used to clean the orange cornflour paint from the ancient monument.<br><br>The Wiltshire Times reported that King Arthur Pendragon, a senior druid and pagan priest, disapproved of the protest action. However, this did not diminish Friday&#x27;s Summer Solstice celebrations, where around 15,000 people from &quot;every single continent&quot; gathered at Stonehenge to watch the sunrise. The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald noted that one group dressed as Mexican mushrooms took nine days to travel to the site.<br><br>Glastonbury Festival coverage intensified as Somerset Live monitored weather reports ahead of the event. Content editor Daniel Clark reported on Great Western Railway&#x27;s &#x27;Shania Train&#x27; that will transport thousands of festival-goers to Castle Cary station. The Somerset Gazette shared a special &quot;star filled&quot; photograph inspired by the festival&#x27;s Pyramid Stage, while a tribute film for Wilf &#x27;the egg man&#x27; Peddle by Tor Theatre appeared on the Normal For Glastonbury Facebook page.</p>
