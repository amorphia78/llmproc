    <p>Just Stop Oil activists are appealing to the United Nations to support their &quot;human right to protest&quot; against new UK legislation they claim violates international conventions. The group&#x27;s prominent member, 22-year-old Phoebe Plummer, faces the first trial under Section 7 of the Public Order Act in May, which allows authorities to jail convicted protesters for up to a year or impose fines for interfering with key national infrastructure.<br><br>Plummer is urging fellow activists to sign a complaint to UN human rights advisor Michel Forst, arguing that &quot;Sec 7 is a new law disproportionately restricting our human right to protest&quot; and claiming there is &quot;a strong case that this places the UK in breach of UN conventions.&quot; She emphasized the urgency, stating that adding names to the complaint &quot;could be a huge help in your defence when you go to trial.&quot;<br><br>Police have actively used the new law since last year, including arresting 65 Just Stop Oil activists in October for slow-marching in Parliament Square. The legislation is part of a broader European crackdown on climate protests, with France and Germany adopting anti-terror approaches to some demonstrations.</p>

    <p>Activists plan to cite the UN&#x27;s Aarhus Convention, signed by the UK in 2001, which grants environmental rights including &quot;public participation and access to justice,&quot; though its legal force remains unclear as it&#x27;s not incorporated into UK law.<br><br>UN Special Rapporteur Michel Forst has expressed concern over these &quot;regressive&quot; new laws, noting in January that &quot;it had been almost unheard of since the 1930s for the public to be imprisoned for peaceful protest in the UK.&quot;<br><br>However, the Home Office defended the legislation, stating: &quot;The right to protest is a fundamental part of democracy but must be balanced with protecting the law-abiding majority&#x27;s right to go about their lives, free from disruption.&quot;</p></body></html>
