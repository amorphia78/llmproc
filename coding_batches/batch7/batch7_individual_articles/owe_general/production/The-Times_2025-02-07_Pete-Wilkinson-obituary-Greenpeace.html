    <p>Pete Wilkinson was Greenpeace UK&#x27;s first director and a pioneering environmental activist who helped create the blueprint for modern climate activism. A working-class campaigner from Deptford, Wilkinson was recruited in 1977 by Greenpeace founder David McTaggart, who had asked for &quot;the most ornery sonofabitch&quot; from Friends of the Earth.<br><br>As campaign director for over a decade, Wilkinson proved a persistent thorn in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s side, organizing dramatic protests including sailing inflatables below British nuclear waste dumping rigs, chasing Japanese whalers, and scaling Big Ben in 1984. His meticulous planning generated maximum publicity - &quot;When we tell the press that we&#x27;re going to do something, they know that it&#x27;s going to be effective and they know it&#x27;s going to be dramatic,&quot; he said.<br><br>Wilkinson&#x27;s crowning achievement was helping prevent mineral exploitation in Antarctica. Leading six expeditions from 1985, he established the first year-round Antarctic protest base on Ross Island. His team &quot;lived on adrenaline and played hard&quot; during the volatile polar conditions. This persistent campaign contributed to the 1991 treaty designating Antarctica a &quot;World Park&quot; with a 50-year mining moratorium that still stands today.</p>

A smiling man in a checkered shirt stands next to the tall stone structure, which has a commemorative plaque mounted on it. The scene appears to be at a dock or shipyard, with wooden crates, rigging equipment, and what looks like the Sydney Opera House visible in the background across the water." width="100%">

    <p>Early victories included disrupting the 1978 International Whaling Commission conference and preventing a seal cull around Orkney Islands, which gained worldwide media attention and established Greenpeace as &quot;box office&quot; news. By the 1980s, they owned three ships and had 30,000 British supporters.<br><br>Wilkinson&#x27;s activism was motivated by anger at environmental destruction: &quot;I don&#x27;t like to see what is essentially a very unique and beautiful thing being polluted and destroyed.&quot; His relationship with police he dismissed as &quot;good-natured competition,&quot; claiming officers privately supported their cause.<br><br>After leaving Greenpeace, funding challenges meant he worked at Asda and drove school buses while continuing evening campaigns, latterly fighting the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power station.<br><br>Pete Wilkinson died of a suspected heart attack on January 21, 2025, aged 78</p>

The ship appears to be a substantial maritime vessel with multiple decks, rigging, and communication equipment. The men are dressed casually in jackets and sweaters, with one wearing what appears to be a Greenpeace-related t-shirt. The dock setting and industrial background are clearly visible." width="100%">
