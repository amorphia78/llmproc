    <p>Six people were arrested at a Just Stop Oil meeting in east London on Thursday evening, with Metropolitan Police claiming some were &quot;key organisers&quot; of the climate protest group. The arrests were made under new Public Order Act provisions that make it illegal to conspire to disrupt national infrastructure projects.<br><br>The Met Police stated: &quot;We know Just Stop Oil plan to disrupt airports and thousands of holidaymakers this summer,&quot; and emphasized that &quot;activists do not have the right to commit criminal acts that may also endanger themselves and others.&quot; The force said anyone disrupting airport safety and security &quot;can expect to be dealt with swiftly and robustly,&quot; adding they continue working with airport operators to prevent significant disruption.<br><br>However, Just Stop Oil disputed the police characterization, claiming officers had &quot;raided a soup night.&quot; Video footage posted by the group showed the arrests, including a woman telling officers &quot;I&#x27;ve come here for soup&quot; as she was detained. The group also said another person was arrested while staying with their parents.</p>

    <p>During the arrests, one officer told a handcuffed man: &quot;By taking part in the organisation of this event this evening, I suspect that you are taking part to plot to cause serious disruption to UK airports.&quot;<br><br>The arrests follow recent Just Stop Oil actions, including last week&#x27;s incident at Stansted Airport where two women were charged with criminal damage after spraying private jets with orange paint, allegedly causing over £5,000 in damage. Essex Police confirmed they responded to the incident in the airport&#x27;s private area, though Taylor Swift&#x27;s jet, which Just Stop Oil mentioned had landed &quot;mere hours before,&quot; was not present during the protest.</p></body></html>
