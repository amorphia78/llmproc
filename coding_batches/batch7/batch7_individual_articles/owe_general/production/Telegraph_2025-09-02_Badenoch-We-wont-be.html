    <p>Kemi Badenoch has vowed to take on “bullying” climate change activists after blaming them for halting North Sea oil and gas exploration with legal challenges.<br><br>The Tory leader said the planning system for new fields had “become a paradise for activists and a graveyard for investment”.<br><br>Speaking to oil and gas leaders at a conference in Aberdeen, she said “endless legal challenges” by environmental groups were blocking projects.<br><br>Mrs Badenoch accused Sir Keir Starmer of having “surrendered to the activists” over two of the largest fields in development, Rosebank and Jackdaw.<br><br>But she said a Tory government would ensure “no more judicial overreach” and pledged to introduce a presumption in favour of new fields getting the green light.<br><br>She described Labour’s decision to ban oil and gas licences for new fields as “unilateral economic disarmament dressed up as virtue” and pledged: “Conservatives will not be bullied by activists.”<br><br>Unless more investment is made now, she warned that the UK would be “reliant on imports for more than 80 per cent of oil and gas demand by 2030.”<br><br>Her intervention came after she pledged at the weekend to extract as much oil and gas from the North Sea as possible, arguing that economic growth and the national interest must come before net-zero targets.<br><br>However, a court ruled in January that consent for the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields had been granted unlawfully and their owners must seek fresh approval from the UK Government before production can begin.<br><br>Lord Ericht said a more detailed assessment of the fields’ environmental impact was required, taking into account the effect on the climate of burning any fossil fuels extracted.<br><br>The written judgment on the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields came after a case brought by environmental campaigners, Uplift and Greenpeace, at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. Labour ministers decided not to challenge the judicial review action.<br><br>Shell’s Jackdaw gas field in the North Sea was originally approved by the Conservative government and the industry regulator in the summer 2022.<br><br>Permission for the huge Rosebank oil development, 80 miles west of Shetland in the North Atlantic, was granted in autumn 2023.<br><br>This is the UK’s largest untapped field and Tory ministers argued the move would protect the UK’s energy security during the transition to net zero and create hundreds of jobs.<br><br>Speaking at the SPE Offshore Europe conference, Mrs Badenoch said: “Right now, the regulatory system is strangling the North Sea. We have more lawyers trying to stop oil and gas than rigs producing it.<br><br>“We need to overhaul the planning system for the North Sea because, let’s be honest, it has become a paradise for activists and a graveyard for investment.</p>

    <p>“Endless legal challenges, funded by campaign groups, are blocking the very oil and gas projects we need to keep our economy alive.”<br><br>She said Sir Keir had “no answer” when she challenged him at Prime Minister’s Questions for why the Government had not contested the Rosebank case.<br><br>“Even now, Labour still refuses to commit to granting new licences at all. They are on the wrong side, standing with campaigning lawyers against British workers,” she said.<br><br>“Rosebank and Jackdaw could have powered millions of homes. But Labour dropped the appeal and surrendered to the activists. That was a political choice, and it cost Britain dearly.”<br><br>She pledged this “lawfare” would end with the next Tory government, but warned that without urgent action, 180 out of 280 fields will shut down in the next five years.<br><br>Mrs Badenoch said: “This is not a managed transition. This is collapse. Ed Miliband and Keir Starmer are not planning for decades ahead.<br><br>“We are killing this industry now, and if they succeed, they will not just destroy jobs in Aberdeen, but they will destroy our country’s ability to stand on its own two feet.”<br><br>Michael Shanks, however, a Scottish Labour MP and Energy Minister, used his speech to the conference to deliver a coded attack on her oil and gas policy announcements this week.<br><br>He said: “What drives us is a refusal to accept the status quo of the last decade, let down by a government that talked big but allowed thousands upon thousands of jobs to be lost from this industry and countries to steal a march on winning the jobs of the future.<br><br>“It’s easy to stick a few lines in a political press release and call it policy, but the hard work of stewarding the future of this industry is far too complicated for that.<br><br>“North Sea workers and this community deserve a government that says it’s time to invest in the future and manage this transition in a rational, cooperative way.”<br><br>Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, said: “Kemi may be spending a lot of time reading the lines of Trump and Farage, but what she is clearly not reading is the science or economic advice of experts.<br><br>“North Sea reserves are drying up and what’s left and untapped is barely enough to keep it on life support – lasting no more than a few months or years at current rates of consumption.”<br><br>Also on Tuesday, Ms Badenoch addressed Tory MSP Graham Simpson’s defection to Reform UK.<br><br>She said: “If there are people who join other parties because they think they have a better chance of winning, that means they’re doing this for the wrong reasons.”<br><br>The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, Uplift and Greenpeace were approached for comment.</p></body></html>
