    <p>In 1977 the Canadian activist David McTaggart, on the lookout for someone to help him to set up Greenpeace’s first Europe branch, called an acquaintance at Friends of the Earth and asked for “the most ornery sonofabitch they ever had working for them”. Greenpeace had spun from the Canadian anti-nuclear committee Don’t Make a Wave, which was accustomed to arrests and bloody skirmishes with the authorities. It was not for the lily-livered.<br><br>One name kept cropping up: Pete Wilkinson, known as Wilky or Wilx, a tough, sometimes difficult working-class lad from Deptford with a healthy distrust of authority. He was a born activist — so mutinous that he had had 17 jobs in three years, including as a labourer, curtain seller, lorry driver and encyclopedia hawker, nettling his bosses until his recalcitrance found a home in the emerging world of environmental activism. “I never seem to have been able to keep my opinions to myself very much,” he said simply.<br><br>As campaign director of Greenpeace for more than a decade, Wilkinson helped to create the blueprint for the kind of nonviolent but disruptive and doggedly persistent climate activism we see today. He was at heart a frontline campaigner, and a particularly sharp thorn in the side of Margaret Thatcher’s government — he sailed inflatables directly below British rigs in the Atlantic, off which barrels of nuclear waste were being thrown, chased Japanese whalers across the Southern Ocean and organised a team to scale Big Ben and the Statue of Liberty in 1984 in protest over the US and UK’s refusal to ratify a treaty to ban nuclear weapon tests.<br><br>Wilkinson’s crowning achievement was helping to prevent decades of mineral exploitation in Antarctica. After finally falling foul of the Greenpeace hierarchy in 1985 he was sent to lead the first of six expeditions to the continent to protect its natural resources. The 1959 Antarctic Treaty had banned military activity and nuclear testing but there was no prohibition on drilling, and countries within the treaty, including the UK, were starting to hold secret talks to explore the prospect.<br><br>Setting up a remote camp on Ross Island in the east, the Greenpeace team “lived on adrenaline and played hard”, said Wilkinson. Emotions were volatile during long days without night but they succeeded in setting up a wintering team for the first year-round protest in the Antarctic. Though there was a broad coalition of campaigners fighting the cause, Greenpeace was the only non-governmental organisation to have a presence there and it had access to treaty meetings.<br><br>Wilkinson returned year after year to resupply the base until world leaders signed a treaty in 1991 that designated Antarctica a “World Park”, a concept that had initially been rejected as utopian and implausible. A 50-year moratorium was put in place on mining for oil, gold and other minerals, an agreement that still stands today. It was a remarkable milestone in the history of environmental campaigning because it was preventive rather than reactionary.<br><br>Peter James Wilkinson was born in south London in 1946, the second son of Minnie (née Cremore) and Sidney, an engraver in a bottle factory who had fought with the Desert Rats during the Second World War. He left school in 1962 with few O-levels and little idea of what he wanted to do; an attempt to become an RAF pilot was rejected when they discovered he was colour blind.<br><br>He first came across environmentalism “swilling beer and moaning the plight of people generally” with a lorry-driver friend, who gave him a copy of A Blueprint for Survival by the environmentalist Edward “Teddy” Goldsmith. “I thought you might like to read this, Wilky,” he said. “It’s all about how we’re screwing up the planet and making all the critters suffer as a result of our reprehensible ways.”<br><br>Within days Wilkinson had signed up to volunteer with Friends of the Earth. For five years he organised small-scale protests, including dressing up as a giant water bottle outside a supermarket in Edgware Road, until he fell out with the “toffs” running it and left to join the Post Office as a counter clerk in Somerset. “My ‘career’ was littered with rows with management and short-lived rebellions,” he said, “unable, once again, and however hard I tried, to ‘toe the line’.”<br><br>This particular fight would end when McTaggart phoned and persuaded him against “going straight”. They set up Greenpeace UK from a small office in Whitehall lent to them by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. “We had furious arguments over the years but he had trust in me and let me live a life of derring-do,” Wilkinson recalled. “We only got paid what we would have got on the dole. How we survived the first eight years on a diet of fags, beer and fish and chips I shall never know. But it was fun, a great time to be alive.”</p>

    <p>As Greenpeace UK’s first director, Wilkinson narrowed the focus to three areas — wildlife, nuclear testing and pollution — and planned meticulously to generate maximum publicity. “When we tell the press that we’re going to do something,” he said, “they know that it’s going to be effective and they know it’s going to be dramatic.” Greenpeace’s relationship with the police he dismissed as “good-natured competition”, claiming that an officer at Big Ben had said in private that he supported them.<br><br>One of their first actions was to take over an International Whaling Commission conference in London in 1978 — Wilkinson handed out bouquets of flowers to the astonished delegates — but the turning point for Greenpeace’s reputation as a leader of the green movement came later that year, when it protested against UK government plans to cull half the population of seals around the Orkney Islands to rectify falling fish numbers due to industrial Soviet fishing. As Greenpeace’s representative, Wilkinson spent two weeks on board their flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, which trailed the Norwegian sealer Kvitungen en route to Orkney. The protest gained worldwide media attention, the Kvitungen was sent home and the cull dramatically reduced. After a long night of celebration, Wilkinson gave a drunken interview on BBC Radio 4 in a hotel room. “Pete Wilkinson there, obviously elated and slightly inebriated,” said the anchor after the broadcast. “And who can blame him?”<br><br>The victory ensured that the press followed Greenpeace wherever they went — as one reporter put it, they were “box office”. By the 1980s they owned three ships and had 30,000 supporters in Britain alone. “Even Mrs Thatcher said that she’s worried about the impact the Greenies, as she calls us, are having,” said Wilkinson, who still looked every part the grassroots campaigner with long black hair and a shaggy beard.<br><br>The momentum was briefly punctured in 1985 when a team of French special agents bombed the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbour, New Zealand, where Greenpeace was protesting against French underwater testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific. The ship sank, a freelance photographer called Fernando Pereira was killed and France was ordered to pay Greenpeace $8.1 million in damages. “The initial reaction was that we were stunned, shocked and horrified,” he recalled of the bombing.<br><br>Security was tightened at Greenpeace’s London offices, and the bombing resulted in a surge of support and donations.<br><br>Wilkinson’s particular bugbear was the dumping of nuclear waste and after spotting a marine chart with an area labelled “dumping ground: avoid” in 1983 he began protesting from the reprocessing plant at Sellafield, then called Windscale, in Cumbria, which had rendered the Irish Sea the most radioactive in the world. He defied a High Court injunction to send a team of divers 70ft underwater to cut through the pipes and stuff them with inflatable rubber balls, resulting in a £50,000 fine, which was paid off by public donations.<br><br>During his brief attempt at “going straight” in the Seventies, Wilkinson married Annette Cross but his activism always came first and they later divorced. In 2000 he married Gaye Jerrom, a teacher who survives him along with two daughters, Emily and Amy.<br><br>Wilkinson was an amateur poet, a fan of The Simpsons and a lifelong Millwall FC supporter, but his focus on environmental causes was so intense that most ordinary pursuits, such as social occasions, could seem trivial in comparison. He was motivated by anger, he once said. “I don’t like to see what is essentially a very unique and beautiful thing being polluted and destroyed. I believe that unless we change tack pretty quickly, change is going to come whether we like it or not.”<br><br>After his time at Greenpeace, Wilkinson advised government bodies on handling radioactive waste. His zeal for activism never diminished but the funding did, and by his seventies he was working at Asda and driving a school minibus to make ends meet. In the evenings he campaigned. His last battle was against plans to build a nuclear power station called Sizewell C on his beloved Suffolk coast. Far from his seafaring days, he now became an expert in arcane areas of legal concern, poring over pages of dry planning documentation.<br><br>Yet he always had hopes that he would return to the Antarctic, and in 1996 bought Sir Ranulph Fiennes’s old ship the Benjamin Bowring from a Greek shipowner, with plans to commandeer one final waste-collecting mission. It was not to be. The ship was damaged in a storm and Wilkinson was forced to sell it for scrap to a Turkish breakers yard.<br><br>Pete Wilkinson, environmental activist and first director of Greenpeace UK, was born on November 21, 1946. He died of a suspected heart attack on January 21, 2025, aged 78</p>
