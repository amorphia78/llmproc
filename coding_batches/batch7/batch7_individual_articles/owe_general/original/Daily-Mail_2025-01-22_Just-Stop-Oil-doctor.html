    <p>A NHS doctor who was suspended from her profession for taking part in climate protests with Just Stop Oil eco-zealots has today lost her appeal against the ruling.<br><br>Dr Sarah Benn was slapped with a five-month suspension by a medical practitioners tribunal after the watchdog found her activism had impaired her fitness to practice.<br><br>The &#x27;well-liked&#x27; family GP was jailed for 32 days in 2022 for breaching a court injunction when she took part in a protest outside the Kingsbury Oil Terminal in Warwickshire.<br><br>She was slammed when her suspension order was handed down in April last year for giving &#x27;no acknowledgement that what she has done was wrong&#x27;.<br><br>Now Dr Benn has failed in her appeal at the High Court against the ruling with a judge today throwing out her challenge.<br><br>Dr Benn had taken part in a number of Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil protests, starting in October 2019, and from 2022 has taken part in a series of demonstrations outside the Kingsbury Oil Terminal, in Warwickshire.<br><br>A High Court injunction had banned such protests and she was arrested several times for &#x27;deliberate contravention of the injunction&#x27;.<br><br>It ended up with her being handed a 32 day jail term in September 2022, but despite spending time behind bars she vowed to continue her activism.<br><br>A medical practitioners tribunal, which makes decisions about the fitness to practice of medics in the UK, went on to find her actions had amounted to misconduct and rule that her fitness to practice was impaired because of her climate activism.<br><br>Dr Benn, from Birmingham, West Midlands, claimed her actions were part of a doctor&#x27;s &#x27;fundamental duty is to protect health and life&#x27;.<br><br>But she was handed a five-month suspension from the medical register in April last year.<br><br>She went on to appeal against that ruling to the High Court, relying as part of her evidence on a survey signed by more than 1,000 doctors and other healthcare professionals.<br><br>It showed that &#x27;95% of participants felt that Dr Benn&#x27;s actions did not undermine the public&#x27;s trust in doctors and 96% disagreed with the conclusion that her fitness to practise was impaired&#x27;.<br><br>But Mrs Justice Yip, ruling on the case, today threw out the doctor&#x27;s challenge, saying the medical practitioners tribunal was not wrong to find that Dr Benn&#x27;s continued commitment to potentially illegal climate protest amounted to misconduct.<br><br>The judge said the medical practitioners tribunal&#x27;s finding that they saw Dr Benn&#x27;s &#x27;stated intention to continue to act outside the law as being incompatible with her status as a member of the profession&#x27; could not be legitimately challenged.<br><br>Going on to say that the ruling of misconduct and sanction could not be challenged, the judge concluded: &#x27;The finding that Dr Benn&#x27;s fitness to practise was impaired was not based merely on historical wrongdoing which fell below the standards of personal conduct expected of a doctor, but also took account of Dr Benn&#x27;s stated intention to continue to behave in the same way.</p>

    <p>&#x27;In my judgment, it is not wrong to regard Dr Benn&#x27;s conduct in repeatedly breaching the injunction - to the extent she was imprisoned - and her stated intention to continue to act outside the law as being incompatible with her status as a member of the profession, whatever her motivations for that.<br><br>&#x27;The simple fact is that Dr Benn believes that it is appropriate to continue to take action that is unlawful to draw attention to her very real concerns about climate change. She minimises the impact of her actions on public resourcing.<br><br>&#x27;It was reasonable to allow Dr Benn the opportunity to reflect on the impact of her stated intent to continue her misconduct on her standing as a medical professional.<br><br>&#x27;Accordingly, I agree with the tribunal&#x27;s decision.&#x27;<br><br>Dr Benn ceased active clinical practice in 2022 but has remained on the medical register.<br><br>In a statement after the case,  Charlie Massey, Chief Executive of the GMC, said: &#x27;We note the High Court&#x27;s decision today to dismiss Dr Sarah Benn&#x27;s appeal against the five-month suspension imposed on her by a medical practitioners tribunal.<br><br>&#x27;In a balanced and considered judgment Mrs Justice Yip found that Dr Benn&#x27;s conduct did amount to misconduct and emphasised that it was this conduct, not her beliefs, that had brought her before a medical practitioners tribunal. The judgment concluded that in finding her fitness to practise impaired the tribunal had based their decision not merely on Dr Benn&#x27;s actions - which fell below the standards of personal conduct expected of a doctor - but also on her intention to continue breaking the law. The judge also agreed that a doctor&#x27;s status as a trusted professional is called into question if they not only break the law but refuse to be bound by the law.<br><br>&#x27;We agree that climate change is one of the greatest threats facing us all, particularly given the serious threat a changing climate poses to human health and wellbeing. Our guidance is clear that doctors, like all citizens, have a right to express their personal opinions on important issues like climate change, and there is nothing in our guidance that prevents them from exercising their right to lobby government and campaign - including taking part in protests. Our recently updated professional standards for all UK doctors, Good medical practice, also includes a new sustainability commitment, with a specific duty that all doctors should choose sustainable solutions.<br><br>&#x27;However, patients and the public have a high degree of trust in doctors, and that trust can be put at risk when doctors fail to comply with the law.&#x27;</p>
