        <h1>Sir John Jennings obituary: Chairman of Shell during Brent Spar controversy</h1><h2>Leading figure credited with making the company greener who told the oil industry it had to listen to the public</h2><p>At the 1996 annual meeting of Shell Transport and Trading the chairman, John Jennings, called for a minute’s silence “to pause for quiet reflection in the spirit of reconciliation”. It was six months after worldwide outrage at the execution of the author Ken Saro-Wiwa and nine other Ogoni activists on the orders of the Nigerian president, Sani Abacha. They had been protesting against Shell’s pollution of the Niger Delta, but were found guilty of arranging the deaths of four pro-government Ogoni leaders. Another 19 rebels, then on death row, were not released until after Abacha died in 1998.<br><br>The tension in the room at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on London’s South Bank was matched outside, where 200 demonstrators banged African drums and waved banners demanding “Get the Shell out of Nigeria”.<br><br>During his four years as chairman, Jennings had become used to regular disruption by environmental, human rights and anti-apartheid groups, and had learnt from painful experience how to take the heat out of difficult situations. He told a petroleum conference that the oil industry had to learn to listen to the public, acknowledge their fears and concerns, and make its case “with persuasive imagery in an acceptable and media-friendly manner”. He added: “Cold facts alone are not enough.”<br><br>Jennings believed that, like ice skaters, the industry would be scored separately for technical content and presentation, and would succeed only if it performed well in both. The 1995 Brent Spar oil storage buoy controversy had delivered harsh lessons. After months of hostile media coverage, Shell had been forced by the environmental pressure group Greenpeace to withdraw plans for sinking the redundant buoy in the Atlantic, even though this was agreed to be the most practical solution, and it had been pumped clean years before. But that took no account of the political furore, in which the company was condemned by several European governments. Even worse, from Jennings’s point of view, his U-turn left John Major, the UK prime minister, looking foolish for having supported Shell in the House of Commons and at a G7 summit. Jennings wrote to Major, regretting “the position in which the outcome of this complex issue placed you and your ministerial colleagues”. Major was understood to be furious.<br><br>The Times said in 1997: “At its very heart, Shell is a compromise, run by a committee of managing directors, a marriage of hard-nosed Dutch engineers and wheeling and dealing British accountants.” The Brent Spar and Saro-Wiwa episodes clearly prompted a main rethink by that committee, of which Jennings was a prominent member. One of his colleagues, Cornelius Herkströter, said: “We were somewhat slow in understanding that these [environmental and consumer] groups were tending to acquire authority.”<br><br>Jennings made valuable contributions to Shell’s green credentials, improving deep-water drilling techniques and biomass technologies to enable lower-carbon energy. In an exchange of letters in the Financial Times with the Body Shop founder, Anita Roddick, he said: “Shell has just completed an important global exercise in listening to people from both inside and outside the company; 14 round-table conferences with more than 300 people from 53 countries engaged in a dialogue about society’s changing expectations of multinationals. This is not a PR exercise but rather a transparent attempt to find out what people really want from all big corporations, not just Shell. I am not pretending it is easy to satisfy the often conflicting expectations which people have of major companies. Rather, a central plank in the dialogue is for everyone concerned to participate in finding a way to a resolution.”</p>

    <p>John Southwood Jennings was born in Oldbury, Worcestershire (now West Midlands), in 1937, the son of George Jennings, an electrician, and his wife Irene (née Bartlett). An only child, he was apparently not close to his parents. When he arrived home from school eager to tell his mother he had come second in class at the end of term, Irene replied: “Why not first?”<br><br>He attended Oldbury grammar school, now Langley High, and read geology at the University of Birmingham. A Shell research scholarship at the University of Edinburgh enabled him to obtain a PhD before joining the company in 1961. He later became a Sloan fellow at London Business School.<br><br>In 1961 Jennings married Gloria Griffiths. They had a daughter, Susan, who lives in France, and a son, Iain, who worked in the oil industry and died in 2023 of complications from dementia. The marriage was dissolved in 1996. The following year he married Linda Baston (née Zetter), who had worked for him in the chairman’s office. Linda and Susan survive him.<br><br>Shell first sent him to Oman as a well-site geologist, where he helped to find that country’s first oil reserves. Within seven years he became chief geologist for Shell UK Exploration and Production. He returned to Oman as exploration manager of Petroleum Development Oman, then Shell’s general manager in Turkey. From 1979 he had executive roles in London and the Hague before being promoted to managing director of Royal Dutch Shell Group in 1987 and chairman of the UK arm, Shell Transport and Trading, from 1993.<br><br>After leaving Shell, Jennings became a non-executive director of Intelligent Energy, Apple Oil &amp; Gas, the investment bank Robert Fleming Holdings and the Norwegian certification firm Det Norske Veritas, along with other charitable and educational roles. In 1985 he was appointed CBE, four years later becoming Commandeur de l’Ordre National du Mérite (Gabon), and was knighted in 1997.<br><br>Jennings and Linda bought and demolished a house near Exmouth in Devon, commissioning the classical architect William Bertram to design and build an elegant replacement while they lived in the staff cottages. “We had no intention of knocking it down when we bought it,” Jennings said, “but the electrics and plumbing were the pits.” They later moved to Guernsey.<br><br>He enjoyed flyfishing and shooting, until recently travelling annually to Alaska to hunt salmon, and maintained his fondness for geology. “He was never happier than when he was in the desert somewhere, digging up rocks, getting his hands dirty,” said Linda.<br><br>Sir John Jennings, businessman, was born on March 30, 1937. He died on August 29, 2024, aged 87</p></body></html>
