        <h1>Prevent: Rise in climate activists referred to anti-terror scheme</h1><p>The number of climate activists referred to the UK&#x27;s Prevent anti-terrorism programme has increased following the emergence of disruptive environmental protests, the BBC has learned. The scheme aims to stop people becoming terrorists, with institutions including schools and universities having a legal duty since 2015 to consider radicalisation risks.<br><br>Between 2015 and 2022, there were 32 Prevent referrals for &quot;Left Wing - Environmental&quot; reasons, with a notable spike in 2019 when Extinction Rebellion gained prominence. The BBC spoke to one climate activist who was referred to Prevent by their employer after being arrested at an Extinction Rebellion protest, though no further action was taken after assessment.<br><br>Critics argue Prevent curbs human rights by stifling non-violent political beliefs. Sir Peter Fahy, former national police lead for Prevent, said it was &quot;inappropriate&quot; to treat non-violent climate activists as potential terrorists, arguing the rise in environmental cases &quot;shows how confused we&#x27;ve become about all of this.&quot; Amnesty International&#x27;s Ilyas Nagdee said &quot;people are being referred to Prevent for non-violent political beliefs.&quot;</p>

    <p>Climate activists say the government&#x27;s definition of extremism is too broad, confusing extremism with non-violent civil disobedience. Mat Osmond, a university lecturer involved in climate activism, distinguished between &quot;being drawn into violent extremism&quot; and &quot;taking action with non-violent resistance campaigns.&quot;<br><br>However, the Home Office maintains that Prevent interventions are legitimate for those who could be radicalised into terrorism for environmental causes, stating there have been &quot;a small number of instances of terrorist behaviour motivated by an environmentalist ideology.&quot; Lord Carlile, who reviewed the scheme in 2011, said environmental protesters who &quot;presented as potentially violent extremists are properly referable to Prevent.&quot;<br><br>The government insists it has never advised referring people for lawful climate activism, with a spokesperson stating that &quot;lawful protest or activism does not meet the threshold for Prevent referrals.&quot;</p></body></html>
