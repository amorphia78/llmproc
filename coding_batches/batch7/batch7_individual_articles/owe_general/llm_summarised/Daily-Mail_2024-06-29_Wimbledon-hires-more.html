    <p>Wimbledon is implementing its largest security operation ever as it prepares for potential protests from environmental and pro-Palestinian activists during this year&#x27;s championships. More than 1,000 security guards, supported by specialist police spotters, will monitor the tournament to prevent disruptions.<br><br>The Palestine Solidarity Campaign has hundreds of activists planning to target the tournament, while Just Stop Oil has announced intentions to disrupt play, following their actions last year that affected two matches. During one incident, Britain&#x27;s No 1 Katie Boulter had her match paused when a protester scattered jigsaw puzzle pieces and orange confetti across the court, leaving her shocked by the interruption.<br><br>In response to last year&#x27;s protest tactics, the All-England Club has removed jigsaw puzzles of Centre Court and scoreboards from their official shops to prevent similar disruptions. A Metropolitan Police spokesman warned protesters to expect rapid response to any attempts at causing disturbances.</p>

    <p>Beyond security concerns, players are focusing on their upcoming matches and other distractions. Boulter expressed worry about losing sleep if England progresses in the Euros, anticipating loud celebrations from nearby pubs. Emma Raducanu acknowledged enjoying football festivities but remains focused on her challenging first-round match against 22nd-seeded Russian Ekaterina Alexandrova, describing herself as the underdog due to her opponent&#x27;s experience and higher ranking.<br><br>Meanwhile, Andy Murray appeared optimistic during practice sessions just one week after back surgery. The 37-year-old two-time Wimbledon champion hopes to compete in what may be his farewell tournament before retirement. He&#x27;s scheduled to face world No 38 Tomas Machac on Tuesday and plans to play doubles with brother Jamie, though he admitted uncertainty about his recovery, stating he cannot yet move properly and needs 48 hours to assess his condition.</p>
