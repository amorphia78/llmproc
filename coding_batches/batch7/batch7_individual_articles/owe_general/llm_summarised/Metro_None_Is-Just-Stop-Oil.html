Behind them, a dramatic scene unfolds with bright orange flames and smoke creating an intense backdrop against the historic architecture. The individuals appear to be wearing dark clothing, and the lighting from the fire illuminates the ornate carved stonework of what appears to be a cathedral or similar religious building." width="100%">

    <p>After three years of disruptive protests including blocking roads and spraying Stonehenge with orange powder, Just Stop Oil is ending its direct action campaign, claiming to be &quot;one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history.&quot;<br><br>JSO activists defend their approach, with charity worker Stephanie explaining their evolution from blocking oil terminals to sabotaging petrol stations made strategic sense. Another activist, Olivia, joined after feeling JSO &quot;had a plan&quot; when Extinction Rebellion seemed lost. Despite the fear of facing angry drivers, she felt &quot;this is what I need to be doing.&quot;<br><br>The group achieved remarkable awareness, with over 90% of Brits knowing they existed within months. Sam Nadel from the Social Change Lab notes that &quot;even when you&#x27;re getting media coverage that&#x27;s incredibly negative,&quot; media outlets &quot;have no choice but to include your demand.&quot; JSO can claim partial victory with the government&#x27;s ban on new North Sea drilling.<br><br>However, the campaign faced significant opposition. Some 64% of the British public hold unfavorable views of JSO, and the Conservative government responded with harsh new laws, increasing highway obstruction penalties from £200 fines to potential 51-week prison sentences, with up to 10 years for &quot;public nuisance.&quot;</p>

They're holding handwritten signs with messages including "END THE FOSSIL FOOL NOW," "I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN NO MORE OIL," and "I'M FRIGHTENED FOR MY FUTURE." The protesters appear to be blocking traffic, with vehicles visible behind them on the road." width="100%">

    <p>The crackdown proved effective. Founder Roger Hallam and four activists received four-year sentences for blocking the M25, while two activists got prison time for throwing soup at Van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers. Since 2021, 173 climate activists have been jailed for non-violent offenses.<br><br>Dr Oscar Berglund suggests the &quot;real reason&quot; for JSO&#x27;s end is recruitment struggles: &quot;People are put off, people are in prison.&quot; Tim Crosland warns that treating &quot;peaceful protest as being equivalent to serious crime&quot; risks pushing activism toward &quot;potentially more extreme forms.&quot;<br><br>Some activists are transitioning to mainstream groups or local issues, while more radical groups like Shut The System have emerged, using sabotage tactics like cutting fiber-optic cables to target fossil fuel companies&#x27; insurance providers.</p>

Visible signs include "Lucia Whittaker De Abreu" marked "IMPRISONED FOR 4 YEARS" and "Roger Hallam" marked "IMPRISONED FOR 5 YEARS." The protesters appear to be advocating for these individuals, with website references to "defendourjuries.org" visible on the signs." width="100%">
