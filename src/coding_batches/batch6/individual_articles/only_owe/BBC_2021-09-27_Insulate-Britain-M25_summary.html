    <p>Climate change protesters have defied a court order and blocked part of the M25 at Heathrow Airport. A total of 53 people have been arrested as Insulate Britain blocked the slip road at junction 14 just after 08:00 BST. The road has now reopened.<br><br>A High Court injunction banning protests around the M25 and Dartford Crossing was issued last Thursday. &quot;You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere,&quot; the campaign group said.<br><br>The order, granted to National Highways Ltd, states demonstrators are banned from &quot;causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto&quot;. Those involved may be held in contempt of court and face imprisonment, fines, or asset seizure.<br><br>Ministers had hoped the High Court injunction would prevent further disruption around London. The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, is calling for the government to insulate homes in the UK to help cut carbon emissions. They want heat-saving measures installed in social housing by 2025 and all homes by 2030.</p>

    <p><br><br>Protester Dr Diana Warner, 62, a retired GP from Bristol, said she was protesting out of &quot;desperation&quot;. &quot;This is the fifth time I&#x27;ve been here trying to block a motorway because the only way to get the government to listen is to disrupt things,&quot; she said. Warner added she &quot;completely understood&quot; people&#x27;s frustrations with the protest, however, what was at risk was the &quot;lives of our children and grandchildren&quot;.<br><br>The government said it was investing Â£1.3bn to support people to install energy efficiency measures.</p>
