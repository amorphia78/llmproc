    <p>Extinction Rebellion have staged a climate change protest at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Day. Hours before official ceremonies, a banner reading &#x27;Honour Their Sacrifice, Climate Change Means War&#x27; was placed over the iconic memorial, along with a wreath of poppies bearing a slogan.<br><br>British Army veteran and Extinction Rebellion member Donald Bell, who served four tours in Northern Ireland, observed two minutes of silence before hanging the wreath. Police officers later removed it.<br><br>Private Bell, 64, who was injured in a car bomb blast in 1974, told Mirror Online: &quot;This government is criminally negligent and young people today will pay the price for their failure. I did four tours in Northern Ireland. I have been in conflict. I saw good friends - my comrades, who I served with - die.&quot;<br><br>He urged the government to heed a Ministry of Defence report warning of increased unrest and conflict due to climate change-induced droughts and food shortages. Bell stated, &quot;Unchecked climate change means a return to a world at war. I cannot stand by and let that happen. It is my duty to act.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The veteran echoed Extinction Rebellion&#x27;s demands for the Government to declare a climate crisis, form a citizen&#x27;s assembly, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.<br><br>The protest met with strong criticism. A Number 10 spokesman said on behalf of Boris Johnson: &quot;On today of all days when we join together to pay tribute to our war dead, this action was profoundly disrespectful.&quot;<br><br>The Royal British Legion stated that war memorials deserve utmost respect and that Remembrance Day is not for political protest. Some social media users expressed outrage, with one calling the protesters &quot;privileged prats&quot; and another designating them as &quot;scum.&quot;<br><br>Private Bell acknowledged the controversy, saying, &quot;I am going to be one of the most hated veterans on the planet for some time.&quot;</p>
