    <p>Parts of the M25 have been temporarily closed after Just Stop Oil protesters climbed overhead gantries and caused disruption on the major motorway circling London. A spokeswoman for the group said &quot;action has gone ahead in multiple locations on the M25&quot;.<br><br>Surrey Police reported protesters scaling gantries between junctions 6 and 7, 8 and 9, 9 and 10, and 11 and 12. Hertfordshire Police dealt with similar action at junctions 20, 22 and 23. Essex Police arrested three people, including a man and a woman attempting to climb a gantry at junction 30, and another person who locked himself onto a gantry at junction 27.<br><br>Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist called the action &quot;criminality&quot;, not protest, and pledged to bring those involved to justice as quickly as possible. He described it as &quot;a very significant and co-ordinated effort to cause massive disruption to the entirety of the M25.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The disruption occurred despite the Metropolitan Police &quot;proactively&quot; arresting campaigners suspected of planning action on UK motorways. A total of 23 people have been arrested so far.<br><br>The demonstrations took place as the latest COP27 international climate change summit in Egypt got underway. The protesters have been calling on the government to abandon plans to licence more than 100 new oil and gas projects by 2025, and to do more to help people with their skyrocketing energy bills.<br><br>National Highways has secured a High Court injunction to prevent Just Stop Oil protesters disrupting England&#x27;s busiest motorway. Anyone entering the motorway and fixing themselves to any object or structure on it, and anyone assisting in such an act, can be held in contempt of court, facing imprisonment, an unlimited fine, and the seizure of assets.</p>
