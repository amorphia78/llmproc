    <p>The QE2 bridge at the Dartford Crossing has been closed after two oil protesters climbed the structure, causing long tailbacks and significant disruption. National Highways reported two-hour delays in both directions and five to six miles of congestion.<br><br>Climate change activist group Just Stop Oil claimed responsibility, stating that two of its supporters had scaled the 84m-high masts on the north side of the bridge &quot;to demand that the government halts all new oil and gas licences and consents.&quot;<br><br>Essex Police confirmed the closure, saying, &quot;The bridge has been closed while we resolve the incident which we will do as quickly and as safely for all involved.&quot; They added that a diversion would be put in place through the tunnel, but warned of likely delays throughout the morning due to the complexities of safely getting people down from height.</p>

    <p><br><br>The bridge, which links Essex and Kent, was shut after the report of climbers was received just before 3.50am. As daylight broke, the protesters were pictured dangling from its steel cables.<br><br>One of the protesters, identified as Morgan Trowland, a 39-year-old engineer, released a statement through Just Stop Oil: &quot;I can&#x27;t challenge this madness in my desk job, designing bridges, so I&#x27;m taking direct action, occupying the QE2 bridge until the government stops all new oil.&quot;<br><br>The other protester, identified only as Marcus, 33, a teacher, said: &quot;Only direct action will now help to reach the social tipping point we so urgently need.&quot;<br><br>The protest has sparked anger among drivers facing long delays. The Dartford Crossing, which includes two tunnels, is notoriously busy as it is the only way to cross the Thames east of London by road.</p></body></html>
