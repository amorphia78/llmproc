    <p>A &#x27;Kill the Bill&#x27; rally against planned controversial protest reforms descended into chaos overnight in Bristol. Rioters torched a police van and stormed a station during Sunday&#x27;s protests, leaving 20 police officers injured. One officer suffered a collapsed lung after being stamped on, while another two officers suffered broken bones.<br><br>The protest was organised against the Government&#x27;s Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which could see the police handed more powers to tackle demonstrations. Critics view it as a Tory crackdown on the right to protest, leading some to brand the Bill an assault on democracy.<br><br>The proposed law includes an offence of &quot;intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance&quot;. Those convicted could face a fine or jail. The Government says the reforms will target disruptive protests - such as the types where streets are blocked by huge crowds causing frustration for the public.</p>

    <p><br><br>Seven arrests were made overnight - six for violent disorder and one for possession of an offensive weapon. Bristol&#x27;s Mayor, Marvin Rees, accused the &quot;self-indulgent, selfish, self-centred&quot; rioters of actually handing the Government public backing to crackdown on protest with their actions.<br><br>The Bill would also hand police more powers to crack down on unauthorised encampments and increase stop and search powers. Critics worry the risk of harsh penalties will only chill the rights of campaigners to take to the streets to get their voices heard at all.</p>
