    <p>In a landmark environmental protest action, 28 Greenpeace activists destroyed a field of genetically-modified (GM) maize on a farm in Norfolk in July 1999. The group, which included a vicar and a beauty consultant, was led by Greenpeace executive director Lord Peter Melchett, a former government minister and Norfolk farmer.<br><br>At 05:00 BST on 26 July 1999, the protesters stormed the six-acre field of modified fodder maize, trampling and pulling at the 7ft plants. They used a machine with whirling 4ft blades to destroy a large section of the crop, planning to bag it up and deliver it to Norfolk-based GM contractors AgrEvo.<br><br>The activists opposed such trials, claiming they would cause genetic pollution of the environment. Michael Uwins, Greenpeace&#x27;s East of England co-ordinator, stated, &quot;We totally believed in what we were doing. We were not anti-science or GM as such; it was about open-air field trials. It was irresponsible and had to be stopped.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The protesters were confronted by the &quot;furious&quot; landowner William Brigham and family members, who were &quot;ramming and chasing the protesters around the field.&quot; Police soon arrived, and the activists were arrested and charged with criminal damage and theft.<br><br>In court, the protesters argued they had lawful excuse for their actions, aiming to prevent neighbouring land from being unlawfully invaded by genetically-modified pollen. After two trials, all defendants were acquitted on 20 September 2000.<br><br>The verdict was seen as a triumph by environmental activists but described as &quot;perverse&quot; by the National Farmers&#x27; Union, which claimed it gave &quot;the green light to wanton vandalism and trespass.&quot;<br><br>This key moment in environmental protest brought the issue of GM crops to the attention of politicians, regulators, and the media, resulting in a more cautious approach to GMO release and testing.</p>
