    <p>The Queen will miss the State Opening of Parliament on Tuesday for the first time in nearly 60 years, due to ongoing &quot;episodic mobility problems&quot;. This marks only the third time in her reign that she has not attended this ceremonial occasion.<br><br>Prince Charles will read the Queen&#x27;s Speech on her behalf, at her request. This is the first time he has taken on such a major constitutional duty. The Duke of Cambridge will accompany him in his capacity as Counsellor of State. The Duchess of Cornwall will also attend but is not a Counsellor of State.<br><br>Buckingham Palace announced on Monday that the Queen had &quot;reluctantly decided&quot; not to attend after consulting with her doctors. A palace source noted that the monarch had continued to suffer with mobility issues since last autumn.<br><br>The decision to use Letters Patent to delegate this royal function to Counsellors of State is unprecedented and will be seen as a significant shift in the Prince of Wales&#x27;s responsibilities as heir to the throne.</p>

    <p><br><br>The Imperial State Crown and regalia will still be transported to the Houses of Parliament as usual. Prince Charles will wear his Admiral of the Fleet uniform, while Prince William is expected to wear a morning coat.<br><br>The Queen&#x27;s absence from this key constitutional event underscores her increasing frailty. In recent months, her public appearances have been significantly scaled back, with her attendance at engagements only confirmed on the day. Despite this, palace aides noted that the Queen still has a busy diary this week, including virtual engagements and some private events.</p>
