    <p>Todd Smith, 32, activist and a former airline pilot from Reading, Berkshire, criticised Farnborough Airport&#x27;s move to offer sustainable aviation fuel as an alternative.<br><br>He said: &quot;The term &#x27;sustainable aviation fuel&#x27; was coined by the aviation and fossil fuel industry to deceive the public and greenwash the utterly destructive nature of biofuels.<br><br>&quot;Biofuels result in land grabs, deforestation, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, rising food prices and land-use emissions which can be worse than the fossil fuel they are replacing.&quot;<br><br>A government spokesperson previously told the BBC: &quot;We share the passion of many to end our contribution to climate change and protect the planet for this generation and those to come.&quot;<br><br>A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman confirmed officers were at the scene of the protest and no arrests had been made.<br><br>They added: &quot;Everyone has the right to free speech and protest.&quot;<br><br>Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.
