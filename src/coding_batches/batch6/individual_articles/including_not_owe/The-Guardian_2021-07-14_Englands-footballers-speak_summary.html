        <h1>England’s footballers speak for the new generation better than any politician</h1><p>England&#x27;s national team have inherited the mantle of the official opposition, representing the voice of the nation&#x27;s under-40s – millennials and zoomers – who feel economically and socially alienated by Tory Britain. When Marcus Rashford, a &quot;23-year-old black man from Withington and Wythenshawe,&quot; shamed the government into feeding hundreds of thousands of children, he was leading a rebellion on behalf of the young working class.<br><br>The England team&#x27;s decision to take the knee affirmed the value of Black lives in a nation whose government has been accused of fanning racism for electoral ends. When Conservative ministers condemned the racism directed at England&#x27;s players, England centre-back Tyrone Mings pointed out the hypocrisy, tweeting, &quot;You don&#x27;t get to stoke the fire at the beginning of the tournament by labelling our anti-racism message as &#x27;Gesture Politics&#x27; &amp; then pretend to be disgusted when the very thing we&#x27;re campaigning against, happens.&quot;<br><br>This outspoken national team reflects a broader trend among young people, who have been revolting against a Westminster establishment they see as rigged against their living standards and progressive values. Research shows that younger Britons have shifted leftwards, with two-thirds preferring to live in a socialist economic system and large majorities blaming capitalism for the climate emergency and housing crisis.</p>

    <p><br><br>The progressive social values of the young have been forged by successful struggles for minority and women&#x27;s rights, reinforced by popular culture and mass mobilizations. These values have combined with economic insecurities stemming from shredded youth services, a slashed welfare state, student debt, housing crisis, and precarious work.<br><br>While the Tories maintain support among older, socially conservative voters, fury simmers among the country&#x27;s younger generations. This anger is likely to erupt in diverse ways, from protests to the viral tweets of football players, as young people seek to challenge the status quo.</p></body></html>
