        <h1>Inside Jack Harries and Alice Aedy’s pad in Hackney, east London</h1><p>Jack Harries, a 29-year-old documentary film-maker and climate activist, has become a prominent figure in the environmental movement. With 1.3 million followers on Instagram and 3.7 million subscribers on YouTube, Harries uses his platform to raise awareness about climate change through storytelling.<br><br>Harries and his girlfriend, Alice Aedy, 27, also a photographer and film-maker, live in a newly renovated loft-style flat in a 1920s former shoe factory in Hackney, east London. The space serves as both their home and activist headquarters for their production company, Earthrise Studio.<br><br>The couple&#x27;s approach to environmental activism has evolved from participating in Extinction Rebellion protests to creating films and photojournalism about communities affected by global warming. &quot;We spent a few years going on Extinction Rebellion protests but our friends and families didn&#x27;t want to go on the marches; it all felt a bit extreme,&quot; Harries says. &quot;We wanted to find a way to bridge the gap . . . and try to change the perception of what it is to be an environmentalist.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Their 1,000 sq ft space was renovated to create a multipurpose live/work environment that reflects their environmental values. The flat features reclaimed timber, clay walls that absorb toxins, and an abundance of houseplants. However, the couple acknowledges that they are not perfect in their environmental practices, admitting to using concrete worktops during the renovation.<br><br>Harries and Aedy are transparent about the challenges of balancing their activism with their lifestyle. They offset carbon when flying, donate to communities where they film, and try to use remote film crews on projects. &quot;This is about creating systems and structures that allow us all to do better rather than pointing a finger at the individual,&quot; Aedy explains.<br><br>Despite his celebrity status, Harries aims to shift focus from his image to environmental issues. He finds hope in grassroots actions and community-led initiatives, citing examples of individuals making a difference in their local areas.</p></body></html>
