    <p>The foul-mouthed, forever broke &#x27;Osbournes in tweeds&#x27; were a TV sensation – and showed the aristocracy as we&#x27;d never seen them before<br><br>ITV&#x27;s stately docuseries Keeping Up With The Aristocrats launched last night to a mixed reception. Following four of Britain&#x27;s most prominent dynasties - the Mountbattens, Romanoffs, Sitwells and Fitzalan-Howards - it was an awfully entertaining hour of crumbling residences, robust swearing and red trousers.<br><br>There&#x27;s a long and noble tradition of factual TV following asset-rich, cash-poor aristocrats. They might have blue blood and good breeding but they&#x27;re also frequently broke and prepared to play ball for camera crews. It&#x27;s pleasingly voyeuristic, televisual class tourism, and crucially, it&#x27;s often very funny.<br><br>TV&#x27;s current obsession with toff docs can surely be traced back to the &quot;filthy Fulfords&quot; - an eccentric clan of West Country aristos who became cult anti-heroes during the Noughties. Their outrageous antics caused a storm in a bone china teacup and saw them dubbed &quot;The Osbournes in tweeds&quot;.<br><br>Airing in August 2004 on Channel 4&#x27;s Cutting Edge strand, The F______ Fulfords followed Francis and Kishanda Fulford as they hatched hare-brained schemes to fund repairs to their dilapidated Tudor pile in rural Devon. Their bloodline could be traced back to Richard the Lionheart, who&#x27;d gifted Francis&#x27; forebears their estate in 1199 for a &quot;job well done&quot; during the Crusades.</p>

    <p><br><br>The fly-on-the-wall film exposed the family as rude, crude, uncouth and unhygienic. Their faces were ruddy, their teeth snaggly. Bat droppings pebble-dashed the soft furnishings. Their four unruly children had a penchant for fisticuffs, smashing china, slinging mud at each other and hurling cricket balls across the Great Hall.<br><br>It was chaotic, compelling and bracingly entertaining. They drank like fish, smoked like chimneys and swore like sailors. Their loudly expressed views were refreshingly un-PC. Francis railed against the Germans and French, and sneered at Americans for having &quot;a fat gene&quot;.<br><br>It attracted 3.5m viewers and earned a Bafta nomination. For a generation of viewers, it was their first introduction to just how dishevelled and down-on-their-luck posh people can be.</p>
