    <p>Russia&#x27;s invasion is leaving a toxic trace on Ukrainian soil, contaminating crops and posing a serious long-term risk to human health. Satellite images have captured hundreds of craters made by artillery shells and a 40m-wide hole left by a bomb in fields around the village of Dovhenke, in eastern Ukraine. Heavy metals, fuel and chemical residues from ammunition and missiles have seeped into the soil.<br><br>The full extent of soil contamination in Ukraine is not yet known, but there are concerns that the conflict will cause long-lasting damage to the country&#x27;s agricultural productivity. Ukraine is one of the world&#x27;s most important producers and exporters of cereals and oilseeds. The widespread pollution threatens local wildlife and the health of communities, who are at risk of eating contaminated crops.<br><br>The Ukrainian government has asked the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to help assess the environmental damage. Preliminary monitoring suggests that urban and rural landscapes could be left with a &quot;toxic legacy for generations to come&quot;. UNEP estimates that 618 industrial or critical infrastructure sites have been damaged or destroyed in the year since the war began.</p>

    <p><br><br>Environmental groups are documenting the damage to direct rehabilitation and clean-up efforts once the conflict ends. Experts agree that recultivating Ukraine&#x27;s crops and desecrated soil will involve a mammoth effort and location-specific solutions. Clean-up efforts may involve using microbes to break down oil spills, or growing plants such as brake fern and sunflowers to extract certain toxic chemicals or stabilize the soil.<br><br>The conflict is creating long-term environmental costs that may be difficult to address amid the humanitarian crisis. Monitoring is critical to direct remediation efforts to the highest priority sites. The full impact of the war on Ukraine&#x27;s environment and agricultural future remains to be seen.</p>
