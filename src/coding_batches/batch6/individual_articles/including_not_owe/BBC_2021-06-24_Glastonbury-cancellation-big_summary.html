    <p>Two years without the Glastonbury Festival has meant &quot;a big financial hit&quot; for environmental charity Greenpeace. The festival, usually taking place on the last weekend of June, was cancelled in 2021 and 2020 due to Covid-19.<br><br>Greenpeace&#x27;s events manager, Bob Wilson, said: &quot;That single donation makes up quite a big chunk of our annual income, so only having one Glastonbury festival in the last four years has been a big financial hit for us.&quot; Founder Michael Eavis is one of Greenpeace&#x27;s biggest donors, often giving up to Â£500,000 after each festival.<br><br>The organisation has been a staple part of the festival since 1991, with a dedicated Greenpeace field for environmental education and awareness. Mr Wilson explained, &quot;We went from selling badges and t-shirts and things like that in a little tent to eventually Michael saying &#x27;would you like to run a field?&#x27; It just grew from there really. It&#x27;s become quite a destination field now.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>The largest music festival in the UK, Glastonbury offers charities the opportunity to spread their message to up to 200,000 people in one weekend. Mr Wilson noted that in one particular year, &quot;we got 80,000 people signed up across the site, which is no mean feat.&quot;<br><br>Greenpeace has also missed having a key opportunity to &quot;sign up new supporters&quot; due to the cancellations. Mr Wilson expressed gratitude for the extra help from the Glastonbury team during the pandemic, saying, &quot;We can&#x27;t wait for another proper, &#x27;normal&#x27; Glastonbury, both for the financial boost it gives us, and because it&#x27;s the best party in the world.&quot;</p>
