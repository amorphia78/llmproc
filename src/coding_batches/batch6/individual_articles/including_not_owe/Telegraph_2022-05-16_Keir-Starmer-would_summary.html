        <h1>Keir Starmer would be admitting total defeat if he joined a silly 'progressive pact'</h1><h2>Imagine that: a supposed party of government standing down candidates in favour of other parties. Labour would be foolish to entertain it</h2><p>A new survey by Best for Britain has concluded that a pre-election formal pact involving the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens would pave the way for an anti-Conservative coalition. However, this proposal raises several concerns and contradictions for Labour.<br><br>Firstly, Labour is being asked to do two entirely contradictory things: insist it can win the next election on its own while simultaneously standing down candidates across the country. This would be an admission of defeat, confirming in voters&#x27; minds that Labour still hasn&#x27;t cracked the problem of appealing to them.<br><br>Moreover, the Lib Dems and the Greens are Labour&#x27;s opponents on many issues. The Greens remain unreconstructed oppositionists, and the notion that they could be relied upon to support a minority Labour administration is fanciful. A public statement of preference for a broad coalition would invite media scrutiny of potential embarrassments, such as Green candidates&#x27; social media posts or ideological differences on contentious issues.</p><p><br><br>The proposal also ignores the fact that winning elections is not an easy task, nor should it be. Labour can only succeed if it&#x27;s willing to reform and counter the demands of those who claim to be allies but are not. Agreeing to Best for Britain&#x27;s cynical old tactic would do nothing more than confirm Labour&#x27;s inability to appeal to voters on its own merits.<br><br>In conclusion, this &quot;progressive pact&quot; offers an apparently easy path to government, but it would result in a chaotic political circus rather than a strategic way forward for Britain&#x27;s progressive parties.</p></body></html>
