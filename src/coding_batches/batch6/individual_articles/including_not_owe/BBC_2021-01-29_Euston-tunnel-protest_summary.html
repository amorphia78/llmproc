    <p>Four climate change activists are risking their lives inside a network of manmade tunnels near Euston station in protest against the Â£106bn HS2 rail project. One of them is 18-year-old Blue Sandford, who has vowed to be underground for as long as it takes bailiffs to evict her.<br><br>The campaigners have occupied Euston Square Gardens since August, but HS2 requires possession of it to build a temporary taxi rank outside Euston station. To thwart their forcible removal, they have spent the past two months digging a tunnel they claim is 100ft (30m) long.<br><br>The tunnel has been widely condemned by officials and drew criticism from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who said the protesters&#x27; actions were &quot;reckless, irresponsible and deeply concerning&quot;.<br><br>Ms Sandford, a published author on climate change, says digging the tunnel - codenamed &quot;Kelvin&quot; - is the activists&#x27; &quot;best defence&quot; against being evicted, but admits it is very dangerous. Planks of reclaimed wood have been used to shore up the tunnel, but that hasn&#x27;t prevented partial collapses already. Authorities have warned that the protesters risk being buried alive.</p>

    <p><br><br>&quot;HS2 is a waste of money and time,&quot; Ms Sandford says. &quot;By the government&#x27;s own admission, it will be heavily polluting and carbon intensive while demand for mass transit is falling and home working is the new norm for many people.&quot;<br><br>Ms Sandford maintains the activists are not intent on &quot;martyring themselves&quot; - their sole intention is delaying or even stopping the HS2 project. She adds, &quot;I&#x27;m angry that the government is still effectively ignoring this crisis despite declaring a Climate and Ecological Emergency two years ago. I&#x27;m in this tunnel because they are irresponsibly putting my life at risk from the Climate and Ecological Emergency.&quot;<br><br>Despite the dangers, Ms Sandford and the other protesters have no intention of giving up. &quot;The longest tunnel eviction was six weeks. I&#x27;m prepared to stay here for as long as it takes,&quot; she says.</p>
