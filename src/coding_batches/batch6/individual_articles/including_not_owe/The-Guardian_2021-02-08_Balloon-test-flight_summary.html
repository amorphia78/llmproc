        <h1>Balloon test flight plan under fire over solar geoengineering fears</h1><p>Swedish environmental groups are voicing opposition to a proposed scientific balloon flight in northern Sweden, fearing it could lead to the use of solar geoengineering to cool the Earth. The test flight, planned for June by a team of Harvard scientists, aims to launch a high-altitude balloon from Kiruna in Lapland to assess its capability to carry equipment for a future small-scale experiment on radiation-reflecting particles in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.<br><br>While the June flight does not involve the release of particles, environmental organizations, including the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, Greenpeace Sweden, and Friends of the Earth Sweden, argue that it could be the first step towards adopting a potentially &quot;dangerous, unpredictable, and unmanageable&quot; technology.<br><br>The groups have written to the Swedish government and the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) expressing their concerns. They argue that the balloon flight must be viewed as integral to the project&#x27;s intention of conducting open-air testing and particle releases in the future.</p>

    <p><br><br>The letter to the Swedish minister for environment and climate states: &quot;We appeal to the Swedish government to oppose the SSC&#x27;s involvement with SCoPEx&#x27;s proposed tests, as they are fundamentally incompatible with the precautionary principle, in breach of international norms, and inconsistent with Sweden&#x27;s own climate policy framework as well as its reputation as an international climate leader.&quot;<br><br>The environmental groups further argue that stratospheric aerosol injections (SAI) technology has the potential for extreme consequences and is too dangerous to ever be used. They emphasize that there is no justification for testing and experimenting with such technology.<br><br>An independent advisory committee will decide by February 15 whether to approve the balloon test flight. The Swedish government has not provided comment on the matter, while an SSC spokesperson stated that the flight would only be conducted if compliant with national and international regulations.</p></body></html>
