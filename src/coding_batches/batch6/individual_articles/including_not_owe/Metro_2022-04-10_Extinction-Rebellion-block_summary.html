    <p>Extinction Rebellion (XR) caused chaos across central London today, with environmental activists blocking bridges and staging sit down protests. Dozens of activists were arrested as they demanded an end to the use of fossil fuels on the second day of major protests in the city.<br><br>Both Lambeth and Vauxhall bridges were &#x27;occupied&#x27; by demonstrators who prevented traffic from crossing, though emergency service vehicles were allowed to pass. Crowds sat in the middle of the road, waving flags showing the group&#x27;s &#x27;extinction&#x27; symbol and holding placards that read &#x27;there is no planet B&#x27; and &#x27;we want to live&#x27;.<br><br>Police began clearing both bridges after several hours, making 38 arrests in the process. Officers physically removed the last of the activists, a number of whom were taken away in police vans. Doctors and nurses from a small group of medical workers who refused to leave Lambeth Bridge were among those arrested, Extinction Rebellion said.</p>

    <p><br><br>Activist and student Kiri Ley, 21, from Birmingham, defended the group&#x27;s tactics, saying, &quot;We tried all the other methods – we&#x27;ve written letters, we&#x27;ve marched, we&#x27;ve spoken to our MPs, we&#x27;ve done literally everything we can and time and time again we see them doing completely the opposite of what the scientific evidence says and this is what is left to us, really, we do it because we know it works.&quot;<br><br>Adam, in his 60s, from York, added: &quot;This may seem disruptive, but it is chicken feed in comparison to climate change.&quot;<br><br>Extinction Rebellion has vowed to &quot;block areas of the city for as long as possible&quot; every day for at least a week, and on the next three weekends. &quot;Our disruption will not stop until the fossil fuel economy comes to an end,&quot; the group stated on its website.</p>
