    <p>This Morning viewers were left astonished when a guest appeared on the programme to raise awareness of climate change in a unique way, sitting naked on the sofa in the studio. Laura Amherst, a protester for Extinction Rebellion, was invited onto Thursday&#x27;s edition of This Morning to speak to Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby about why she uses her bold method to bring attention to her cause.<br><br>The banner on the TV screen about Laura stated: &#x27;I protest topless to help save the planet.&#x27; Laura told Phillip and Holly that in an ideal world, people would listen to what she had to say about climate change straight away, and so she wouldn&#x27;t need to go to extreme lengths to get their attention.<br><br>While Phillip and Holly questioned Laura about her activism, some viewers watching the show expressed their shock over Laura making an appearance stark naked, with several questioning if there was any sort of blanket or cover on the couch. &#x27;Is she fully naked I hope they dettol the sofa afterwards,&#x27; one person tweeted, while another asked: &#x27;#ThisMorning is her bare bottom on that sofa?&#x27;</p>

    <p><br><br>Several people said that in their opinion, Laura was drawing more attention to herself than to her cause. &#x27;I&#x27;m sorry but her going naked won&#x27;t make people see the cause, they&#x27;ll just gawp &amp; keep it moving,&#x27; one critic stated. Another viewer said she was &#x27;doing more harm than good to the climate campaign&#x27;, adding: &#x27;Campaigns should focus on the serious issues rather than some woman taking her clothes off, which has no connection to climate change issues.&#x27;<br><br>However, another viewer praised Laura for how she composed herself during the interview, saying: &#x27;Omg well done that topless woman!!! Speaking so well, so calmly and simply asking that you think about the cause and why these actions to draw attention and disrupt are necessary. Amazing, well done #ThisMorning.&#x27;</p></body></html>
