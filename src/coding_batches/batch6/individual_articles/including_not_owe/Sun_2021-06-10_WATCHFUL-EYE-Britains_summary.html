    <p>Britain&#x27;s new £3.3billion aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, is keeping watch over Carbis Bay as the three-day G7 summit commences. The vessel forms part of a secure &#x27;ring of steel&#x27; ahead of the meeting between President Joe Biden and Boris Johnson.<br><br>The security measures include HMS Northumberland, a Type 23 frigate, positioned off the coast to help identify potential threats from air and sea. A Giraffe agile multi-beam radar system has been deployed for coastal surveillance, and 15 explosives search dogs and handlers from the army are operating under police command.<br><br>The airspace above Cornwall is largely shut, with police reserving the option to deploy one of their 18 drones if necessary. Around 1,000 police will be staying on a cruise liner at Falmouth harbour and in camper vans parked at the RAF base in Newquay.<br><br>The cost of policing the summit has been put at £70million, with officers called in from other forces to support Devon and Cornwall Police. As part of the security ramp-up, police have closed down up to 30 bridges across the A30, one of the main roads leading into and through Cornwall.</p>
