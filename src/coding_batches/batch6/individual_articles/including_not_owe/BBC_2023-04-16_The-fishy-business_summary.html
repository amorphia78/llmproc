    <p>A Chinese-owned fishmeal factory in Gunjur, The Gambia, is causing significant disruption to the local fishing community. The facility, run by Golden Lead, is one of three such factories in the country producing fish oil and fishmeal for export to China, Europe, and beyond.<br><br>Local fishermen and residents are upset about the factory&#x27;s impact on their livelihoods and the environment. Buba Cary, a fisherman with 32 years of experience, claims that fish stocks have drastically decreased since the factory&#x27;s arrival. Kelepha Camara, a fish trader, adds that the factory has driven up fish prices for locals.<br><br>The factory&#x27;s operations have raised concerns about sustainability, as it uses vast quantities of fish that make up at least half of The Gambia&#x27;s total protein intake. The Dutch NGO Changing Markets Foundation found that the largest fishmeal factory accounted for 40% of Gambia&#x27;s entire fish catch for a year.<br><br>Environmental issues have also been reported. In May 2017, a nearby lagoon in the Bolong Fenyo wildlife reserve filled with dead fish and turned red. The National Environment Agency filed a case against Golden Lead, but operations resumed after an out-of-court settlement of $25,000.</p>

    <p><br><br>Local residents complain that Golden Lead has broken commitments made to the fishing community, including promises to build infrastructure and provide 600 jobs. According to an anonymous factory worker, only 40 Gambians are employed at the plant, with poor conditions and low pay.<br><br>Environmentalists and activists, including microbiologist Ahmed Manjang, have taken Golden Lead to court, citing $250,000 in environmental damages. However, the case has been repeatedly adjourned since July 2017.<br><br>Despite these concerns, Fishery Minister Omar Gibba defends the factory, citing foreign investment and job creation. He dismisses criticisms about overfishing and harmful waste dumping, stating that regulations are in place to address these issues.</p>
