        <h1>Do we really care more about Van Gogh’s sunflowers than real ones?</h1><p>Two Just Stop Oil activists threw soup at Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers in the National Gallery in London, decorating the glass protecting the painting with tomato soup. The painting itself was undamaged, as the protesters had calculated. This action appears to have horrified some people more than the collapse of our planet, which these campaigners are seeking to prevent.<br><br>The protesters&#x27; tactics have been labeled &quot;extreme&quot; by some, who claim that such actions will prompt people to &quot;stop listening.&quot; However, the article argues that we are already paying little attention to warnings from scientists, campaigners, and eminent committees about the destruction of the habitable planet.<br><br>The response by the media and government to this protest action has been significant. Home Secretary Suella Braverman claimed that while there is widespread agreement on the need to protect the environment, &quot;democracies reach decisions in a civilised manner.&quot; The article questions this statement, pointing out various government decisions that seem to contradict environmental protection goals, such as awarding new licenses for oil and gas drilling in the North Sea.</p>

    <p><br><br>The article suggests that such disruptive protest actions are necessary to shake people out of their &quot;stupor&quot; regarding the climate crisis. It argues that we are approaching planetary tipping points with unimaginable consequences, and that more drastic measures are needed to alert people to the scale of the crisis.<br><br>The piece also criticizes recent legislation that criminalizes effective means of protest, leaving only authorized, near-silent processions and ignored letters to MPs as permissible forms of dissent.<br><br>Ultimately, the article questions why we seem to value depictions of life more than life itself, and why ecological destruction is often justified as &quot;the price of progress&quot; while damage to art is considered abhorrent.</p></body></html>
