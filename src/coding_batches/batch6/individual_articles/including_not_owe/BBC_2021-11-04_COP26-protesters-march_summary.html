    <p>Climate change protesters have targeted UK government offices and a shipyard in Glasgow. Hundreds of Extinction Rebellion activists assembled at an immigration centre in the Cessnock area before marching to nearby BAE Systems. Police have lined the gates of the Govan yard where protesters have blocked the road.<br><br>Douglas Renshaw, of Extinction Rebellion Glasgow, said BAE Systems had been targeted because of what he described as the link between military action and climate change. He stated, &quot;Our governments have allowed spending on arms to outstrip spending on climate solutions. They&#x27;ve created a brutal world where many face conflict over ravaged resources.&quot;<br><br>Protestor Bhavini Patel told BBC Scotland she was part of a protest outside the Home Office immigration facility in Cessnock to highlight what will happen to people forced to move from their homes by climate change. She said, &quot;We&#x27;re going to see lots of displaced form the climate emergency. They want to be in their homes, they want to be in their country, they don&#x27;t want to be here but they do need our support and solidarity right now.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>Protesters gave speeches and banged drums outside the Home Office building before setting off for BAE Systems. The demonstration aims to draw attention to the connection between military spending, climate change, and forced migration.<br><br>Leading climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg has shared her dismay at the COP26 summit in a tweet that describes it as a &quot;greenwash festival&quot;. The protests come as part of a series of demonstrations during the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow, which is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.</p>
