    <p>The vigil for Sarah Everard on Clapham Common in south London turned into a PR disaster for the Metropolitan Police when their attempts to break up the gathering led to confrontations with attendees. The event, which was not officially sanctioned due to COVID-19 restrictions, saw hundreds of people gather at the bandstand around 18:00 GMT.<br><br>Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball stated that officers faced a difficult decision as the crowd posed a &quot;very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-19.&quot; The police attempted to disperse the gathering and remove individuals they believed were contributing to the crowding.<br><br>One attendee, Patsy Stevenson, was photographed being handcuffed on the ground and received a Â£200 Covid fine. The Metropolitan Police Federation reported that 26 officers were assaulted during the event, being punched, kicked, and spat at.</p>

    <p><br><br>The police&#x27;s handling of the vigil has drawn criticism, with some accusing them of oppressing women. Questions have been raised about why this demonstration was considered a greater Covid risk than others, such as the Black Lives Matter protests last summer.<br><br>Home Secretary Priti Patel has requested an external review of the event by Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary. The outcome of this review may determine the future of Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who is facing calls to resign.<br><br>The incident highlights the challenges of public order policing, particularly during the pandemic, and the ongoing debate about the balance between public health measures and the right to protest.</p>
