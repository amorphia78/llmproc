        <h1>Work on Cambo oilfield paused after Shell withdrawal</h1><p>Work on the Cambo oilfield off Shetland is being paused, its developers have said, plunging the future of oil exploration in the area into doubt. Shell, which had been planning to develop the field with the private equity-backed fossil fuel explorer Siccar Point Energy, pulled out of the project last week after fierce opposition from environmental activists.<br><br>Siccar&#x27;s chief executive, Jonathan Roger, said: &quot;Following Shell&#x27;s announcement last week, we are in a position where the Cambo project cannot progress on the originally planned timescale. We are pausing the development while we evaluate next steps.&quot;<br><br>The move throws the future of the project, which could yield hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, into doubt and raises questions within the UK&#x27;s oil industry over other large-scale oil schemes in the North Sea. One industry source told the Guardian that Cambo&#x27;s derailment was a &quot;turning point&quot; for the UK&#x27;s North Sea oil and gas industry as it faces growing opposition due to climate concerns.</p>

    <p><br><br>Green campaigners have argued that Cambo, which lies 78 miles west of Shetland&#x27;s islands in waters 1,000 metres deep, should not get a green light given the UK&#x27;s legally binding target to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The International Energy Agency said earlier this year that no new oil and gas exploration and development should be conducted after this year if the world was to stay within 1.5C of global heating.<br><br>Siccar Point Energy said that although the project had been paused it continued to believe Cambo was &quot;a robust project that can play an important part of the UK&#x27;s energy security&quot;. However, industry sources said the explorer would struggle to find a new partner to replace Shell.</p></body></html>
