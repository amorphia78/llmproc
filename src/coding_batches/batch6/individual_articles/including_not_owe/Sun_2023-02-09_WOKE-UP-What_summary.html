        <h1>WOKE UP What does being woke mean? Definition and meaning explained</h1><p>The term &quot;woke&quot; has become a significant part of modern society, often used in discussions about social awareness and justice. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, &quot;woke&quot; is defined as &quot;alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice.&quot; The Urban Dictionary adds that being woke means &quot;being aware... knowing what&#x27;s going on in the community (related to racism and social injustice).&quot;<br><br>Originally, &quot;woke&quot; simply meant not being asleep, but its secondary meaning emerged in Black English at least by the 1940s. By the 1960s, it was used in the context of political awareness, especially regarding the Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King Jr. referenced the concept in a 1965 commencement address, urging graduates to &quot;remain awake through this social revolution.&quot;<br><br>The term gained renewed prominence in 2012 following the shooting of Trayvon Martin, with calls to &quot;stay woke&quot; to discrimination and injustice faced by black people in the US. It further spread on social media under the hashtag &quot;#staywoke&quot; in 2014 after similar incidents.</p>

    <p><br><br>However, &quot;woke&quot; has also become a contentious term, often used as a dismissive insult by right-wing groups or older generations when people stand up against offensive practices. It is sometimes used to end conversations through insult rather than confront difficult topics.<br><br>Today, the term is widely used both by social reform seekers and those opposing them. It is most often employed in the context that society needs to awaken to societal issues affecting all, not just the majority or mainstream. The word remains firmly rooted in Black English and continues to heavily reference the fight against racism.</p></body></html>
