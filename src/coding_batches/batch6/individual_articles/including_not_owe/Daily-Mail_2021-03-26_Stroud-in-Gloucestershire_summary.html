    <p>Stroud in Gloucestershire has been named the best place to live in the UK as judges praised its transport links, countryside, schools and &#x27;independent spirit&#x27;. The town topped the Sunday Times list of 78 locations across the country which looks for improving areas, well designed homes and community spirit.<br><br>Helen Davies, The Times and Sunday Times property editor, said: &#x27;This guide has never been so important. The pandemic has taught us just how much we rely on our homes, our communities and our surroundings. With working from home now common, it&#x27;s no surprise that many of us are reassessing our priorities and thinking hard about where we really want to live.&#x27;<br><br>Stroud, which has an average house price of £265,000 and an average rental price of £700 pcm, was chosen as the winner because &#x27;it has all the basics covered in perfect style: it has excellent schools, convenient transport links and easy access to lots of glorious green space. Best of all it has a unique independent spirit that comes to the fore in its impressive local food scene and at the brilliant weekly farmers&#x27; market that brings the town and surrounding countryside together.&#x27;</p>

    <p><br><br>The overall winner was praised for its independent spirit and is known for its 50-stall farmers&#x27; market on Saturdays, as well as farm shops with local produce boasting fruit, veg and meats. The town also has Woodruffs, Britain&#x27;s first organic cafe.<br><br>The capital of the south western Cotswolds and located at the divergence of the five Golden Valleys, designer Jasper Conran once described it as the &#x27;Covent Garden of the Cotswolds&#x27;.<br><br>Covid restrictions meant the judges were not able to make as many visits as usual to see the towns, cities and villages in the UK. Instead they used chats with residents who wanted to share their love of their homes. The pandemic also changed priorities as this year it focused on countryside, community and convenience.</p>
