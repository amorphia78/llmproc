    <p>Left-wing activists have taken to Twitter to criticize the closure of Sydney Harbour Bridge this weekend for filming of Ryan Gosling&#x27;s The Fall Guy. The closure comes weeks after climate change protester Deanna &#x27;Violet&#x27; Coco, 31, was sent to prison in December for eight months after she blocked a lane in April.<br><br>Twitter activists fumed at what they called a &#x27;double standard&#x27; after Ms Coco was put behind bars for what a magistrate called &#x27;selfish emotional&#x27; actions. One wrote, &#x27;Filming a Ryan Gosling flick closes the Harbour Bridge. All good. But a woman delays traffic on same to protest fossil fuels and she&#x27;s imprisoned. Got it.&#x27;<br><br>The court was told Coco drove a large hire truck along the Cahill Expressway on the bridge to purposefully block a lane during peak hour on April 13, around 8.30am. While the truck was obstructing traffic, she stood on top of it, held a lit emergency flare and livestreamed the event. After 25 minutes, police arrived and forcibly removed the protesters from the iconic Sydney landmark, with Coco resisting arrest.</p>

    <p><br><br>Defence lawyer Mark Davis told the court a &#x27;salient fact&#x27; in Coco&#x27;s case was that she only blocked one lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge when there were five. &#x27;One lane was blocked ... it was a deliberate decision to only block one lane,&#x27; Mr Davis said. &#x27;To put it simply, the traffic may have still been moving, there was no suggestion there was backup of traffic.&#x27;<br><br>Coco was convicted and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight months. Her legal counsel immediately filed an appeal. Coco is a serial protester and a member of climate activist groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Fireproof Australia.</p>
