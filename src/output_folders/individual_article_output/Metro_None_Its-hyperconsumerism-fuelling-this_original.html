    <p>Do you agree with our readers? Have your say on these MetroTalk topics and more in the comments.<br><br>As an 18-year-old, I partially agree with Atticus (MetroTalk, Mon), who says that rather than facing a mental health crisis, the young have no emotional ‘resilience’.<br><br>Many of my peers and I do have ambition but constant distractions and the dopamine cycles from phones hold us back – fuelling ADHD, depression and short attention spans, which impact resilience. But it’s not simply our fault. Hyper-consumerism, rooted in capitalism, has rewired our brains, normalising instant gratification while stripping away focus and fulfilment. Previous generations had more stability, while we’ve grown up in a system that thrives on keeping us distracted and unfulfilled.<br><br>It’s not just a lack of drive – it’s a society engineered to keep us chasing, consuming and never truly satisfied that feeds into a vicious cycle contributing to the mental health crisis. Jaismeen, London<br><br>‘A few older people are devoid of empathy’I’m a member of Gen Z and one of many who is in gainful employment while suffering mental health issues.<br><br>I wonder where that leaves me in Atticus’ narrow-minded assessment of my generation. Unlike him, I recognise that many people of all generations have mental afflictions worse than mine and are unable to work.<br><br>His diatribe is emblematic of the sad fact quite a few older people are devoid of empathy. Ash, Derby<br><br>‘Being on a train without doing anything does not make me weird’ I thought the article about podcaster Curtis Morton ostracising people for just sitting on a train minding their own business (Metro.co.uk, Mar 31) must have been for April Fool’s Day.<br><br>Criticising someone who gets on a train and sits quietly without having to use a phone, read a book, have earphones on etc is ludicrous and giving them a name like ‘barebackers’ is horrible.<br><br>Send in yours and Metro&#x27;s Senior Politics Reporter Craig Munro will answer it in an upcoming edition of our weekly politics newsletter.

    <p>Just because I sit on a train without doing any of the above does not make me weird and the fact you insinuated such in an article may make people target me and other people like me. Corin, London<br><br>‘Flowers later!’We need more oil and gas from the North Sea as a form of national security, yet John Woodhouse (MetroTalk, Mon) opposes this ‘scaremongering’, saying, ‘We have to cut down on fossil fuels to reach net zero.’<br><br>What’s the point of net zero when there’s a looming war in Europe? During World War II, Brits even replaced their flowerbeds with vegetable crops as the country needed more food. Flowers later! Alf, London<br><br>‘on behalf of everyone – thank you.’To the activists of Just Stop Oil, who say they will end their campaigns this month (Metro, Fri), and on behalf of everyone – thank you.<br><br>Thank you for doing what the rest of  us couldn’t.<br><br>For standing up for what is right in the face of overwhelming power.<br><br>For sacrificing so much to protect the futures of all species on Earth.<br><br>For raising awareness of the existential threat of climate collapse, to expose corruption and to inspire others.<br><br>And thank you for showing our craven leaders that we are not giving up our planet without a fight. What we’ve seen is only the beginning.
