    <p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil activists disrupted the World Snooker Championships at Sheffield&#x27;s Crucible Theatre. Edred Whittingham, 26, jumped on a table and covered it with orange corn starch powder during a match, while Margaret Reid, 53, a former museum worker, attempted the same on another table but was tackled by a referee. Both said their actions aimed to draw attention to the climate crisis, with Whittingham stating he intended disruption, not damage. The protest caused Â£899.90 damage and delayed match completion.</p>
