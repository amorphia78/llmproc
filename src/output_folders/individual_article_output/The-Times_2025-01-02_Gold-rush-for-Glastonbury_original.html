    <p>Neil Young may not be bringing his Harvest to “corporate” Glastonbury but the festival seems set on further expansion after reporting record profits.<br><br>Young, 79, withdrew from this year’s festival on Tuesday, but the organisers revealed a doubling of profits in their annual accounts and hinted at expansion of the 900-acre site at Worthy Farm in Somerset, having spent £3.65 million on a new land.<br><br>Last year, the festival, which hosted 4,000 performances on more than 100 stages, drew 210,000 people over its five days. Tickets for this year’s event, which cost nearly £380, sold out in 35 minutes.<br><br>• Neil Young returns to Spotify two years after vaccine row<br><br>Young, one of the world’s most acclaimed musicians with a career spanning six decades, said he was pulling out of Glastonbury because it was a “corporate turn-off” and blamed the BBC, the holder of its broadcasting rights since 1997.<br><br>In a post on his website, Young said he and his band, the Chrome Hearts, had been looking forward to the festival, which he described as “one of my all time favourite outdoor gigs”.<br><br>But Young added: “We were told that the BBC was now a partner in Glastonbury and wanted us to do a lot of things in a way we were not interested in. It seems Glastonbury is now under corporate controls and is not the way I remember it being.”<br><br>He said: “We will not be playing Glastonbury on this tour because it is a corporate turn-off, and not for me like it used to be.”<br><br>While the festival has plenty of corporate partnerships, including with Vodafone and Co-op, it is the BBC’s presence that is felt largest. It deploys more than 50km of fibre optic cable to connect 65 cameras on five stages. In 2023 it broadcast 90 hours of performances and its coverage was watched by 23 million people.<br><br>• Divas, drones and downpours: Backstage with the BBC at Glastonbury<br><br>Young, who came to fame in the 1960s and 1970s with albums such as After the Gold Rush and Harvest, had not yet been announced for this year’s Glastonbury.</p>

    <p>He clashed with the BBC when he headlined the festival in 2009. Following complaints by viewers about the corporation’s brief coverage of Young’s set that year, it said that after two months of discussions, the singer had allowed them to show only five songs.<br><br>“Neil Young’s career has been conducted on his own terms,” Mark Cooper, the BBC’s head of music television at the time, said, adding that Young’s management “agreed to let TV and radio broadcast five songs as they watched and listened to his performance”.<br><br>“They believe in the live event and retaining its mystery and that of their artist,” Cooper added.<br><br>Young’s withdrawal leaves a headline-sized hole in this year’s programme, with only Rod Stewart confirmed.<br><br>Last year’s headliners were Dua Lipa, Coldplay and SZA, with Shania Twain in the Sunday afternoon legends slot.<br><br>• 17 best Glastonbury performances of all time<br><br>The festival, which did not respond to requests for comment, appears to be in rude financial health.<br><br>Its accounts show that turnover in the year to March 2024 grew by £11 million to £68 million, with pre-tax profits doubling to nearly £6 million. It donated more than £5 million to organisations including the NHS and Greenpeace and gave more than £1 million to local groups and charities in return for services such as volunteer stewards.<br><br>They also show that Sir Michael Eavis, 89, the dairy farmer who founded the festival in 1970, has transferred his shares to his daughter, Emily, who already runs “day-to-day organisation”.<br><br>In a previous statement to the Financial Times, the festival said: “Following record losses caused by Covid — when Glastonbury’s 2020 and 2021 events were unable to go ahead, costing the festival millions — we were pleased to enjoy successful, dry Glastonburys in both 2023 and 2024.”</p>
