    <p>PRIMARY: Five Just Stop Oil activists were sentenced to record jail terms (4-5 years each) for orchestrating November 2022 M25 protests that caused four days of disruption. The plan involved protesters climbing steel gantries over the M25 to force police to stop traffic. Key figures included organic farmer Roger Hallam (the &quot;ideas man&quot;), social worker Daniel Shaw, ex-teacher Louise Lancaster, Cambridge student Cressida Gethin, and activist Lucia Whittaker De Abreu. Their demand was climate action through &quot;the biggest disruption in British history.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>SECONDARY: The activists defied court orders during their trial by attempting to discuss climate change, resulting in bail revocation and contempt proceedings.<br><br>OTHER FOCAL: A Sun journalist infiltrated JSO planning meetings using undercover methods, recording evidence that led to pre-dawn police raids and the activists&#x27; eventual prosecution.<br><br>TONE: Extremely negative, describing the protesters as &quot;eco zealots,&quot; &quot;fanatics,&quot; and a &quot;cult.&quot;</p>
