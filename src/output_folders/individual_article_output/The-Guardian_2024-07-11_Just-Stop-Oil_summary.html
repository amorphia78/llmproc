        <h1>Just Stop Oil activists found guilty of conspiring to block M25 traffic</h1><p>PRIMARY: Five Just Stop Oil activists were found guilty of conspiring to cause public nuisance by organizing protests that blocked traffic on London&#x27;s M25 motorway in November 2022. The protesters climbed gantries over the motorway, causing four days of disruption with an estimated economic loss of £750,000 and £1m in police costs. The defendants demanded action on climate change, arguing their actions were justified to raise alarm about government and business culpability for climate breakdown.<br><br>SECONDARY: During the trial, 11 people were arrested for protesting outside Southwark crown court with signs about jurors&#x27; rights, and over 80 protesters gathered outside court on the final day with placards.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The trial became chaotic with defendants repeatedly arrested for contempt of court. The judge ruled that climate change evidence was irrelevant to their defense, preventing presentation of a 250-page climate evidence bundle.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral tone, factually reporting both the prosecution&#x27;s case and the defendants&#x27; climate justifications.</p></body></html>
