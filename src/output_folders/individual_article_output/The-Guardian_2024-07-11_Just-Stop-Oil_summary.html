    <p><br><br>Each defendant sought to argue that their alleged actions were justified to raise the alarm over the culpability of government and big business for accelerating climate breakdown.<br><br>Each defendant claimed they were not granted a fair trial after the judge ruled that evidence about climate change could play no part in their defence. The defendants were able to get the prosecution to agree to a list of &quot;facts not in dispute&quot; relating to the climate crisis, including that climate change represented an &quot;existential threat to humanity&quot; and that in November 2022 the UK government had opened a new round of licensing for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.</p></body></html>
