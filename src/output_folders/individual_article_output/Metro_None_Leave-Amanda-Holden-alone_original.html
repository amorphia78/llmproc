    <p>First on the dance floor. Knocking back shots. The odd sexy move.<br><br>That’s how I spent my time at two of my children’s milestone parties.<br><br>So, no, I don’t think Amanda Holden is in the wrong for doing similar at her daughter, Lexi’s, 18th this weekend. In fact, I applaud her for it.<br><br>At a similar age to Amanda, I feel lucky to still be a party-loving girl and to be able to live my best life.<br><br>Growing old and staying young at heart can be challenging, but it’s something I pride myself on – and I know my kids love it.<br><br>They are now 21 and 23, but at both their 18th and 21st parties, I was the life and soul – just like Amanda.<br><br>OK, I may not have worn a sparkly white pair of trousers with a coordinating top with a slit at the back to show off my body, but Amanda’s choice of clothing is known to be sexy.<br><br>And frankly, if you can look that good at her age, why wouldn’t you rock it at a family celebration?<br><br>I’ve done the limbo, got the crowd dancing with a conga line and grabbed the mic to sing.<br><br>Sure, my kids would probably cringe if I busted certain moves (I wouldn’t dream of twerking or doing the latest TikTok dance) but their friends think everything else I do is hysterical.<br><br>To them, I’m the ‘cool mum’ that just wants to have fun. And I’m pretty sure Lexi and her friends think the same.<br><br>This is Amanda Holden after all. She’s known for her vivacious personality. Her high energy kicks and outlook on life is a joy to see.<br><br>If she were to be quiet, sit in a corner and wear a polo neck, then we’d be worried.<br><br>She has always been a go-getter, but in my most recent interview with her, she told me: ‘Since turning 50 I just want to go out there and grab life by the balls.’ A sentiment I whole-heartedly agree with.<br><br>Of course, there has been much criticism of older women – particularly celebrities – who need to cover up, slow down and not be so out there.<br><br>That’s evident enough from the comment section on the post the 52-year-old shared on Instagram of her singing on the microphone.<br><br>Trolls quickly popped up to criticise the mum of two for hogging the limelight. ‘Is this your daughter’s party or is it about you?’ One user wrote.<br><br>Another follower added: ‘The fake sexy dancing is shocking.’<br><br>Some even said she embarrassed her kids (which I doubt is true) and even if they were, that’s part of our job, to rib our offspring occasionally.<br><br>The good thing about Amanda is that she will be able to turn a blind eye to these comments.<br><br>She told me how she no longer cares about what people think of her, remaining steadfastly unapologetic for all of her life choices.<br><br>‘I don’t care,’ she said. ‘Maybe it’s empowering or perhaps dangerous to feel like that, but this is the real me.’</p>

    <p>Let’s also not forget that, even though Amanda is a celebrity, she’s also a mum with all the same emotions as any normal person.<br><br>At a recent interview, I overheard her chatting to Lexi. It sounded like she was talking about driving lessons and the conversation between the two echoed one I had shared with my kids.<br><br>‘Be careful. Text me when you’re home. Have your wits about you.’<br><br>She probably shares a lot of every other parent’s worries, hopes and dreams – she just has better clothes while doing it.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.

Have fun. Get drunk (if that’s what you want to do). Or – as Amanda did – dance along to Sophie Ellis Bexter’s hit song Murder on the Dancefloor like you would have when it first came out.<br><br>You won’t upset anyone important. Anyone that is offended just needs to shake it off and bust a move themselves.<br><br>Just because we are ageing, doesn’t mean we need to grow up.<br><br>Do you have a story you’d like to share?
