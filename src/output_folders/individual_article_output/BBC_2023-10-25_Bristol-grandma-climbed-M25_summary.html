    <p>PRIMARY: A 76-year-old retired teacher and grandmother, Gaie Delap from Bristol, climbed a motorway gantry on the M25 in November 2022 as part of a Just Stop Oil protest. She is one of 12 protesters accused of breaching a court injunction. The protest affected several junctions across Surrey, London, Essex and Kent, causing considerable delays. The protesters demand the government &quot;stop new oil and gas&quot; and want the climate emergency taken more seriously.</p>
