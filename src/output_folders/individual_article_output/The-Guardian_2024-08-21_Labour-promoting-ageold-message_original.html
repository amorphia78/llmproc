    <p>Amnesty International UK says Labour is ‘reheating’ the previous government’s rhetoric as Yvette Cooper vows to increase removals<br><br>Clean water campaigner Feargal Sharkey has written an opinion piece for the Guardian about the ways in which privatised water firms have polluted English rivers and beaches with sewage, causing significant damage to public health.<br><br>You can read it in full here:<br><br>Today’s episode of the Guardian’s Today in Focus podcast focuses on the UK government continuing to grant arms export licences to British companies selling arms to Israel.<br><br>On Friday, the British diplomat Mark Smith resigned from the Foreign Office over the UK government’s arms sales to Israel, saying they “may be complicit in war crimes”.<br><br>On today’s podcast, my colleague, Lucy Hough, is joined by the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, to discuss the significance of Smith’s resignation.<br><br>Steve Valdez-Symonds, refugee and migrant rights programme director at Amnesty International UK, has responded to the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, vowing to increase removals to levels not seen since Theresa May’s government (see earlier post at 10.12 for more details).<br><br>Plans include 100 more new intelligence officers to target people smuggling gangs and reopening immigration removal centres in Hampshire and Oxfordshire.<br><br>Valdez-Symonds said Labour is simply “reheating” the previous government’s rhetoric and should instead focus on establishing safe routes to reduce the dangers of border crossings and reduce the risk of vulnerable people being exploited by criminal gangs.<br><br>He said the government is “promoting an age-old message of fear and hostility regarding some of the most victimised and traumatised people”. While the vast majority of people come to the UK legally, it is dangerous Channel crossings in small boats that have become politically central. This was notably the case for the former prime minister Rishi Sunak who made “stop the boats” his flagship immigration policy.<br><br>Valdez-Symonds said:<br><br>It’s dismaying to see the new government reheating the last government’s rhetoric over ‘border security’ and ‘smashing gangs’ even while neglecting the pressing need to provide safe asylum routes and a clear guarantee of asylum to refugees arriving here.<br><br>People in urgent need - including those fleeing war and persecution in places like Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria and Iran - will keep coming to the UK and other countries, and the government needs to establish safe routes that reduce the perils of dangerous border crossings and the risk of exploitation by ruthless smuggling gangs.<br><br>This ‘securitised’ approach to asylum and immigration will simply deter and punish many of the people most in need of crossing borders, people who are therefore often most vulnerable to criminal exploitation.<br><br>Increasing immigration powers - including to detain people - rather than making sure existing powers are only used where that is necessary and fair has for decades rewarded Home Office inefficiency and injustice.<br><br>A new set of ministers promoting an age-old message of fear and hostility regarding some of the most victimised and traumatised people who may ever arrive in the UK, means that smuggling gangs and racist and Islamophobic hate-mongers at home are likely to feed off this to everyone’s detriment.<br><br>Moves are being planned in an attempt to avert a strike by officers at the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the PA news agency reports.<br><br>Members of the Nautilus International union will take action on 3 September 2024 to coincide with merchant navy day.<br><br>The strike follows a walkout last week – the first by officers in the history of the service.<br><br> Officers have also been undertaking a continuous period of action short of strike since June 2024.<br><br>A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “The Royal Fleet Auxiliary are highly valued, and we are committed to listening to their concerns and keeping a continued dialogue with them to address the issues they have raised.”<br><br>Ministers have met with the RFA twice in the first few weeks of the government and further negotiations are planned.<br><br>Ministers are under pressure to end the “postcode lottery” on water by introducing a single social tariff for households on low incomes, amid fresh signs consumers are struggling to keep up with bill payments.<br><br>Water companies in England and Wales offer their own social tariffs, providing discounts to consumers on low incomes. However, some of the schemes are more generous than others, creating vast disparities in how much consumers pay in different regions.<br><br>Campaigners have argued that a central funding pot into which all water companies pay would help more people.<br><br>In a letter to the minister for water and flooding, Emma Hardy, seen by the Guardian, 14 charities said the new government had a “huge opportunity” to help people in poverty with their water costs.<br><br>The charities, including Independent Age, Money Advice Trust, Parkinson’s UK and Age UK, said such an initiative would “make a tangible positive difference to the lives of people of all ages living on low incomes”.<br><br>You can read the full story by my colleague, Alex Lawson, here:<br><br>Angela Rayner, the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, and Louise Haigh, the transport secretary, announced on Monday that ministers had approved London City airport’s application to expand.<br><br>The airport submitted a proposal to increase capacity from 6.5 million to 9 million passengers a year by putting on more weekend and early morning flights. Greenpeace said the approval “undermines the UK’s climate leadership” and would “mostly benefit an elite of wealthy frequent fliers”.<br><br>The i reports that ministers are open to more applications for airport expansions. The outlet reports:<br><br>i understands that the government is willing to listen to any approach from airports to expand, but they will have to meet a set of “clear tests” on air quality, noise pollution and providing wider economic benefit...<br><br>Any expansion will also have to ensure that the UK still meets its climate change obligations.<br><br>The government’s stance has raised fresh questions over the expansion of Heathrow and its plans to build a third runway.<br><br>It is likely to encourage Manchester Airports Group (MAG), which owns Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands Airports, and has plans to spend £2bn to expand passenger numbers across its sites over the next five years. Gatwick is also hoping to double its capacity to 78m passengers.<br><br>There have been warnings that ministers will struggle to prepare for next month’s early release of thousands of prisoners.<br><br>Up to 2,000 prisoners are expected to be released in the second week of September as part of an early release scheme, called SDS40, which will allow many prisoners to walk from prison after serving 40% of their sentences.<br><br>A second tranche of up to 1,700 prisoners, all jailed for more than five years, are expected to be freed in late October to relieve pressure on overcrowded prisons.<br><br>While successive governments have invested into recruiting new staff to the probation service, there is not much sign of this activity paying off, with the latest Ministry of Justice data showing there were 178 fewer probation officers over the last quarter.<br><br>Speaking this morning to the Today programme, the chief inspector of probation, Martin Jones, said that staffing levels and excessive caseloads could cause problems for the overstretched and under-resourced probation service.<br><br>“We know that good probation practice keeps communities safe and reduces reoffending, but they need the staff and the resources to do that,” Jones said.<br><br>“At the moment, I fear that the caseload is too high to do that well enough in all cases and that is something I think will require urgent attention going forward.”<br><br>The government has announced emergency measures to tackle prison overcrowding, including early release for some non-violent offenders. But will probation services be able to manage?HM Chief Inspector of Probation Martin Jones says the service has &#x27;a fighting chance&#x27;.#R4Today pic.twitter.com/x4PCkzmFgv</p>

    <p>He also said:<br><br>The probation service doesn’t have the probation officers it needs to deliver its core caseload and therefore what you see is probation officers with excessive caseloads. There is a limit therefore as to what you can properly do as a result of that.<br><br>If you are looking to release somebody from prison, a most important thing is to understand the risk that person represents. Are they a high risk offender or are they a low risk offender? What are their needs? Do they have mental health difficulty? Do they have drug addiction problems?<br><br>If you do not understand that at the point that person is released, it’s a recipe for failure and quite often will result in recall to prison or increased reoffending.<br><br>The Conservative party headquarters is offering free conference passes to former Tory MPs who lost their seats at the general election, in a break from the usual practice, PoliticsHome reports.<br><br>The annual gathering is due to be held in Birmingham from 29 September to 2 October. It will be the first major Conservative party event since the Labour landslide in July.<br><br>The conference will cost a regular Tory member either £66 or £242 to attend, depending on when they apply for their passes.<br><br>💥New w/ @TaliFraserRishi Sunak to offer free party conference passes to former Tory MPs who lost their seats Tory spox: “We look forward welcoming them... as we continue to build a party ready for the future”Many ex-MPs are undecided on whether to attend<br><br>Attendees who aren’t parliamentarians are usually charged an entrance fee, but PoliticsHome is reporting that former Conservative MPs who lost their seats at the general election will be allowed to go for free this time.<br><br>A Conservative party spokesperson said:<br><br>We are committed to drawing on the expertise and talent in our party in helping us rebuild – and that includes our former MPs.<br><br>We look forward welcoming them alongside other party members at our conference in Birmingham this year, as we continue to build a party ready for the future.<br><br>Kemi Badenoch, the shadow housing and communities secretary, is the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Rishi Sunak as party leader and leader of the opposition. She entered the Conservative leadership race last month with a pledge to get the Tories back into government by 2030.<br><br>Tory MPs will reduce the candidate list to four in time for keynote speeches at the October party conference. Then members will decide between the final two contenders.<br><br>As we mentioned in the opening summary, over the next six months, Labour has said it aims to achieve “the highest rate of removals of those with no right to be here” since Theresa May’s premiership in 2018.<br><br>Staff are being redeployed to increase the removal of refused asylum seekers, which has dropped by 40% since 2010, the Home Office said.<br><br>In reaction to the announcement, Dr Peter Walsh, a senior researcher at the Migration Observatory, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:<br><br>If we look at enforced removals, last year there were 6,000 and in 2018 there were 9,000 - so this would require 3,000 more, a 50% increase, which sounds achieveable.<br><br>The other thing to point out is that 2018 is not a particularly high bar, apart from the pandemic that was the lowest number of enforced removals in 20 years.<br><br>The Refugee Council has said that 36,000 asylum seekers are still living in unsuitable hotel rooms, at a cost of £5.3m each day.<br><br>On Monday, more than 200 people came to the UK via small boats – taking the total for the year to just under 20,000.<br><br>Enver Solomon, of the Refugee Council, called for ministers to “look at state of the detention system” and said the Home Office should treat people with respect and humanity when supporting them to return to their home countries (if possible).<br><br>He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that “security matters to stop the boats and no-one wants the people smugglers to profit”.<br><br>Describing those who come as “families” and “ men, women and children”, he added:<br><br>They come here because they are refugees, seeking safety. Unless the government also provide safe routes, it won’t succeed in stopping the boats. Detention is costly. It results in people harming themselves. It results in huge damage to people’s mental health. The government shouldn’t be investing in detention.<br><br>Labour’s approach to immigration in the wake of the far-right protests earlier this month will be a politically delicate issue for Cooper, with many on the party’s left wary of embracing a position that appears to toughen its rhetoric.<br><br>Good morning and welcome back to our rolling coverage of UK politics.<br><br>Yvette Cooper has indicated she will press ahead with the previous government’s plan to reopen two immigration centres in an attempt to achieve the highest rate of removals since Theresa May’s premiership.<br><br>The home secretary announced the Border Security Command “is gearing up” after the number of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats exceeded 19,000 this year so far. The plans include 100 more new intelligence officers to target people smuggling gangs.<br><br>The Labour government has pledged “290 added immigration removals” beds at Campsfield House in Kidlington, Oxfordshire and Haslar in Gosport, Hampshire - centres which had previously closed down in 2019 and 2015.<br><br>Cooper said she plans to achieve the highest rate of deportations since 2018 for refused asylum seekers, and said the Home Office will launch a new intelligence-driven illegal working programme to target employers who hire people with no right to be in the UK.<br><br>So far there have been nine returns flights in the last six weeks, including the largest-ever chartered return flight, the Home Office said. The Conservatives said Labour were “not serious about tackling the people smugglers or stopping the boats”.<br><br>Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council charity, meanwhile, has urged the government to support failed asylum seekers to return voluntarily, and said that the government needs to provide safe routes as a way to stop the boats.
