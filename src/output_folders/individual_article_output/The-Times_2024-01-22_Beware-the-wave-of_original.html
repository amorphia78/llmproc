    <p>It sounds like the start of a laboured joke. What allegedly links the ex-head of MI6, an obscure Cambridge historian, a marquess, a major general and a publishing tycoon? Well, for one thing, their emails were stolen by a Russian hacking operation. Carefully parsed by journalists at Computer Weekly, those leaked emails reveal a misfiring conspiracy among the pro-Brexit British establishment.<br><br>Mobilised by Sir Richard Dearlove (MI6) and Gwythian Prins (Cambridge), the network’s schemes included “hiring ex-MI6 operatives to spy on ‘remainers’, [and] running a ‘mole’ in the civil service”. Only through dark political arts could Brexit be secured and the Chinese Communist Party be banished from Britain.<br><br>Dearlove and Prins’s influence campaign combined covert operations, public advocacy and private lobbying. Though the campaign’s leaders had access to senior Conservative ministers and sent regular briefings to No 10, they reportedly “struggled to translate their access to policymakers into influence”. The group just about managed to place op-eds in sympathetic newspapers.<br><br>The Russian hacking group who stole the messages claimed that they added up to a deep-state coup. But what they actually revealed, as Computer Weekly put it, was “more Dad’s Army” than deep state; more Mick Herron than Ian Fleming.<br><br>Everybody involved in this failed Banana Kingdom plot was a retired septuagenarian. What really linked these men, apart from their crankishly paranoid politics, was their advanced age. Increasingly in Britain, radical politics and retirees find each other the way sharks find blood.<br><br>Retirement used to be an invitation to the golf course or to volunteer at a National Trust property. Retirees “got by” on their state pension. They didn’t dare eat pasta, because like my late grandmother they believed it was somehow “foreign”. Radical politics was for the young. Every revolution in history started as the brainfart of twenty-something underemployed pamphleteers in cheap cafés.<br><br>No longer. The roles of old and young have reversed. Peel the skin off every radical political movement of the past decade and you will find age, not youth, flowing through its veins. In Scotland, where SNP members seriously believed Alex Salmond’s claims that £1.5 trillion of untapped oil and gas reserves would float the country into a glorious post-Union future, 40 per cent of the members were over the age of 60.<br><br>A few years later a poll showed that grassroots Tories (you can guess their age) would have happily sacrificed that Union for Brexit. Even Corbynism, which was supposedly charged by the electricity of a digital “youthquake”, was a revolt of the elderly: half of new party members during Corbyn’s spell as leader were over the age of 55.<br><br>Radical pensioners were the lifeblood of Extinction Rebellion. The movement was defined not by students but by pensioners with too much time on their hands. Just Stop Oil, ER’s successor, has the same greying foot-soldiers. Attending any trial of its members is revealing. You look at the defendants, activists who glued themselves to national highways, expecting to see students with nose piercings and instead see cardigan-wearing pensioners. JSO activists who’ve been processed by the courts include a 76-year-old grandmother who climbed on to an M25 gantry. Her co-defendants last year were aged 72, 65 and 56.</p>

    <p>It would take a serious sociologist and a disregard for certain political niceties to work out why so many industries in Britain — publishing, academia, media, tech and finance come to mind — have made such big bets on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) since the death of George Floyd in May 2020. One undervalued reason may be that the people making decisions in those industries are getting on a bit. A generation raised on Street Fighting Man and half-remembered student protests saw the social justice movements of the late 2010s as a last shot at making their ideals a reality.<br><br>Older people are becoming a larger proportion of the population. In 1990 the percentage of people over the age of 65 was about 16 per cent; today it is closer to 20 per cent. The Office for National Statistics is forecasting that 25 per cent of the population will be over 65 by 2050. We tend to view this silver wave as an unsettling problem for the NHS and social care services, or to moan about the wealth pensioners have stored up in their homes. But some of the most profound consequences will be political.<br><br>With time to kill and decades ahead of them, pensioners will be well placed to attend rallies, organise strikes and contrive plots. Splenetic pensioners pushed the Conservative Party rightwards after Brexit. Sir Keir Starmer’s remarkably under-reported “mission document” for the next government boasts of plans to devolve “decision-making away from Westminster to those with the experience, knowledge and expertise”.<br><br>Starmer and some of his senior advisers are known to be interested in using citizens’ assemblies to cut through knotty issues. I’m sure they imagine that these bodies will be progressive. The likelihood is that they will be stuffed with the kinds of activists who have made JSO such an appealing part of public life. Nobody in their thirties and forties is going to have time to sit around on citizens’ assemblies. They will be gerontocratic institutions, in a nation where the old are growing ever more radical. Be wary of giving them more power than they deserve.<br><br>Will Lloyd is a commissioning editor and writer at the New Statesman</p>
