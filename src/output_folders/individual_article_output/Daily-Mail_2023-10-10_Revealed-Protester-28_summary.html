    <p>The protester who ambushed Keir Starmer at the Labour Conference is an Extinction Rebellion eco-zealot who describes himself as &#x27;a little bit of a weird one&#x27;.<br><br>Yaz Ashmawi, 28, was seen tipping glitter over Sir Keir just before he prepared to give the speech of his career to his supporters.<br><br>The black confetti looked to have alarmed the politician as Ashmawi yelled incoherently: &#x27;We demand a people&#x27;s house. We are in crisis, we are in crisis. Our whole future is in jeopardy&#x27;.<br><br>He was taken out of the conference hall to a Merseyside Police van and arrested.<br><br>JSO also shared footage of the stage-invasion linking it to their demand that Sir Keir &#x27;commits to revoking the oil and gas licences granted by this zombie Tory government&#x27;.<br><br>Ashmawi - who has his own website - describes himself as an Extinction Rebellion strategist and has acted as their spokesman. He claims to be a physicist with a particular interest in the study of entropy.</p>

    <p><br><br>Ashmawi, who is from Surrey, says on his website: &#x27;Sup, hi, hello, I&#x27;m a little bit of a weird one. I work on physics a lot of the time, with particular interest in a quantity called entropy.&#x27;<br><br>He certainly appears to be something of a globe-trotter, which may be at odds with his climate concerns.<br><br>A political splinter group with links to XR and Just Stop Oil, called People Demand Democracy, claimed responsibility for the incident, saying they are a &#x27;new group calling for an upgrade to the UK political system using civil disobedience&#x27;.<br><br>After being showered in glitter, Sir Keir was cheered as he took off his jacket and continued after the man was removed saying: &#x27;If he thinks that bothers me he doesn&#x27;t know me.&#x27;<br><br>The incident raises questions about the Labour leader&#x27;s personal protection and security at the conference on Merseyside.</p>
