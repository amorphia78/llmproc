    <p>The future of protesting is fabulous, darling. In a world of increased police surveillance, activists are turning to face paints to stop AI facial recognition software picking them out of a crowd.<br><br>Activist artists in the Greenpeace area of Glastonbury festival held a workshop to teach the foundations of how to cause a glitch in facial recognition software — a tactic known as “face breaking” or “computer vision (CV) dazzle”.<br><br>As the government looks into banning face coverings at protests — which have been widely used since the Covid pandemic and recently particularly by pro-Palestine groups — CV dazzle could provide an alternative way for activists to go unrecognised.<br><br>The concept is based on dazzle camouflage used by Royal Navy ships during the First World War, which used high-contrast colours and sloping lines to distort the structure of a vessel and disguise the direction of travel.<br><br>• Glastonbury 2025 live: Rod Stewart and Olivia Rodrigo set to headline<br><br>Michelle Tylicki, an artist and activist, explained to attendees at the “apocalypse museum” workshop that CV dazzle combines stylised makeup, and sometimes hair design, to break up detectable facial patterns recognised by computer vision algorithms. This either confuses the technology into mapping the wrong parts of the face or leads it to conclude there is no face to map.<br><br>She said: “The most important thing is that it’s asymmetrical because algorithms love symmetry and if you break that then it will be confused with what it’s looking at. You can apply shapes and colours and lines in unusual directions that are high-contrast for your skin tone and really break it so it’s in different directions.”<br><br>Tylicki added: “Using bold contrasts and obstructing key facial features especially in the nose bridge area … there is so much of our data of our faces just there, so if you cover that part up with lots of sparkly things, make high-contrast weird stuff in that part, that is really confusing for cameras.<br><br>“Light refraction, like sparkles, is really confusing for cameras. It’s unusual for skin to have that going on, so loads of diamonds.”<br><br>The tactic has been employed at various protests, including some in the UK. Tylicki said that she first came across the concept during a protest in Germany where hundreds of activists invaded a coal mine.<br><br>“It was a mass arrest of about a thousand people, which we were prepared for and we did this to our faces and they did mugshots of us but I haven’t heard back from the German police since,” she said.<br><br>After these basic instructions the workshop attendees dipped brushes in face paint and eyeshadow, and glued glitter, googly-eyes and sequins on each other’s faces to distort mappable features such as the eyes, nose and chin.</p>

    <p>Tylicki offered suggestions — for example, to use fewer symmetrical shapes, disguise the jawline or add high-contrast colours. Then she checked the effectiveness of the face paint using an Instagram face filter.<br><br>She explained: “Instagram face filters are kind of the same technology as street-level CCTV cameras. Obviously our phones have Lidar that scans 3D — that’s a whole other thing, but most police and corporate scanning is more primitive still, luckily.”<br><br>Most attendees from the festival needed several attempts to create a design that fools the facial recognition technology. However, every person who managed the feat received a round of applause.<br><br>According to Tylicki, such “tools of resistance” have become important as the government hopes to push the Crime and Policing Bill through parliament — which would make it illegal to wear face coverings at protests.<br><br>She said: “Policing and advertising have both recently accelerated the use of facial recognition. Police employ facial recognition vans and began a trial of fixed facial recognition cameras for a ‘zone of safety’ in Croydon this summer. The number of police face scans doubled between 2023-24 to 4.7 million.”<br><br>The modern concept of dazzle camouflage is credited to the artist Adam Harvey, who coined the term “CV dazzle” when experimenting how to break facial recognition software for his master’s thesis in 2013.<br><br>Tom Drew, head of national security at Faculty AI, which provides artificial intelligence software, said face paint can “prevent facial recognition via 2D texture-based computer vision models”.<br><br>However, he said AI is emerging that is resilient to such tactics.<br><br>He said: “Firstly you can adversarially train 2D facial-texture models against techniques like CV Dazzle. In simple terms this is achieved by showing a machine-learning model a lot of examples of those high-contrast patterns over a nose, for example, and telling the model ‘this is still a nose’. And with enough data, models can recognise such feature distortion.<br><br>“The other field that is growing in popularity — as your speaker recognises — is in 3D facial recognition, which measures the geometry of the face. So as opposed to focusing on surface texture and patterns, like 2D models do, these reconstruct a depth map of the face which is resilient to the visual tricks in 2D RGB [red, green and blue] space that CV Dazzle exploits.<br><br>“3D facial recognition models have the added benefit of being able to detect spoofing — which might be an indicator of illegal or bad actor activity.”</p>
