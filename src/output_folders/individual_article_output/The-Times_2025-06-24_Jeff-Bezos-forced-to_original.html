    <p>Activists in Venice protesting against Jeff Bezos’s star-studded wedding in the city this week are claiming victory after the Amazon mogul was forced to cancel his use of a venue and switch to a better-protected location.<br><br>Bezos’s plan to party at a 16th-century hall in the centre of Venice during his three-day bash was called off after protesters threatened to leap into the canals around the venue with inflatable crocodiles to stop guests arriving.<br><br>“Bezos is on the run — this is a crazy victory for a small group of people with no money who went up against one of the richest men on the planet,” Tommaso Cacciari, a leading protester, said.<br><br>In another change to the wedding schedule, Bezos will no longer bring his superyacht Koru, or its support ship the Abeona, to the lagoon city, The Times has learnt.<br><br>Both vessels are moored at the Croatian island of Unije, close to Venice, and were due to make a big entrance to the city. The 417ft Koru is one of the largest yachts in the world, while the 246ft Abeona has space for a landing pad for the helicopter flown by Bezos’a bride to be Lauren Sanchez.<br><br>Among the 200 reported guests arriving for the couple’s wedding are President Trump’s children Don Jnr and Ivanka, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, the singer Katy Perry and Bill Gates.<br><br>Guests are due to fly in on 95 private jets with airports in Venice and nearby Treviso and Verona all used to avoid disruptions to normal air traffic, Corriere della Sera reported on Monday.<br><br>Protesters accuse Bezos of arrogantly shutting down Venice for a private event and are also attacking him for his labour practices and allegedly low tax bill.<br><br>Before the festivities, Greenpeace and a British group called Everyone hates Elon laid out a huge banner in St Mark’s Square on Monday reading “If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax” over a photo of Bezos.<br><br>• Bezos’s wedding would be better in Beverly Hills, says abbot<br><br>“As governments talk about hard choices and struggle to fund public services, Jeff Bezos can afford to shut down half a city for days on end just to get married,” a statement from Everyone hates Elon said.</p>

    <p>Bezos is expected to arrive in Venice on his superyacht and get the festivities started on Thursday with a gathering on the beach at the Lido, the strip of land protecting the Venice lagoon from the Adriatic.<br><br>The party moves on the next day to a tiny island, San Giorgio Maggiore, opposite St Mark’s Square, where a concert may be held in an open air amphitheatre.<br><br>The final party was to have been held on Saturday at the Scuola Grande di Santa Maria della Misericordia, a huge hall easily reached by foot or water.<br><br>Cacciari said the event had been moved to one of the halls at Venice’s former shipyard — the Arsenale — which were once used for sail-making and are known as Le Tese.<br><br>“You cannot approach by foot, it’s much easier to keep people away,” he said. “We won’t try to protest there — there is no sense following a man when he is on the run,” he added.<br><br>Not all Venetians are opposed to the wedding. A group of businesses and hoteliers called Yes Venice Can has said they were proud that Bezos had picked the city and were “indignant” over protests by “a few small groups”.<br><br>• The Bezos wedding: what Venetians really think, by a local resident<br><br>They said: “We won’t allow a noisy minority to discredit Venice before the world,” adding that no one protested when the actor George Clooney married in the city in 2014.<br><br>It emerged at the weekend that Bezos had donated a million euros to Corila, an organisation that protects the fragile environment of the Venice lagoon, as well donating to a Venetian university and the local Unesco office.<br><br>“Talks about the donation started in April and they gave us a free hand about what to use the money for,” Pierpaolo Campostrini, Corila’s director, said. “This donation is not about quietening protests, it’s a gesture of love for Venice and its future.”</p>
