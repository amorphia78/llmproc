    <p>Greta Thunberg was detained twice by Dutch police during a protest over fossil fuel in The Hague. Video footage shows the moment two burly cops dumped the climate activist on a coach.<br><br>The incident happened on Saturday after Thunberg and a group of marchers blocked a main road in a protest organised by the Extinction Rebellion group. She had joined hundreds of protesters on a walk down from The Hague&#x27;s city centre to the A12 arterial highway that connects the seat of the Dutch government with other cities including Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht.<br><br>Dozens of police officers, including some on horseback, blocked the group from accessing the motorway, warning that &#x27;violence could be used&#x27; should the marchers try to get onto the road. They were carrying environmental group flags and placards saying &#x27;Stop fuel subsidies now!&#x27; and &#x27;The planet is dying!&#x27;.<br><br>The chanting protesters were then locked in a tense standoff with police who formed a wall of law enforcement. Thunberg joined in with the chants and slogans during the protest.</p>

    <p><br><br>&#x27;It&#x27;s important to demonstrate today because we are living in a state of planetary emergency,&#x27; Thunberg told AFP as police blocked marchers. &#x27;We must do everything to avoid that crisis and to save human lives,&#x27; she said.<br><br>Some activists found another route and blocked a main road close to the highway where they - including Thunberg - sat down on the tarmac. Asked whether she was concerned about police action and arrest, Thunberg said: &#x27;Why should I be?&#x27;<br><br>Thunberg was arrested and dragged away by police to a waiting touring bus where she was detained with other activists. She told the ANP national news agency by telephone that her arrest had proceeded &#x27;calmly&#x27;. &#x27;It&#x27;s not about the arrest. I am here for the climate,&#x27; she said.<br><br>A spokesman for the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office confirmed the protesters were briefly detained before being released.</p>
