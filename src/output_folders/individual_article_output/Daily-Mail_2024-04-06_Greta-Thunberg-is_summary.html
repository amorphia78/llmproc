    <p>PRIMARY: Greta Thunberg and hundreds of protesters blocked a main road and traffic intersection in The Hague, organized by Extinction Rebellion. They carried placards demanding &quot;Stop fuel subsidies now!&quot; and protested the government&#x27;s delay in implementing fossil fuel subsidy cuts until 2030-2035. Thunberg was arrested twice and briefly detained before being released without charges.<br><br>SECONDARY: The protest was part of a broader European campaign involving 30 movements from 15 countries, with simultaneous actions in 10 European countries and planned future blockades including May 4 actions.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article focuses on the Dutch government&#x27;s slow implementation of fossil fuel subsidy cuts despite parliamentary and popular support, and the $7 trillion global fossil fuel subsidies according to IMF.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral tone, factually reporting the arrests while giving voice to both police warnings and activist justifications.</p>
