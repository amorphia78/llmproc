    <p>Furious fans have asked whether Gary Lineker &#x27;will be eating crisps next&#x27; live on air after he was alleged to have broken BBC guidelines by appearing to wear his own range of Next menswear during England&#x27;s opening Euros game.<br><br>Lineker was dressed in a pale green T-shirt and sage jacket while presenting coverage of the England vs Serbia game to nearly 15 million viewers on Sunday night.<br><br>It looks identical to a £16 T-shirt and £55 jacket he is pictured advertising on Next&#x27;s website.<br><br>BBC guidelines state that presenters should not &#x27;appear on-air wearing clothing or using products or services which they have agreed/been contracted to promote, advertise or endorse or in which they have a specific financial interest&#x27;.<br><br>It has sparked fury from some viewers with one sarcastically asking if he will be eating crisps next in a nod to him famously once being the face of Walkers.<br><br>Others accused the BBC of being too weak and saying it probably won&#x27;t punish their £1.35million-a-year star.<br><br>Lineker often sports a casual look when he presents Match of the Day opting for dark-coloured open-collared shirts, but he has rarely been seen wearing T-shirts live on air before.<br><br>The former England striker usually goes for a more formal look of a full suit and tie when presenting finals, such as when Manchester United faced Manchester City in the FA Cup final in May.<br><br>Lineker has previously spoken about not being able to wear green and white clothing while presenting MOTD as &#x27;the cameras can&#x27;t cope&#x27; due to the studio&#x27;s green screen background.<br><br>But the broadcaster&#x27;s wardrobe has been set loose during the corporation&#x27;s Euro 2024 coverage with a windowed studio being set up in Berlin near the city&#x27;s iconic Brandenburg Gate.<br><br>MailOnline has contacted Lineker&#x27;s representatives for comment.<br><br>Lineker launched his clothing line with the high street retailer in 2023 and models for the range online.<br><br>BBC rules stipulate that presenters should declare any deals or endorsements to promote clothing.<br><br>MailOnline understands BBC Sports presenters wear their own clothes and are regularly reminded of the broadcaster&#x27;s guidelines.<br><br>Speaking to The Guardian in April last year, Lineker said he always wears his own clothes when presenting MOTD with the only directive being &#x27;to go for casual&#x27;.<br><br>Asked if there was anything he had to avoid wearing, he said: &#x27;Match of the Day is a green screen so it&#x27;s like a virtual reality show. You can&#x27;t wear green, you can&#x27;t wear white, you can&#x27;t wear patterns. That means it&#x27;s unbelievably restrictive. The cameras can&#x27;t cope. You&#x27;ve basically got plain dark colours, or light blue.&#x27;<br><br>Lineker was also in trouble with animal rights activists PETA over the Next collection, after modelling a mohair jacket, which the organisation said is &#x27;made from the hair of abused goats&#x27;.<br><br>Previously, the Match of the Day Host got into hot water during the 2018 World Cup for promoting a TM Lewin shirt on Instagram that he wore on-air after becoming the face of the clothing brand.<br><br>The BBC branded it a &#x27;genuine mistake&#x27; after they acknowledged it breached company guidelines.<br><br>Mr Lineker told OK! Magazine: &#x27;I&#x27;ve always got my own clothes and I&#x27;ve always dressed myself on television.

We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries.<br><br>&#x27;This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s, and I&#x27;m out of order?&#x27;<br><br>In February last year, he appeared to mock Rishi Sunak&#x27;s landmark EU deal over Northern Ireland, while he also shared a video calling for illegal immigrants arriving on small boats to be granted citizenship - and blamed Brexit for delays at the airport.<br><br>In January last year, he retweeted a post calling Ms Braverman utterly devoid of sensibility&#x27; after her exchange with a Holocaust survivor.<br><br>And in 2022, he criticised the Tories and former PM Liz Truss, sparked a row about pumping sewage into the sea, and defended Just Stop Oil protesters who stormed the British Grand Prix.<br><br>Lineker&#x27;s outbursts date back a long way, including in 2016 when he tweeted: &#x27;The treatment by some towards these young refugees is hideously racist.&#x27;<br><br>Following the backlash, Mr Lineker tweeted: &#x27;Getting a bit of a spanking today, but things could be worse – imagine, just for a second, being a refugee having to flee from your home.&#x27;<br><br>When someone replied saying they hoped he would lose his job because he &#x27;deserved it&#x27;, Lineker hit back, saying: &#x27;I won&#x27;t&#x27;.<br><br>Two years later, he appeared to slam the Tories again, who at the time were holding a no-confidence vote in former PM Theresa May.<br><br>&#x27;Extraordinary to watch us take our country back and rip it to shreds in the process,&#x27; he wrote in one tweet, before later retweeting David Cameron&#x27;s calls for the Conservatives to back Mrs May, which Lineker shared with crying-with-laughter emojis.<br><br>It sparked fellow BBC Sport broadcaster Jonathan Agnew to say he would &#x27;be sacked&#x27; if he followed Lineker&#x27;s example on social media.</p>
