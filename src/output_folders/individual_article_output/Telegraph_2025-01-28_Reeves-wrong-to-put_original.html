        <h1>Reeves wrong to put growth before net zero, says major Labour donor</h1><h2>Dale Vince says investing in UK’s green economy is the only route to sustainable growth</h2><p>Rachel Reeves would be “foolish” to put growth before net zero and approve expansion at Britain’s major airports, a major Labour donor has warned.<br><br>Dale Vince, the eco-tycoon who has given £5m to the party, said it would be a mistake for the Chancellor to back a third runway at Heathrow and similar extensions at Gatwick and Luton.<br><br>More flying risked driving up the country’s carbon emissions and “wiping out” progress made in other areas, such as Ed Miliband’s plans for a clean power system, he argued. Climate change itself also poses a serious risk to the economy, he said.<br><br>However, Mr Vince told The Telegraph: “The three runways at Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton, between them, will wipe out all of the carbon savings of getting to 100pc green on the grid.<br><br>“It’s clearly wrong to say we’ll put growth before carbon emissions, because – my word – it will impair our drive to net zero so considerably.<br><br>“We won’t get there by anything like the target date that we have, because we’ll have decarbonised the grid but absolutely wiped that out with new runways to allow for more planes to fly in and out of Britain. And we just don’t need that. There’s no major economic growth to come from doing that.”<br><br>The multimillionaire’s comments come after Ms Reeves said growth was the Government’s number one priority, signalling that she is prepared to take on opponents who say airport expansion should be blocked on environmental grounds.<br><br>Sir Keir Starmer has also announced a new growth assessment that will allow him to veto policies if they damage the economy.<br><br>Mr Vince argued that prioritising net zero would protect the economy. He pointed to new figures from insurer Munich Re showing that the world collectively suffered $320bn (£258bn) worth of damage from extreme weather events last year but less than half was insured.<br><br>“That cost is rising, incredibly,” Mr Vince said. “It was doubled on the year before, and it’s going to keep going up. So the idea that a few runways will bring us some growth that we can hang on to is foolish, because if we don’t get on top of net zero, that will all be washed away – no amount of runways will save our economy from the effects of the climate crisis. It’s an illusion.<br><br>“The real growth, the sustainable growth, is in the green economy, and getting our emissions down.”<br><br>Asked whether he would stop supporting Labour in the event airport expansions were approved, Mr Vince said he “cared about” the issue but that it was not a deal-breaker, adding that he “disagreed with Labour on a number of things” such as nuclear power and heat pumps.</p>

    <p>He said: “If they go ahead with Heathrow, I’ll be against that as well.<br><br>“I thought it was most important we had a Labour government after 14 years of Tory misrule and corruption, and I thought we had a historic opportunity to elect a government that got the green economy.<br><br>“I still think we have a government that gets that. So they’re making mistakes in some areas, but you can’t have everything in life that you’d like to.”<br><br>Mr Vince, who boasts a £100m fortune and is known as “Britain’s richest hippie”, has become one of Labour’s biggest donors after handing the party £5m.<br><br>He has also in the past donated to climate protest groups Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, although he withdrew financial support for the former after claiming it had become too extreme.<br><br>Suggestion that the Chancellor is poised to publicly back a third runway at Heathrow has already sparked division within Labour.<br><br>Sir Sadiq Khan, the London Mayor, and Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Manchester, have both signalled they will oppose expansion.<br><br>Mr Miliband, the Energy Secretary, has also previously opposed plans for a third runway. However, he played down speculation of a Cabinet split on issue last week when he told journalists it would be “ridiculous” to resign over the issue.<br><br>Further expansion of Britain’s biggest airports is also expected to draw fierce resistance from green campaigners, with reduced emissions from air travel still a key part of the Government’s plan to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.<br><br>The Climate Change Committee, the powerful quango in charge of advising the Government on how to reduce carbon emissions, has previously warned that airport expansion is incompatible with the UK’s net zero commitments.<br><br>Mr Miliband acknowledged growing pressure for an easing of the rules on Monday when speaking to the environmental audit committee in Parliament.<br><br>“I should be candid to this committee, that the climate consensus at home and abroad in under greater strain than it has been for some time,” he told MPs.<br><br>“There are siren voices in the UK who are saying that we should step back from this agenda, that now is the time to give up on climate action because it is not in our national interest.<br><br>“I want to be incredibly clear with you about this: This Government is not going to do that, we’re not going to heed those siren voices.<br><br>“Why? Because whatever the disinformation, the misinformation, the truth is that climate action is essential for our national self-interest and is supported by the British people.”<br><br>The Treasury has been approached for comment.</p></body></html>
