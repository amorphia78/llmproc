    <p>PRIMARY: Greta Thunberg and about 50 Extinction Rebellion demonstrators blocked a busy junction leading to a motorway in The Hague, protesting against fossil fuels. Police used water cannons and arrested the protesters, including Thunberg. XR activists also blocked roads near government buildings and a motorway lane.<br><br>SECONDARY: Earlier this week, XR had blocked roads during a new cabinet swearing-in ceremony. The group cancelled a planned protest due to weather conditions.</p>
