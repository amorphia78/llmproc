    <p>PRIMARY: Six Just Stop Oil activists (aged 31-70) conducted a slow march across Waterloo Bridge on November 8, charged with interfering with key national infrastructure. They denied charges under the Public Order Act 2023 for allegedly preventing public use of the bridge. Their trial is scheduled for 2025.<br><br>SECONDARY: No secondary protest actions mentioned.<br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The judge relaxed bail conditions for five defendants, allowing them to participate in peaceful protests while prohibiting actions that prevent people from conducting lawful business. The case highlights competing rights between protest and public access.</p>
