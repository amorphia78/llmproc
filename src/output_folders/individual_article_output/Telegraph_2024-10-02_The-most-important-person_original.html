    <p>Behind a black door in the corner of Nina Gold’s office lies a tiny room, not much bigger than a cupboard. It is here that aspiring actors come to audition for Britain’s foremost casting director. Flanking the door are two posters, offering a tantalising promise of the kind of success that might one day await.<br><br>On the left is Claire Foy in The Crown, and on the right are Daisy Ridley and John Boyega in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. All three were Gold’s discoveries, and she has watched their careers like a proud parent.<br><br>‘An element of the job is slightly maternal,’ she says. ‘You just can’t help it, really.’ Some of Britain’s finest acting talents first appeared on Gold’s radar when they were children or drama students. She noted the performances, mentally filing them away.<br><br>Benedict Cumberbatch was a drama school find. ‘Sometimes it’s very obvious that people have incredible talent even if it’s the embryonic version. And Benedict was so unusual, but also just so talented from the very get-go, that it seemed very clear something interesting would happen.’<br><br>Claire Foy was another. ‘I’d seen her from a very early stage and she was so good, so incredibly versatile,’ Gold recalls. Yet it was seven years before she successfully matched Foy to a part, as Anne Boleyn in Wolf Hall. ‘I don’t know if she’d mind me saying this, but until that moment there were so many times when it was almost her.’ Wolf Hall set Foy on her way. A few months later, she was unveiled as the young Queen Elizabeth II.<br><br>Then there is Aaron Taylor-Johnson, now one half of a creative power couple with his wife, artist and film-maker Sam Taylor-Johnson. ‘I first met Aaron when he was 10. We cast him when he was about 11. So I’ve known him since before he was in his teens, and now he’s married to my best friend.’ She laughs: ‘But that’s a coincidence.’<br><br>If you don’t work in the industry, you may not have heard of Gold. But her influence is everywhere. Look at the credits of the most prestigious TV series – Slow Horses, Chernobyl, Wolf Hall, Game of Thrones – and you’ll see her name. She cast Jessica Gunning as the crazed stalker in Baby Reindeer, which became the most talked-about performance of the year.<br><br>Her film work includes Paddington and The King’s Speech, Les Misérables and The Iron Lady. Gold is as good with Hollywood blockbusters as with arthouse cinema: her lengthy CV features several Star Wars films and spin-offs, and seven films by Mike Leigh.<br><br>Her touch is so sure that Game of Thrones fans had a saying to greet the announcement of new cast members: ‘In Nina We Trust.’ The makers of the show, David Benioff and DB Weiss, have said that ‘it is impossible to imagine the show without her’. When Gold was honoured with a Bafta special award in 2016, Leigh gave her his highest praise in a video tribute: ‘She is, and this is quite unique amongst casting directors, completely devoid of bulls--t.’<br><br>Ask Gold about the secret of her success, and she replies in vague terms. It is all about collaboration, she says, and ‘ultimately, all you’ve got is the ability to go with your instincts, because there’s no analytical way of really doing it.’<br><br>She is modest, telling me how thrilled she is that Gunning and Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd won Emmys last month, while not mentioning the fact that she won one herself for outstanding casting.<br><br>But others spell it out. ‘She has an encyclopaedic knowledge of established and new talent and can often see a performance in someone that requires a leap of faith in the rest of us. She’s rarely wrong,’ says Jay Hunt, the Apple TV+ boss who worked with Gold to bring Slow Horses to the screen, starring Gary Oldman as the slovenly spy boss. ‘She is a truly formidable talent in the casting world. And I’m still humbled by how often I hear her reading with an actor in auditions.’<br><br>Paul King, who directed the first two Paddington films and worked with Gold again on Wonka, sings her praises. ‘Nina is incredibly hard-working. She’s always looking for the best person for the part. It might be the obvious choice, the big movie star, but it might equally be a departure for an actor established in one sort of role but she can imagine them in another. And it might be someone you’ve never heard of who she somehow knows is going to be great.<br><br>‘She’s also great at putting people together. I always want my casts to feel like they are friends off screen, like they all hang out together and make each other laugh. And she has an astonishing sense of which actors will work well with each other, which pairs could be couples, and which pairs could be mortal enemies.’<br><br>At the moment, Gold has two films set for release: Conclave, a papal thriller based on the Robert Harris novel and starring Ralph Fiennes; and Blitz, from the director Steve McQueen, about a nine-year-old Second World War evacuee who attempts to make it back to his mother. Gold found the lead, newcomer Elliott Heffernan, during a trawl of London primary schools.<br><br>Gold’s maternal instincts are in overdrive for her latest project, a remake of Lord of the Flies which is currently in production. According to film lore, the children who appeared in the 1963 adaptation went so feral during the shoot on an island off Puerto Rico that a visiting Life magazine journalist observed one of them feeding live lizards into a rotating fan. Presumably, duty-of-care standards are higher on this new version? ‘They take a lot of care,’ Gold reassures me. ‘But they’ve still got 30 small children all bunched together on an island in Malaysia. I think they’re mainly having a great time.’<br><br>For the BBC production, adapted for television by Jack Thorne, Gold’s team toured the nation’s drama groups and contacted more than 1,000 schools in their search for boys. They also put out a casting call on social media, inviting children to submit a 30-second video of themselves talking about what they would take to a desert island. ‘It was just a way to get a feel of them, to hear them talking,’ Gold explains.<br><br>Joel Wilson, one of the drama’s executive producers, says Gold ‘spots things that other people don’t. There were a few instances in this where a child would come in and not necessarily make the best first impression in terms of their performance but she would say, “No, they’ve got something, I want to bring them back in.”<br><br>‘She’s very bold and, in a sort of friendly and kind way, quite forceful when she feels something, which is actually what you want from someone who’s in that position. These things are so subjective, but everything she’s pushed for has been completely right.’<br><br>Gold is particularly enamoured by David McKenna, a cherubic 12-year-old from Northern Ireland who has been cast as Piggy. ‘He is so, so fabulous,’ she says. ‘And he was a last-minute find. We did the outreach on social media and David came from that.’ A child from an ordinary background, he will be making his professional debut in Lord of the Flies.<br><br>Some of the boys have more of an acting pedigree (twins Noah and Cassius Flemyng are the sons of actor Jason Flemyng) or a passing acquaintance with life in the public eye (Cornelius Brandreth, grandson of Gyles). But Gold doesn’t have much truck with the idea of nepo babies, insisting that she only casts on merit. She put Eve Hewson, Bono’s daughter, in Apple TV+ series Bad Sisters but that’s ‘because she’s great. She really didn’t nepo-baby it, she just did it. I mean, I guess the introductions are easier, but that only gets you so far.’<br><br>While part of Gold’s job involves unearthing young talent, the other part involves placing established stars. No, the A-listers don’t have to audition, but that doesn’t mean the process is easy. There are usually several names in the mix. On occasion, Gold will have a particular actor in mind, and the director or producer will have another.<br><br>‘Sometimes people do have thoughts that you somehow know in your bones are not the right thing, and you have to make it go away,’ she says. Does she always succeed? ‘No,’ she replies, then adds with a smile: ‘But often.’<br><br>Gold’s suggestion of Ben Whishaw as the voice of Paddington Bear did not result in an immediate yes. ‘I remember we had a lot of discussion about whether he would sound bear-like enough which, when you say it out loud, sounds completely ridiculous. But we got there together.’<br><br>The one rule is that the stars must never find out that they weren’t first choice. This is a business full of fragile egos. ‘The actors have no idea that all the people who ultimately take all the credit for them spent six weeks saying, “You’ve got to be kidding.” It would just be terrible if they did know! They’d be horrified.’ Diplomacy is one of Gold’s skills.</p>

    <p>Aided by her casting partner Martin Ware, and before that by Robert Sterne, Gold is always busy. Her days are spent meeting agents, directors and producers, or holding auditions; the arrival of the smartphone has democratised this somewhat, because now anyone can ‘self-tape’ at home. At night, she goes to the theatre, on the search for talent.<br><br>The work is wonderfully varied. A recent casting call for a film version of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel Hamnet, which imagines Shakespeare’s family life, called for young men with farming experience. So far, that one hasn’t come off: ‘We didn’t manage it this time, probably because sheep farmers are too busy sheep farming to have time for this showbiz nonsense.’<br><br>The only part of the job she doesn’t enjoy is having to break the news to actors that they haven’t got the role. ‘It’s horrendous. It’s absolutely awful. You just think, “Oh, God…” because you know how horrible it is if something doesn’t go your way, and it happens to them practically every week. Even if they’re really successful, it happens.’<br><br>There are actors she returns to again and again. ‘My brother phoned me up the other day and said, “I saw this film with Jim Broadbent in it and it was really weird that you hadn’t cast it,”’ she laughs. ‘I do completely love Jim Broadbent.’ She also has a particular fondness for George MacKay, star of 1917 and Sunshine on Leith, whom she first met when he was a teenager: ‘I have loved watching him develop into a wonderful actor and an excellent grown-up man.’<br><br>And she adores working with Gillian Anderson, most recently casting her as Emily Maitlis in Scoop. ‘She’s such an incredible character actress even though she’s such a tremendous beauty. She just doesn’t mind anything, no matter how hideous you make her look.’ Not that she was hideous as Maitlis, Gold swiftly clarifies. ‘But we once cast her in this thing called The Crimson Petal and the White and she played this really quite awful madam of the brothel in the most totally un-vain way.’<br><br>Gold cast the first four seasons of The Crown, in which Anderson popped up as Margaret Thatcher. She immersed herself in royal biographies for her research, and still has on her phone a photograph she used as inspiration for the casting of Princess Margaret (played by Vanessa Kirby, and later Helena Bonham Carter), with the glamorous royal wearing a bathing costume and surrounded by friends on the beach in Mustique.<br><br>Game of Thrones was an even bigger undertaking than The Crown, with a mammoth, ever-changing cast. But surely Gold doesn’t cast every single part in a show of that size? She can’t pay attention to the man who comes on and says one line? ‘I do,’ she says. ‘Because, without wishing to sound like a terrible control freak, if you don’t get that right, it ruins everything. Also, the small parts are harder than the big parts, in a way, because you need really good people who don’t mind doing small parts.’<br><br>On rare occasions, Gold’s decisions have proved controversial. The casting of Amandla Stenberg, a non-binary, mixed-race actor, as the lead in Disney’s Star Wars TV spin-off The Acolyte drew accusations of ‘wokeness’. Stenberg described the online hate she received as ‘intolerable’. Gold says of the internet trolling: ‘It’s just a terrible, terrible rabbit hole that one must never look at. It’s totally unfair and Amandla is a totally brilliant actor and really a star. I’m sure it will fade into yesterday’s news.’<br><br>More complicatedly, Eddie Redmayne has said that it was a mistake for him to play the role of a trans character in 2015 film The Danish Girl, for which Gold did the casting. Gold loves Redmayne – she also cast him as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, a performance that won him an Oscar – and accepts the way he feels. At that time, she says, the world was only just ‘waking up to the fact that there could be an actual trans actor out there’ who could play a lead role.<br><br>But she says: ‘Part of me thinks: do we have to worry about gender quite so much? Why can’t somebody just be a person for a moment? I mean, playing a human is the most important part.’ As for Michael Sheen saying he finds it hard to accept Welsh characters being played by non-Welsh actors, or Russell T Davies saying that gay roles should go to gay actors, she is firm.<br><br>‘The thing is, you have to be a really brilliant actor to play something that’s a million miles away from your own experience, but that’s ultimately the most brilliant and fascinating thing to watch, isn’t it?<br><br>‘When people don’t get it right, then it’s a bit awful. I’m Welsh, I feel very particular about it and lots of people are not that brilliant at Welsh accents. But I’ve got no objection to somebody who can really do it, doing it.<br><br>‘And I know there’s a lot of redressing the balance to be done in the context of gay actors who wouldn’t come out because it might ruin their career in the past, but I still think no actor wants to be told they can only do something that is their own lived experience, including their sexuality, because where’s the fun in that?’<br><br>On colour-blind casting, she is similarly robust. ‘I actually don’t believe there is such a thing as colour-blind casting. You can’t completely divorce it from the political implications. It’s obviously essential that you don’t want everybody to be white in everything but also… I think what you don’t want is a load of white, middle-class, middle-aged executives saying, “Oh, we must remember to put 10 persons of colour in this,” because that’s just completely insane.’<br><br>Increased diversity is one of the changes she has witnessed over her near-30-year career. She fell into the job while at Cambridge University, where she was studying modern and medieval languages, when a friend asked if she could find some extras of her age to appear in an AC/DC video.<br><br>She went on to cast music videos for Tina Turner and Elton John, and then a McDonald’s advert directed by Mike Leigh, who remembered her when he was casting for his film Topsy-Turvy. She started out running the business from her home in Queen’s Park, north-west London, and now has an office a short walk away. It is as un-intimidating as an audition space for actors could be: a friendly team, offers of tea, sometimes a dog asleep by the door.<br><br>The job fit well with early motherhood (‘I did just cart my small children around everywhere for a while’). The children are now in their 20s: her daughter is a teacher, and her son has just started at a music and drama school. Her partner, Frank Hewetson, works for Greenpeace and is currently setting up their office in Ukraine.<br><br>Hewetson was one of the ‘Arctic 30’ activists jailed in Russia in 2013 for attempting to scale a drilling platform in a protest against oil production. Gold joked during her 2016 Bafta acceptance speech that it was ‘traditional at this moment to thank one’s life partner for their unwavering support, but unfortunately mine is normally in prison’.<br><br>That period was obviously ‘pretty unfunny’ in reality, but this dry sense of humour is one of Gold’s trademarks. ‘Nina has a mischievous wit which makes even the most mundane casting conversations amusing,’ says Jay Hunt. When I ask Gold who she would cast as the next James Bond she replies that it is not her problem (another casting director, Debbie McWilliams, has the job). Is she glad not to have that particular stress? Gold bursts out laughing and says: ‘I’d be happy to have that stress if they were paying me.’<br><br>In February, after years of lobbying by the industry, the Oscars announced a new award for achievement in casting, to be included from 2026. ‘We finally won the battle,’ Gold grins. The chances of her adding an Oscar to her pile of awards, which includes six Emmys, are surely high.<br><br>And she will keep surprising people. In Blitz, the little boy’s East End grandfather is played by musician Paul Weller. I didn’t know he was an actor, I say. ‘Nor did anybody, least of all him,’ laughs Gold. ‘He kept saying, “Oh, I don’t know.” But then he said he’d give it a go, and he’s great. He just feels like such an authentic Londoner; he looks like he comes from the past, in the best possible way.’ She thinks for a moment, trying to sum up the intangible art of casting: ‘He just ended up feeling like the guy.’<br><br>Blitz opens the London Film Festival on October 9</p>
