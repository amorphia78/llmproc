    <p>PRIMARY: Five Just Stop Oil protesters (Hannah Taylor, 23; Lydia Gribbin, 28; Hanan Ameur, 22; Noah Crane, 18; and Poppy Bliss, 19) stormed the stage during a West End performance of Les Miserables at London&#x27;s Sondheim Theatre. They unfurled orange Just Stop Oil flags and chained themselves to the stage with bicycle locks, forcing the show to halt and costing the theatre £80,000. The action aimed to raise climate crisis awareness and stop fossil fuel use.<br><br>SECONDARY: Just Stop Oil also covered a dinosaur skeleton at the Natural History Museum in orange powder as part of their climate activism campaign.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The court proceedings focus on the judge refusing to delay the trial when one defendant requested postponement for a trip to India, highlighting potential financial liability for the protesters.<br><br>TONE: The article takes a negative tone toward the protest, emphasizing disruption costs, audience anger, and the judge&#x27;s dismissive response to the defendant&#x27;s travel request.</p></body></html>
