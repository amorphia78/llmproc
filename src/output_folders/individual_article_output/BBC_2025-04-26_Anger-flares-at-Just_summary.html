    <p>PRIMARY: Hundreds of Just Stop Oil protesters wearing orange vests marched through Westminster, London for their &quot;last day of action,&quot; blocking roads. During the march, a frustrated driver in a white minivan drove slowly into the protesters until the vehicle was pressed against them, with police intervening to move the crowd away. The group announced they are ending direct action, claiming victory as their demand to stop new oil and gas licenses has become government policy.<br><br>SECONDARY: The article references JSO&#x27;s previous disruptive actions including throwing soup on Van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers, spray-painting Charles Darwin&#x27;s grave, and climbing M25 gantries.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The Labour government has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration licenses, and recent court cases have halted various fossil fuel projects, though Prime Minister Starmer has criticized JSO&#x27;s methods.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral tone, reporting facts without editorial judgment on the protests.</p>
