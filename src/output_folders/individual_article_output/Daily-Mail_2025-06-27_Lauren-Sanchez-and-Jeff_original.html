    <p>&#x27;Despite them having booking, the police wouldn’t let them pass. It was party of five Americans, and they had booked an hour and a half for $100 each and so we had to cancel.<br><br>&#x27;The party involved was on a tight schedule and couldn’t rebook so we will have to refund them and so we have lost money.&#x27;<br><br>In addition to the bridges, the Venice local claimed that the canals were also shut gown and that police on jet skis turned them around when they tried to get through.<br><br>They added that there was &#x27;no real notification from the council that the canal would be closed.&#x27;<br><br>&#x27;I don&#x27;t begrudge [Jeff and Lauren] for getting married, but this has cost us money and of all the places in Venice they had to choose the one by us,&#x27; they added.<br><br>Photos also showed police presence all over the Italian city, including officers on jet skis in the canals, as water taxis went back and forth taking Lauren and Jeff&#x27;s guests from their hotels to the event.<br><br>Around 20 activists were seen protesting hours before the pre-wedding party in St Mark&#x27;s Square, the iconic heart of Venice.<br><br>Protesters held signs that read, &#x27;We are the 99 percent we have the power,&#x27; &#x27;the planet burns,&#x27; while someone even waved an extinction rebellion flag.<br><br>Sanchez and Bezos arrived in Venice for their wedding on Wednesday.<br><br>They were photographed outside the luxurious five-star Aman Hotel — where some suites cost nearly $14,000 a night — after being dropped off by a water taxi along with 50 of their 200-something guests.<br><br>They hosted a drinks reception with a playlist of romantic music, blasting More Than A Woman by the Bee Gees.

They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn&#x27;t stop our investigation.&#x27;<br><br>He shared alleged emails sent to him by Enquirer staffers, in which they described the racy images they had &#x27;obtained during their newsgathering&#x27; in detail.<br><br>&#x27;If in my position I can&#x27;t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?&#x27; Jeff continued.<br><br>&#x27;Of course I don&#x27;t want personal photos published, but I also won&#x27;t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.&#x27;<br><br>As for how Jeff and Lauren met, it was said that it was Lauren&#x27;s husband Patrick who was the first to introduce the two at an Amazon studios party for the movie Manchester By the Sea in 2016.<br><br>Her production team was then hired to film footage for Jeff&#x27;s rocket company, Blue Origin, in 2018.<br><br>&#x27;Patrick and Lauren have socialized with Jeff Bezos and his wife for a few years, because both [former] couples have houses in Seattle,&#x27; a source told Page Six after their affair was brought to light.<br><br>&#x27;Then Lauren was hired to work on one of Jeff&#x27;s projects, Blue Origin, a space-launch company. She has been shooting aerial shots for Jeff.&#x27;<br><br>Despite the start of their romance being shrouded in accusations of blackmail and extortion, cheating allegations, and an explosive affair, the couple did not let it defer them.<br><br>In fact, after splitting from their respective partners, Jeff and Lauren didn&#x27;t wait long to start flaunting their love all over the globe.<br><br>They were seen for the first time together publicly in May 2019, when photographers caught them enjoying a romantic date night in New York City, and they made their first official appearance as a couple at Wimbledon that July.<br><br>Since then, the couple has not tried to hide their romance, and for the last five years, they have continuously jetted off on a slew of lavish getaways together, shared tons of adorable, PDA-filled photos together on social media, gushed over one another nonstop in interviews, and attended a slew of star-studded events side by side.</p>
