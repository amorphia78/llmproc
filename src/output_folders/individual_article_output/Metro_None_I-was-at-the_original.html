    <p>Big Brother is back, baby (and thankfully with no wardrobe malfunctions this time, sorry Courtney Act!)<br><br>Five years since it was last on our screens, the hit-reality TV show – which began in 2000 and is now onto its 20th season – officially relaunched on Sunday night on ITV2.<br><br>In its glory days, Big Brother used to broadcast its first show live, but eagle-eyed viewers will have noticed that this latest season was actually pre-recorded the night before.<br><br>According to the producers, around 100,000 people applied for tickets to watch the housemates going into the iconic building at Garden Studios – and I was lucky enough to be one of the less than (what I’d estimate) 500 people there.<br><br>And it was chaos – in the most iconic way.<br><br>Up Next<br><br>I had an unfiltered view into the initial moments of the house – including more time watching the real-time video stream, so here’s what you didn’t see.<br><br>The audience didn’t get to see the VTs so we didn’t really have a clue who we were cheering for. If we did, I suspect there may have been some less enthusiastic hooting – or even boos.<br><br>In the TV edit, all of the interviews with the housemates were shortened for time, too.<br><br>One moment you didn’t see was Trish being asked what type of person she wouldn’t get along with in the house and without missing a beat, she replied: ‘Misogynists’. A huge roar or applause from the crowd echoed around the compound.<br><br>In a longer interview, Henry said he hoped there would be an ‘old lady’ in the house (to confusion from us) to which Will slightly corrected him by saying there might be ‘older’ women. Then he admitted he couldn’t cook, even though he’s a food writer.<br><br>Just before Kerry was announced, a huge portable ramp was wheeled out. When she emerged from the car, loud cheers filled the audience, and she later revealed that she’d taken six weeks off work for filming.<br><br>From the jump, AJ and Will were laughing, cracking jokes and not taking anything too seriously.<br><br>When the overhead portable camera with a teleprompter on top of it (called a jib, I learned!) started too far away for either of them to read while filming an introduction, they joked about it being impossible to see.<br><br>In between takes, AJ fixed a stray hair on her co-hosts head, made fun of her own accent and even sang the ‘more passion, more energy, more footwork’ meme when they were told to redo a particular take with more enthusiasm.<br><br>They had amazing chemistry together onscreen, but it felt real too when that red light stopped flashing.<br><br>As Farida got out of the car and made her way through the crowd-lined carpet to the stage, she started circling around the entire edge of the stage to high-five and scream along with audience members, who were loving her energy.<br><br>Will stepped in to lovingly escort the 50-year-old make-up artist from Wolverhampton up the stage, before she excitedly waved to her family and friends in the crowd.<br><br>She hilariously kept referring to the ‘creativity’ of everything  – from the colours of the interior to the very idea of Big Brother itself. An instant crowd favourite.<br><br>When Big Brother instructed the housemates to play a game of musical statues, it didn’t go as seamlessly as what we all saw on Sunday night.<br><br>Understandably, there was a lot of excitement and nerves among the housemates, so some of them kept talking over the instructions.<br><br>As a result, there were some awkward moments where Big Brother had to repeat himself. Amusingly, while playing the statues game, Hallie kept asking if she could go to the toilet.<br><br>Then, during the game of hide and seek, Big Brother had to keep encouraging the housemates to ‘come out, come out wherever you are’ from their hiding places – perhaps too scared of punishment!<br><br>I actually heard gasps from the crowd when AJ first came out in her blue latex catsuit and long flowing hair.</p>

    <p>In between takes, both her and Will got touch-ups on their hair and make-up, but at one stage, AJ walked up to the main entrance to the house and started doing an iconic photoshoot. Whipping her hair over her shoulder, she beamed as the crowd went wild and a photographer took some snaps.<br><br>And the second last picture in this Instagram reel was the result.<br><br>The aerial shots of the Big Brother compound – including the entrance and audience – from the drone looked incredible.<br><br>But for large parts of the filming process, it was quite hard to hear with the buzzing and whirring going on overhead.<br><br>Thankfully, they completely edited that out in the final cut on Sunday.<br><br>Sneak Peek ðï¸ It’s time for Big Brother: The Launch and the Housemates have arrived… #BBUK pic.twitter.com/1C501Wo8fI<br><br>Garden Studios is actually located along a canal, with one of the decorative eye entrances leading out to it (we actually initially thought the housemates would potentially arrive by boat!)<br><br>But during a break in the filming – where producers played music to keep the energy up among the crowd – a random boat came sailing down the canal. I saw people on top of it dancing and laughing, before whipping out their phones.<br><br>We actually all had to put our phones in locked pouches throughout the filming so we couldn’t take any photos or videos and spoil anything before the show went live the next day.<br><br>Sorry, this video isn&#x27;t available any more.<br><br>Including filming introductions, segues, and an extended look at the initial introductions of each housemate, it took about three hours to film it all.<br><br>After standing in line for a couple of hours and then standing the whole time during the filming – while constantly screaming and shouting – the energy certainly felt flatter the more time passed.
