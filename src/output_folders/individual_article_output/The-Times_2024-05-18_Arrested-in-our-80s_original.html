    <p>“Jesus was an activist, no doubt about it,” the Rev Dr Sue Parfitt says from a flowery armchair in her quaint cottage in Bristol. The octogenarian looks up to her mantelpiece at a wooden figure of Christ on the cross. “He broke the law continually and in the end was arrested and executed for it.” In the armchair opposite, Judy Bruce, 85, a retired biology teacher, smiles wryly.<br><br>A quiche may be warming in the oven, but Bruce and Parfitt aren’t here for a polite ladies’ lunch. A week ago they were arrested after the display case of Magna Carta at the British Library was chipped with a hammer and chisel. They held a banner that declared: “The government is breaking the law.” The act was carried out on behalf of Just Stop Oil (JSO). Bruce and Parfitt were both arrested and charged with £2,000 in criminal damage.<br><br>Since JSO was founded in 2022, its headline-grabbing stunts of civil disobedience — which it calls “actions” — have become a familiar sight. The climate group has managed to unite most of the country in irritation. Orange paint, soup and powder has been sprayed everywhere from snooker tournaments and art galleries to tennis matches and universities.<br><br>So why are two respectable elderly women, a reverend and a teacher, risking getting arrested in the name of the climate?<br><br>Over a cup of tea (with oat milk), and with Parfitt’s cats Holly and Mistletoe at their feet, the pair explain how they got into radical climate activism.<br><br>Parfitt, 82, was raised a Christian by conservative parents in south Wales. She read history at Bristol University and was briefly involved with the peace movement in the late 1960s but stopped because she feared being arrested at such a young age.<br><br>“It’s a different matter getting arrested in my eighties,” she says, matter-of-factly. “The point is to make the best use of your latter years. And what could be a better use than trying to save humanity from extinction?”<br><br>After stints as a nun and a family therapist, Parfitt married an Anglican priest and trained as one herself. When her husband died in 2013 she joined Christian Climate Action, which has since become the de facto Christian wing of Extinction Rebellion.<br><br>Bruce came to activism later in life, after retiring from teaching biology in a private school and moving to Swansea. She remembers always showing concern for things such as the ozone layer and GM crops, but became involved with Extinction Rebellion after her partner, who she says would have disapproved of her being arrested, died in 2020.<br><br>“When I first heard of doing actions that would end up with arrest, I thought, ‘Oh no. I don’t want to do that. Bad people do that!’ ” She was involved in a march during the G7 summit in Cornwall in 2021, but was motivated to break the law after “realising that non-arrestable ways of doing things are not making any impact at all”.</p>

    <p>They don’t exactly fit the classic profile of radical activists: Parfitt walks with a cane and Bruce is very slight, in a blue cardigan with pearl buttons. But both talk passionately about the climate crisis with a steely determination.<br><br>Bruce tells me she and Parfitt met “sitting in front of an oil tanker” in April 2022 and teamed up again at the suggestion of JSO when they unfurled a banner during a thanksgiving service at St Paul’s Cathedral that read: “Will our children thank us?”<br><br>“I think they had the idea that these two oldies might drum up some interest,” Parfitt says with a chuckle.<br><br>But they draw the line at some stunts. They turned down a suggestion to break the glass covering the Rokeby Venus painting in the National Gallery, chosen because it had been slashed by the suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914. (Two other JSO activists were arrested after it was vandalised in November and have pleaded not guilty to causing criminal damage.)<br><br>Parfitt’s background as a historian means she wants to ensure any painting or historical document will not be damaged. “There was no question there was any risk to Magna Carta, nor would we want there to be,” she says.<br><br>“We’re incredibly law-abiding citizens — believe it or not,” says Bruce.<br><br>Parfitt, still a practising Anglican priest, says the Church isn’t “terribly happy” about her involvement. “I have to report to my bishop every action I take,” she says.<br><br>Parfitt and Bruce know their actions rub people up the wrong way: they have lost friends and had fractious exchanges with family members. Bruce has been manhandled by a passerby. The two say they are vilified online and called “arthritic old codgers”, as Bruce puts it. “Well, I am arthritic,” Parfitt says with a laugh.<br><br>Both say the ageism they experience makes them feel sad rather than hurt. Parfitt says that as well as challenging perceptions of 80-year-olds, she wants to challenge their own age group too. “I often say to my friends, ‘Why don’t you come and do this, what have you got to lose?’. I don’t have grandchildren, but I say to people, ‘I’m doing this for your grandchildren’.”<br><br>But is it working? JSO floundered last year as its biggest donor, the green energy tycoon Dale Vince, announced he was cutting the cash supply, admitting that no amount of protesting would stop the government from North Sea drilling.<br><br>Are Bruce and Parfitt aware their actions may have alienated the public? They agree that climate activists can come across as preaching and self-righteous,“but in what other way is it possible to influence governmental action?” asks Bruce. “If we don’t do things that annoy people, it doesn’t get into the news.”</p>
