    <p>Two YouTube pranksters have taken on the spiralling cost-of-living crisis with a daring challenge that answered the age-old question: &#x27;Is it cheaper to fly to Poland to do your grocery shop?&#x27;<br><br>Josh &amp; Archie, an entertainment duo from London, published their video on Wednesday - the culmination of months of planning to fly to Poznan and buy a weeks&#x27; shopping for less than what they would have paid in a British supermarket.<br><br>The video, shared with their 1.47mn subscribers, saw the pair buy the shopping list of goods used by the government to measure inflation before taking a budget flight to central Europe and picking up the same items in a comparative store.<br><br>After spending the night in Poland and hauling their shop back across the continent, they totted up the difference and found the whole trip had cost them £11.14 less than the same shop at the Lidl in Clapham.<br><br>Speaking to MailOnline this evening, Josh Pieters said: &#x27;This is not a suggestion for how people can save money. It is more of a piece to highlight the ridiculous situation we seem to find ourselves in with the way inflation is going...<br><br>&#x27;Things are just so expensive now that it is literally cheaper to hop on an aeroplane and fly to another country and buy the same basket of goods - and still save money.&#x27;<br><br>In the video, Josh explains the consumer price inflation basket to be a governmental measure used to track the changing cost of regular goods and services.<br><br>The basket is made up of representative items such as bread, eggs and meats that consumers can be expected to buy in British stores.<br><br>The duo start their journey at Lidl in Clapham, London, buying the entire list for £164.47.<br><br>They then set about planning a cheap trip to Europe to find the same items for less, settling on Poznan in the west of Poland.<br><br>Budget airlines often run inexpensive flights to Poland from the UK and travellers can save large sums by booking in advance.<br><br>Hesitating to couch-surf, the pair spent about £56.68 on return overnight flights and a hostel, which cut largely into their budget.<br><br>But after spending only about £96.75 (converted from Zloty) on the equivalent shop in a Polish Lidl, they came out £11.14 richer for having left the country.<br><br>Speaking to MailOnline, Josh said the main concern was the extra cost of luggage on the flight if they went over their 20kg limit.<br><br>&#x27;Honestly, I thought we thought our plan might have been foiled by the charge of the the bag because the flight was obviously so cheap, but what we hadn&#x27;t thought about when we were planning the idea was that we&#x27;d obviously need a bag to come back because we needed to bring the groceries back to make the video work.</p>

    <p>&#x27;The fact that adding a bag is actually more expensive than the flight itself was a bit of a surprise. We were fine because we did make a profit, but only a small one.&#x27;<br><br>He said the process was quite tedious, finding all the items on the list and their equivalents in Poland.<br><br>&#x27;There was a lot of footage to cut down because that basket of goods is quite long and I saw the inside of a Lidl for many hours. We spared the viewers the boredom of having to watch us do two entire shops in Lidl. But it was a laborious process, making sure we picked out the exact same items and then also translating those items... because obviously they are in Polish in Poland.&#x27;<br><br>Earlier this year, the duo made headlines when they crashed Just Stop Oil&#x27;s &#x27;Beyond F***ed Banquet&#x27;.<br><br>The banquet was thrown off course when &#x27;Just Stop P***ing Everyone Off&#x27; protestors crashed the event with deafening &#x27;personal safety alarms&#x27;.<br><br>At the time, Archie told MailOnline: &#x27;Climate Change is the greatest crisis facing our generation - but if we&#x27;re going to solve it we need to work together.<br><br>&#x27;JSO&#x27;s tactics over the last 18 months haven&#x27;t worked; indeed people across the country are put off this vital cause as a result of their protesting.<br><br>&#x27;The people at JSO are well-intended; but they&#x27;re going about it the wrong way. Stopping mothers getting to hospital, or ruining people&#x27;s day out at the snooker isn&#x27;t doing anything to tackle climate change.&#x27;<br><br>Speaking this evening, Josh said the group would continue to find entertaining ways to &#x27;ask questions&#x27; about culturally interesting talking points.<br><br>On flying to Poland to save money on groceries, he said: &#x27;The main theme of our content would be finding silly loopholes and things which this video obviously does. You know, you can save money by doing your grocery shopping in Poland. It&#x27;s obviously ridiculous. No one has time to fly to Poland to do their grocery shop but it is a funny loophole.<br><br>&#x27;I would also say the secondary strand of what we like to try and do is to pose questions to people and to society. And I suppose that was the the point with the Just Stop Oil video, which was &quot;OK, these people are running ordinary people, ordinary people&#x27;s day, they&#x27;re blocking traffic... and basically disrupting people. How would they like it if we did the same thing to them?&quot;<br><br>&#x27;We try never to pick a side or get a political point across. We more look to pose a question and do it in an entertaining way. Above all else we want to entertain. That&#x27;s our main goal with all of these things. But if we can be slightly informative and make people think a little bit as well, then that&#x27;s great.&#x27;</p>
