    <p>PRIMARY: An environmental activist from Riposte Alimentaire stuck a poster on the glass case protecting Claude Monet&#x27;s Coquelicots at Paris&#x27;s Orsay Museum. The group campaigns for a &quot;social security system of sustainable food.&quot; The 1873 painting was undamaged and returned to display the same day.<br><br>SECONDARY: The same group previously threw soup on the Mona Lisa&#x27;s glass case at the Louvre in January. Just Stop Oil campaigners glued themselves to Vermeer&#x27;s Girl with the Pearl Earring in the Netherlands in 2022.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: French culture minister Rachida Dati demands legal reform to prosecute activists targeting glass-protected artworks, even without damage, calling for criminal policy against this &quot;new form of crime.&quot;<br><br>TONE: The article presents a negative tone toward the protests, using terms like &quot;iconoclasts&quot; and framing the actions as criminal attacks on culture.</p>
