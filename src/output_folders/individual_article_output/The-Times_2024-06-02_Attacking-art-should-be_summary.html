    <p>The French culture minister has demanded legal reform to ensure that activists who target artworks protected by glass are punished.<br><br>Rachida Dati spoke after an environmental activist stuck a poster on the glass case of Coquelicots (Poppy Field) by Claude Monet, the French impressionist, which hangs in Paris&#x27;s Orsay Museum.<br><br>The action by Riposte Alimentaire, a French group that campaigns for a &quot;social security system of sustainable food&quot;, was the latest in a string of attempts to use important artworks to gain publicity for its cause.<br><br>A source at Orsay Museum said the 1873 work by Monet, which it describes as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most famous paintings&quot;, was inspected, found to be undamaged and put back on display the same day.<br><br>Under French law, activists face up to seven years in prison and a fine of €100,000 for &quot;destroying, damaging or deteriorating&quot; a cultural item. But if there is no damage to the work, they often escape prosecution, according to lawyers.</p>

    <p><br><br>A member of the French branch of Extinction Rebellion told Le Figaro this year: &quot;The actions are not violent and they do not damage the artworks and so they are not criminally punishable.&quot;<br><br>Dati wants to change the law to ensure protesters no longer go unpunished in such cases.<br><br>&quot;Once again, a cultural institution and an artwork have been targeted by iconoclasts,&quot; she said.<br><br>She said she had asked the justice ministry to implement &quot;a criminal policy adapted to this new form of crime which attacks the most noble aspect of our cohesion — culture&quot;.<br><br>Officials in France and other European countries have struggled to deal with activists who attack the glass protecting major works without damaging the art itself.</p>
