    <p>Artificial rain has been used for the first time in Pakistan to battle hazardous levels of smog.<br><br>Planes equipped with cloud-seeding equipment - which helps clouds form and increases precipitation - flew over areas of Lahore on Saturday.<br><br>The megacity in Pakistan&#x27;s east is often ranked as one of the worst places in the world for air pollution.<br><br>&quot;It drizzled in at least 10 areas of Lahore,&quot; said the caretaker chief minister of Punjab, Mohsin Naqvi, according to Al Jazeera.<br><br>He said authorities were monitoring the impact of artificial rain in a 15km (nine mile) radius.<br><br>The &quot;gift&quot; of artificial rain was provided by the United Arab Emirates, Mr Naqvi said, adding: &quot;Teams from the UAE, along with two planes, arrived here about 10 to 12 days ago. They used 48 flares to create the rain.&quot;<br><br>The UAE has increasingly turned to cloud seeding to create rain in the country&#x27;s arid expanse.<br><br>The process, also known as artificial rain or blueskying, sees silver iodide, which has a similar structure to ice, sown into clouds to encourage condensation to form as rain.</p>
