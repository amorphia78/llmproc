    <p>By the summer of 2020, Huda Ammori, a young campaign officer for the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, had grown frustrated with the failure of mainstream protest movements to “destabilise the Zionist project”.<br><br>She was among a handful of more radical activists who had carried out one-off “blockades” against Israeli defence facilities in Britain, but believed these were far too infrequent to have an impact.<br><br>Disillusioned by the collapse of Corbynism, but inspired by the climate protests of Extinction Rebellion (XR), she quit her job and decided that “constant, sustained” militant action was needed.<br><br>Ammori allied with Richard Barnard, a like-minded veteran XR member, and together they founded Palestine Action (PA).<br><br>• Mass arrests at Palestine Action protest outside parliament<br><br>The fledgling group immediately set its sights on Elbit Systems, Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, which it claimed was directly profiting from the “apartheid regime over the Palestinian people”.<br><br>On a budget, with so few funds that they carried supplies to protests in plastic carrier bags, the activists began a co-ordinated campaign to wreak havoc on the company’s UK facilities and finances.<br><br>They scaled factory rooftops, smashed windows, doused buildings in red paint, chained themselves to machinery and destroyed any equipment they could access with sledgehammers and drills.<br><br>After the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas in 2023, PA grew in popularity, notoriety and numbers.<br><br>It had already expanded its target list to include other weapons firms linked to Israel, and began to take aim at banks, universities, insurance companies, government buildings and military installations.<br><br>Having claimed responsibility for more than 300 incidents across the country — sometimes resulting in violent clashes with police and the imprisonment of members — the group was already on a path to proscription when it carried out its most provocative action to date.<br><br>In June activists armed with crowbars and spray paint broke into RAF Brize Norton, the UK’s largest airbase, and rode electric scooters across the runway before damaging two refuelling jets.<br><br>It marked one of the most serious breaches of defence security for decades, causing an estimated £7 million of damage.<br><br>Within days the home secretary had moved to ban PA under anti-terrorism laws, proscribing it alongside the likes of Isis and National Action, the neo-Nazi terrorist group — the first time a direct action group would be classified in this way.<br><br>Membership or expressing support for the organisation is now a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in jail.<br><br>The move has prompted a High Court legal battle and there have already been protests resulting in several arrests. About 500 opponents of the ban are expected to put the proscription to the test on Saturday by gathering in Parliament Square outside the House of Commons.<br><br>Ammori, 31, was born in Bolton to a Palestinian father and an Iraqi mother. Her great-grandfather was involved in the 1936 uprising in Palestine against the British, she told Prospect magazine last year, and was killed by British soldiers, who also destroyed their ancestral home.<br><br>Her activism began while studying international business and finance at the University of Manchester between 2015 and 2018. It was during this time that Ammori became a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn and took part in her first direct action against Elbit.<br><br>In an article for The New Arab outlet in 2022, she recalled believing that Corbyn was her best hope of the establishment taking on Israel.<br><br>“The renewal of hope was alive, with Jeremy Corbyn, a committed anti-imperialist activist and politician, elected as leader of the Labour Party,” she wrote.<br><br>Immediately after graduating, Ammori started working for the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Britain’s largest group dedicated to the cause, on boycott and divestment campaigns and lobbying MPs.<br><br>Corbyn’s election defeat in 2019 shattered her belief that “implementing justice through the political system” was possible. She left her job a year later, feeling fed up that mainstream campaigns were of little consequence, and sought out more committed activists who had demonstrated against Elbit.<br><br>Palestine Action was founded on July 30 in 2020 after Ammori joined forces with Barnard, 52, an experienced XR activist, who was raised Catholic and once belonged to a Christian anarchist group called the Catholic Worker. Today he identifies as Muslim.<br><br>He picked up the idea of throwing red paint on buildings from his Christian activism, he revealed a year after PA was formed, describing it as a “Catholic Worker tradition”.<br><br>“It’s nothing new,” he said in an interview with Peace News magazine.<br><br>Barnard has broken into American air force bases in Germany nine times, according to Prospect. He has almost 30 tattoos, including of Benedictine mottos, Buddhist chants, an Irish Republican slogan, “freedom” in Arabic, 77 in Roman numerals and “all cops are bastards”.<br><br>In PA’s first demonstration in September 2020, activists occupied an Elbit factory in Shenstone, Staffordshire, smashing windows, drilling holes into ceilings, throwing air conditioning units to the ground and coating the building in red paint.<br><br>It then launched break-ins at the company’s Ferranti facility in Oldham, near Manchester, between 2020 and early 2022. The site was repeatedly occupied and vandalised, ultimately forcing Elbit to close the facility in an outcome the group declared as a major victory.<br><br>In 2021 PA began to widen its activities, occupying a drone factory in Leicester operated by UAV Tactical Systems, a subsidiary of Elbit. Activists chained themselves to the roof for nearly a week. Ten arrests were made for conspiracy to commit criminal damage and aggravated trespass, but defendants were cleared after the trial judge instructed the jury to consider the common law defence of necessity.<br><br>After launching its Scottish branch, PA targeted Thales, another defence firm. Its activists infiltrated the firm’s Glasgow facility in 2022, allegedly causing more than £1 million of damage. Five were jailed after members of the group threw a smoke bomb into an area where staff were being evacuated.</p>

    <p>In November 2022, less than a month after Just Stop Oil protesters threw tomato soup at one of Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers paintings, two PA members squirted tomato ketchup at a statue of the former prime minister the Earl of Balfour in the House of Commons.<br><br>The statesman has been a focus of activist anger as he was the signatory of the Balfour Declaration, a 1917 document that pledged support for the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine.<br><br>The group significantly ramped up its activities after Hamas massacred hundreds of Israelis on October 7, 2023, and Israeli forces announced a “full siege” on Gaza.<br><br>The day after the attack, Barnard said in a speech in Manchester: “When we hear the resistance, the al-Aqsa flood, we must turn that flood into a tsunami of the whole world.” The “al-Aqsa flood” is the Hamas name for its attack on Israel.<br><br>Analysis by The Sunday Times showed that the number of incidents for which PA was responsible had increased from 17 in 2020 to 170 in 2024.<br><br>In the wake of October 7, the group published a list of more than 50 targets “complicit in Elbit’s murderous arms trade”, with its rhetoric shifting from ending “Israeli apartheid” towards dismantling “Israel’s war machine”.<br><br>• Revealed: Palestine Action’s map of UK targets<br><br>A few days later they sprayed the headquarters of the BBC — which wasn’t on the list — with red paint to “symbolise complicity in genocide”. Protesters also blockaded Lockheed Martin, a global security firm, in Bedford, smeared red paint over the Foreign Office and targeted the headquarters of the aerospace firm Leonardo, at which two men were arrested for what the Metropolitan Police called racially aggravated criminal damage.<br><br>The group again took aim at Balfour in March 2024 — this time using blades to slash a painting of him hanging at the University of Cambridge.<br><br>Seven months later — to mark the declaration’s anniversary — they reportedly stole two busts of Israel’s first president from the University of Manchester’s chemistry building.<br><br>In August 2024 activists allegedly drove a modified van into Elbit’s headquarters in Bristol, ramming the entrance on Bolingbroke Way in Patchway, a town on the outskirts of the city, shortly before 4am.<br><br>Once inside they dismantled defence equipment, reportedly caused £1 million in damage and assaulted employees and officers who intervened, Avon and Somerset constabulary said. Two police officers were attacked with a sledgehammer, according to police, with axes, whips and other homemade weapons also seized from the scene.<br><br>One officer was taken to hospital with injuries to her back, while the other received medical treatment at the scene after being struck on the back of his legs. An employee of the business was treated by paramedics for an injury to their head. Eighteen people were charged and held on remand over the break-in.<br><br>• Undercover with Palestine Action: ‘Damage as much as possible’<br><br>In an article written in April this year, Ammori described staff who worked at Elbit factories as being “embedded in the military apparatus” who would not be sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.<br><br>“Most of the senior managers are sent over from Israel. As for those on the shop floor, if they haven’t left their jobs this long into the genocide then frankly there isn’t much hope of winning them over,” the article for the New Left Review journal said.<br><br>“Elbit has released videos which show its workers describing themselves as ‘civil soldiers’ who are proud to be arming the regime. So the question is, if they consider themselves soldiers, can we consider them potential comrades?”<br><br>In June the group carried out its most controversial action yet: infiltrating RAF Brize Norton using electric scooters to bypass security before vandalising military aircraft. They sprayed red paint into the engines of two Airbus Voyager tankers, used for air-to-air refuelling, and caused further damage to the aircraft using crowbars. The activists also covered the runway of the Oxfordshire base in paint before escaping undetected.<br><br>Video of the break-in provoked a national outcry and a security review of Britain’s military facilities.<br><br>Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, proposed to ban PA under the Terrorism Act on June 23, three days after the Brize Norton incident.<br><br>She described the breach as the “latest in a long history of unacceptable criminal damage” committed by the group.<br><br>“Since its inception in 2020, Palestine Action has orchestrated a nationwide campaign of direct criminal action against businesses and institutions, including key national infrastructure and defence firms that provide services and supplies to support Ukraine, Nato, Five Eyes allies and the UK defence enterprise,” she told the Commons.<br><br>Justifying the move, she added: “Its activity has increased in frequency and severity since the start of 2024 and its methods have become more aggressive, with its members demonstrating a willingness to use violence.”<br><br>However, last week, the High Court ruled that Ammori had an arguable case against proscription, with a hearing set for the autumn. So far there have been 200 arrests at protests in support of the group, with hundreds more expected on Saturday.<br><br>“Obviously people in Palestine Action understand the severity of what’s happening and there’s a sense of frustration, but there’s also a lot of unity in terms of wanting to fight this and not crumble to pressure,” Ammori told the Guardian days before PA was proscribed.<br><br>“I think they’re completely shooting themselves in the foot if they do this, they are completely delegitimising their own laws,” she added.<br><br>Previously responding to their impending proscription, PA said: “Under Section 1 of the Genocide Convention, Britain is obliged to prevent and punish the crime of genocide … When our government fails to uphold their moral and legal obligations, it is the responsibility of ordinary citizens to take direct action. The terrorists are the ones committing a genocide, not those who break the tools used to commit it.”</p>
