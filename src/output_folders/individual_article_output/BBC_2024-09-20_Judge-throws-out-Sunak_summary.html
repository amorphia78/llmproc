    <p>PRIMARY: Four Greenpeace activists (Michael Grant, 64, Mathieu Soete, 38, Amy Rugg-Easey, 33, and Alexandra Wilson, 32) climbed on the roof of former PM Rishi Sunak&#x27;s constituency home in North Yorkshire, draping it in black fabric with a &quot;No New Oil&quot; sign. They were charged with criminal damage but had their case dismissed due to insufficient evidence proving they caused the roof damage.</p>
