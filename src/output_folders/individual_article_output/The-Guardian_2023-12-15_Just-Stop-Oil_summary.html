        <h1>Just Stop Oil activist jailed for six months for taking part in slow march</h1><p>PRIMARY: Stephen Gingell, 57, a father of three from Manchester, was sentenced to six months in jail for participating in a peaceful slow march protest. He was one of about 40 Just Stop Oil supporters who marched on Holloway Road in north London for 30 minutes. This is believed to be the first imprisonment under the new Public Order Act 2023, which criminalizes interference with key national infrastructure including roads.<br><br>SECONDARY: Just Stop Oil conducted a broader campaign of slow march protests between late October and December 4, resulting in 470 supporters being arrested 630 times, with about half under the new law.</p>
