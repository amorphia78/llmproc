        <h1>First trial of Just Stop Oil activists under new anti-protest laws begins</h1><p>PRIMARY: Three Just Stop Oil supporters - Phoebe Plummer, Chiara Sarti and Daniel Hall - are on trial for conducting a slow march that blocked traffic on Cromwell Road in west London for less than 20 minutes in November. They are charged under the new Public Order Act 2023 for &quot;interference with key national infrastructure&quot; and demand the government halt all new oil, gas and coal licences. Two protesters were held on remand for over two weeks.</p>
