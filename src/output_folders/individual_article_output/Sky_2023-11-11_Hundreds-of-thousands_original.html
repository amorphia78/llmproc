    <p>The Met can impose conditions relating to the duration and route of a march, as placing a number restriction is totally unworkable. That is what they will be doing with the organisers this Saturday, as the organising groups have refused to cancel the protest.<br><br>Section 13 of the Public Order Act relates to banning a march. This is only applicable if the commissioner reasonably believes that the powers under Section 12 - any conditions he imposes on the procession - will not be sufficient to prevent serious disorder.<br><br>Sir Mark clearly stated that, at the moment, the intelligence does not support the &quot;reasonable belief&quot; that serious disorder is likely, hence he cannot legally apply for a ban under Section 13. I would agree that is probably the case.<br><br>Sir Mark then explained the law around gatherings or assemblies. Police can impose conditions on these under Section 14 of Public Order Act, which is similar to Section 12 in that there needs to be a &quot;reasonable belief&quot; of &quot;serious disorder&quot;.<br><br>However a key difference is that Section 13 only applies to processions or marches under Section 12 - and not gatherings under Section 14.  There are no legal powers to ban people gathering.<br><br>The Met tried to prevent unlawful assemblies using Section 14 across London a few years ago with Just Stop Oil, but the High Court ruled it was unlawful and that gatherings cannot be legally banned.<br><br>Nearly 2,000 officers on duty<br><br>More than 1,000 police officers have been drafted in from outside forces to monitor the march, with the Met saying 1,850 officers will be on duty on Saturday and 1,375 on Sunday.<br><br>Click to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts<br><br>Officers have set up exclusion zones covering the Cenotaph, Whitehall, Horse Guards Parade, the Westminster Abbey Field of Remembrance and other relevant areas.<br><br>Crime correspondent<br><br>The police measures come as no surprise - lots of cops, exclusion zones and a strict time limit.<br><br>It&#x27;s all aimed at preventing breakaway groups from moving off and causing trouble away from the main protest.<br><br>The march organisers have already agreed not to clash with Armistice Day ceremonies around iconic sites such as the Cenotaph and other war memorials.<br><br>But police believe the biggest threat of disorder comes from those planning counter demonstrations, especially far-right groups who have issued rallying calls for their supporters to meet in central London.<br><br>Over the past four weeks of protests the Met, under early widespread criticism, increased its arrest rate and says the new restrictions will enable officers to move faster and more robustly against troublemakers.<br><br>The commissioner Sir Mark Rowley believes he can cope and, anyway, does not have intelligence of a threat of serious public disorder that would enable him to ask for a complete ban on the march.<br><br>His job may not be on the line, but the reputation of him and his force, after a troubled two years, certainly is.<br><br>The Met says &quot;anyone believed to be part of, or associated with, the pro-Palestinian demonstration trying to assemble in this area can be arrested&quot;.<br><br>Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor, who is in charge of policing the protest, said: &quot;Our job is to ensure that we police without fear or favour, that we balance the rights of everybody, be that protesters, counter-protesters, or people living or coming into London.<br><br>&quot;And our job this weekend is to ensure that people are kept safe, and that is what my focus is on.&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, protests at a number of London train stations have been banned, with prohibition orders in place at Waterloo, Victoria and Charing Cross between 10am and 11pm on Saturday.<br><br>Transport Secretary Mark Harper, who approved the move, said: &quot;Armistice Day is a moment of solemn national reflection in remembrance of those who have given their lives in service of our country. It&#x27;s important that people can use our rail network to safely travel, free from intimidation.&quot;</p>
