    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article focuses significantly on Scheffler&#x27;s tournament victory and his achievement of winning six times before July, matching Arnold Palmer&#x27;s 1962 record.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral to slightly dismissive tone toward the protest, treating it more as a minor disruption than a serious environmental action.</p></body></html>
