        <h1>Activists throw soup on Van Gogh painting again</h1><p>PRIMARY: Three Just Stop Oil protesters (two women and one man) threw orange soup at two Van Gogh Sunflowers paintings at London&#x27;s National Gallery, hours after two other activists received jail sentences for a similar 2022 attack. The protesters demanded an end to new oil and gas projects, calling imprisoned activists &quot;prisoners of conscience.&quot; All three were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, though the paintings were undamaged.</p>
