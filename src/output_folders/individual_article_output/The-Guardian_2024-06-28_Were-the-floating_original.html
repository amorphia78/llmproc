        <h1>We’re the floating voters who will decide this election. With a week to go, this is what we think</h1><p>Our panel of undecided voters on whether their views have changed in recent weeks – and who will get their support<br><br>As many as 15% of British voters are still undecided about who to vote for. How they make up their minds will have seismic consequences for the UK’s political future – so the Guardian has spoken to a range of undecided voters from across the country. In the second part of this series, we hear how their opinions have changed in recent weeks, and whether they have come to a decision on who to vote for ahead of next week’s ballot.<br><br>I’m not a political person, so I haven’t been following the campaigns. I have had some leaflets through the post, which I tried to read – but nothing really jumped out at me. My friends and family now all seem to be supporting Labour, and I think I’m coming round to voting the same way. In 2019, I voted SNP, but in my part of Scotland they have lost support and I am convinced that we need a change from the Conservatives.<br><br>I like some of Labour’s policies. What they are saying about bringing down NHS waiting lists and adding evening and weekend appointments is important to me. There are so many people waiting – you hear about it all the time on the news. My husband had to go private for an operation after being on an NHS waiting list for 18 months.<br><br>My daughter doesn’t feel anyone will change things for her, so she isn’t planning on voting. But I do think it’s important to use your voice. Everyone’s voice matters. The economy is terrible for the younger generation but it’s not getting better under the Conservatives. It’s not easy to get on the housing ladder like it was back in the day. Rent is hugely expensive, even more than a mortgage.<br><br>We’ll have to see what happens under Labour. I don’t know if they will be able to make the change they say they will, but let’s give them a chance. Let’s see if they can get the economy going and the cost of living down. I just hope they reduce tax as well. Tax is very high at the moment, especially for working people in good jobs. I want to see Labour make it a bit easier for them to move up in the world.<br><br>As told to Lucy Pasha-Robinson<br><br>I’ve been a Conservative voter for most of my life and I’m appalled by Betgate – you really couldn’t make it up, could you? It really just confirmed my view that the Conservatives have absolutely lost their moral compass. They continue to prove they are unfit to govern, and I really do not see a world where I would vote for them again.<br><br>I’m not a fan of Keir Starmer. It seems as if he will say anything to get into power. I’m really concerned about the environment and I’m disappointed in Labour’s stance – the climate crisis just doesn’t seem to be on their list of priorities. Still, I know the race is really between Labour and the Tories at this point, and I’d much rather have Labour, even if I’m not planning on voting for them.<br><br>I think it’s important to contribute to the Green vote across the country. That’s not to say I want the Greens in power; that would be somewhat disastrous. They’ve got some rubbish policies – their plan for the transition to electric cars is too hasty. We do ultimately need the transition from petrol-driven cars but it can’t happen overnight. Still, the country needs to adopt many of their other policies on climate. We need to reduce our carbon emissions and we need to protect our wild spaces and oceans; the Greens are the only party that have this as a central goal.<br><br>I still don’t know anything about Ed Davey or what the Lib Dems’ policies are. Ultimately, I’ll be voting Green. If Labour were to put some greener policies on the table then I’d be happy, but I would still vote Green because Labour is a done deal in my constituency anyway. My vote won’t change this, so I’d rather vote with my conscience.<br><br>As told to Sophia Brousset<br><br>I’ve decided to base my vote on policies, and not politicians or the previous performance of parties in my constituency. To that end, Reform is a no. Nigel Farage has charisma in a bad grandad sort of way, but the UK needs immigration and it’s disingenuous to blame all the country’s problems on one issue.<br><br>The Conservative party death spiral continues downwards, and I have no desire to help them out with my vote. The election betting scandal is another example of the lack of integrity that appears to be endemic within the party. National service is a bizarre and desperate last straw for it to cling on to. For me, this shows how important it is to give the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds – one of Labour’s policies. Imagine not being able to have a say despite one of the major parties pushing you into military service or enforced “volunteering”.<br><br>However, I can’t bring myself to vote for Labour. Their biggest selling point is that they’re not the Tories. I find it frustrating that Labour isn’t being more ambitious. I understand that to make changes you must be in power and thus appeal to the centre vote, but there’s a difference between safe and boring.<br><br>So that leaves me once again with a choice between the Greens or the Lib Dems. I agree with Green policies in principle, such as taxing assets over £10m, greater investment in the NHS, carbon taxes, short-haul flight bans and renewable energy. The Greens also perform better in my local area than the Lib Dems, so it would be less of a wasted vote.<br><br>But then I read the Lib Dem manifesto. Based on policies alone, they are my current frontrunner. Their manifesto supports strong climate policies, proportional representation, rejoining the single market and more doctors – all of which is music to my ears. However, because the Lib Dems historically don’t do well in my constituency, I’ve seen neither hide nor hair of them.<br><br>Looking ahead to next week, I’m cautiously optimistic. It seems the end is nigh for the Conservative government, and I am glad to see the back of them. But I do hope that once in government, the Labour party finds the courage to be bold.<br><br>I volunteer in a food bank, and see hundreds of people who cannot keep up with the cost of food, let alone the cost of energy and housing. We’re a rich country, and it is criminal that people have to rely on food banks. I’ve read all the manifestos and Labour has gone up in my estimation, but I don’t think they go far enough on social issues and the climate.<br><br>Realistically, I think there are only two parties that could run the country, and that’s Labour and the Lib Dems. The Greens have fantastic ideas, but I’m not sure they have the experience. The first-past-the-post system is not doing us any favours – the Green party would make a fantastic coalition partner, pushing Labour beyond its current aims, but that won’t be possible under the current system.<br><br>I really don’t think Keir Starmer has his finger on the pulse with regard to climate. There were thousands and thousands of people at the Restore Nature Now march in London last Saturday, and he didn’t even mention it – but some orange powder paint is thrown on Stonehenge and everybody knows about it. He calls the Just Stop Oil protesters “pathetic”, but on the climate crisis, it’s him that’s pathetic.</p>

    <p>I know we need to be sensible about spending, but we have more scope to address the climate than Labour claims. The Lib Dems are prepared to talk about raising more money, whether through borrowing or taxation on wealthier people, myself included. They get a lot of flak for their role in the 2010 coalition, but they also started this country’s wind revolution. Despite the Conservative’s recent mismanagement, we are still reaping the benefits of British wind power, and that’s thanks to the Lib Dems.<br><br>Still, waking up 5 July to a Conservative MP would be terrible. That is what’s weighing on me. The Lib Dems are where my heart is, but with Labour polling better in my constituency, I’m not sure it’s a safe use of my vote. I’m still making up my mind. I would not be prepared to vote today. Even next week, I suspect I’ll be deciding on the way to the polling station.<br><br>As told to Sophia Brousset<br><br>After listening to candidates in my local area, I have finally reached a decision about who to vote for. I tried watching the televised debates but they were dire on all sides. There is a distinct lack of spontaneity, empathy and listening skills.<br><br>Like a lot of people, I just don’t believe what I’m being told by any of the major parties. So I decided that my vote could only be determined by the candidate whooffers the most to my local area. Not someone who parrots the party line regardless of the actual question.<br><br>I attended my local hustings for the North East Fife constituency and liked three of the candidates there. But in the end, I decided to vote for the incumbent, who is Lib Dem. She has demonstrated an active interest in the local community and has also participated at Westminster in various debates, especially around health and social care, so she seems like a safe choice.<br><br>I have only received two party leaflets through the post – even though we are supposed to be the most marginal seat in Scotland – and I have seen no on-street canvassing. It doesn’t seem like the parties are working particularly hard to win my vote. Looking at the national picture, it is clear that the Tory party is imploding from within, the Labour party looks set for victory, despite the broken promises and Scottish independence looks as far away as ever.<br><br>My hope for the future (perhaps a futile one) is that more young people become engaged in politics and take the current system down. However, that would require an investment in young people and engagement with them to promote a critical awareness of the importance of politics. From what I have seen in this campaign, very few mainstream politicians would want the electorate to be so thoughtfully engaged.<br><br>The local campaigning in my area has definitely stepped up a gear, with party leaflets arriving through the postbox. In my area, it’s the Lib Dems, not Labour, who are the main challengers to the Tories. I received a letter from a former Labour member stating that since Labour is third in many parts of the country, voting Labour in these areas will help the Conservatives win. I don’t want to believe that, but since my area is Lib Dem, I might vote tactically again.<br><br>I do want change, but I just don’t think it is going to happen. While energy bills have gone down, they are still nearly double what I was paying before former prime minister, Liz Truss, bombed the economy. People are worried about their monthly bills increasing. The cost of living has soared and yet salaries remain the same. The political parties still haven’t addressed what they are going to do about it.<br><br>It’s shocking that the building safety crisis still hasn’t been mentioned in the debates and manifestos, especially considering this affects millions of leaseholders who don’t feel safe in their own homes.<br><br>I’m disappointed by the major parties not prioritising importance issues like knife crime. While Keir Starmer has vowed to make tackling knife crime a “moral mission”, I don’t believe he will keep to his word.<br><br>I’ve been watching some of the live debates. I think Nigel Farage will persuade a lot of people to vote for his party. I think he will appeal to disillusioned voters who have lost faith in the major parties. He seems to be going after a younger audience on social media (his TikTok videos have garnered more engagement and views than any other candidate). Some may be first-time voters, so it will be interesting to see how this all plays out on the 4 July. A lot of my friends are confused, and don’t know who to vote for. I worry that the younger generation may not vote at all, which will affect the outcome of the general election. Regardless of how I’m feeling, I will always vote – the suffragettes died so women could have the vote.<br><br>Locally, this election doesn’t really feel like a contest. There hasn’t been much in the way of canvassing that I have seen. The placards are up, and all seem to be for Labour. I’ve not seen any others in this seat. Nationally, the leadership debates, as usual, have been better for the smaller parties, but they haven’t really swayed me.<br><br>For me, the biggest change in recent weeks has come from quite an unexpected source. The EU election results and the success of the populist right was really worrying, particularly the number of young voters who supported it. I read that the reason they voted that way was out of fear for their lack of future. Somehow the populist right had tapped into this and offered hope. This has made me think that perhaps Labour have pitched their campaign correctly. The promise of wealth generation and new job opportunities might be more palatable for the young than a wealth tax.<br><br>However, for me the Green message holds two strengths. Firstly, I strongly feel that we need a fairer tax system that goes beyond income. I’ve never believed Conservative “trickle-down” economics would benefit anyone outside the top earners. For me, those who can contribute most should contribute most, and companies operating in a country should pay tax there. Secondly, first past the post is an outdated electoral system and disfranchises too many. If young people want to vote for the populists they should be represented. “Broad church” politics denies choice and a voice to so many. For those reasons, I have decided I will vote Green this time.<br><br>This article was amended on 28 June 2024 to make it clear that Jennie Brown will be voting in the North East Fife constituency.</p></body></html>
