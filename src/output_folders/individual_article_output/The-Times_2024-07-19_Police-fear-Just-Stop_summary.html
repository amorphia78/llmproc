        <h1>Police fear Just Stop Oil jail sentences will spark more protests</h1><h2>The record term for Roger Hallam could serve as a ‘rallying call’, says the detective who led the investigation into his plot to bring the M25 to a standstill</h2><p>PRIMARY: Roger Hallam, 58-year-old co-founder of Just Stop Oil, was sentenced to five years in prison for orchestrating M25 protests in November 2022, where 45 protesters climbed motorway gantries over four days. Four other activists received four-year sentences. The protests delayed over 700,000 vehicles and caused £765,000 in economic damage.<br><br>SECONDARY: The activists were caught planning the protests during a Zoom call recorded by an undercover reporter, with police noting they aimed to cause &quot;absolute gridlock and chaos.&quot;</p><p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: Police fear the record sentences for peaceful protest could serve as a &quot;rallying call&quot; for more climate activism, with calls for the government to repeal Conservative anti-protest laws.<br><br>TONE: The article presents a neutral tone, balancing criticism of the sentences from politicians and UN commissioners with support from former Conservative ministers.</p></body></html>
