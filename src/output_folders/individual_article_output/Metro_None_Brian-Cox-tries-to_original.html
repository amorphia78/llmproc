        <h1>Brian Cox tries to make sense of Tekken’s story so far in dramatic recap video</h1><p>Succession actor Brian Cox has made an unexpected appearance in the marketing for Tekken 8, as he recaps the entire history of the lead characters.<br><br>Before the new year, the idea of a crossover between the worlds of Succession and Tekken 8 would have been laughed off as an obvious impossibility.<br><br>It turns out 2024 is determined to make anything possible, within its first few weeks, as Brian Cox, best known for playing Logan Roy in the HBO series, has recapped the history between Jin Kazama and his father Kazuya Mishima, in a dramatic retelling of the story so far.<br><br>Tekken might hold the Guinness World Record for the longest-running video game storyline, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t nonsensical – with only the most dedicated fan, and Brian Cox, likely to known what’s going on.<br><br>The silliness of it all is acknowledged in the clip by Cox, who is very dedicated to the bit. In the clip, the actor asks: ‘How did we even get to this point? What is a Devil Jin? And why do these fathers and sons keep throwing each other off cliffs?’<br><br>The five-minute video gives an overview of the dynamic between Tekken’s main characters, Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima and his father Heihachi Mishima, over the past nine entries in the series (including the two Tag Tournaments). The next instalment, Tekken 8, is pitched as the final fight between Kazuya and his son Jin.</p>

    <p>Tekken producer Michael Murray even acknowledged the difficulty in ‘trying to make sense of the overarching story’ in a post about the video on Twitter.<br><br>While the crossover in itself is unexpected, Cox has contributed to various games in the past. He previously voiced emperor Scolar Visari in the Killzone series and was the main antagonist in Rockstar’s controversial 2003 title Manhunt and EA’s Syndicate reboot.<br><br>Tekken 8 is set to be released on Xbox Series S/X, PlayStation 5 and PC on January 26.
