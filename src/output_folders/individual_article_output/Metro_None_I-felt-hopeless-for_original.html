    <p>When I first met my boyfriend just over two years ago, we always felt safe.<br><br>As members of the LGBTQ+ community, I felt safe if we kissed in public, I felt safe when we held hands. If anything, I felt safer because I had him with me.<br><br>I don’t anymore.<br><br>With hostility towards feeling as though it’s increasing daily and more attacks on LGBTQ+ people – particularly trans – by our own government, safety feels like a long-gone memory.<br><br>I no longer feel safe walking down the street while holding hands with my partner, without fear of ridicule at best; an attack at worst.<br><br>I’ve felt completely hopeless about our future as LGBTQ+ people when it feels like most of the world is against us. Of course they’re not, but our biggest enemies are always the loudest people in the room – at least on social media.<br><br>And then came Big Brother.<br><br>Sorry, this video isn&#x27;t available any more.<br><br>Just two days into the long-awaited reboot, housemate Hallie has come out as trans – on her own terms and not at the demand of ITV – and Jordan came out as bisexual without absolutely no fuss on fanfare from the other contestants or even the public.<br><br>Out of respect, the entire group collectively shared their pronouns.<br><br>It only took a matter of seconds, no one got angry, the world kept turning.<br><br>Part of the appeal of Big Brother has always been watching strangers who very quickly don’t feel like strangers at all.<br><br>When Brian Dowling won Big Brother in 2001, I felt like I’d met a gay man for the very first time. When Nadia Almada won just three years later, the nation fell in love with a trans woman who was petrified to tell her housemates about her authentic self, unaware she was adored by the public.<br><br>And not just adored, we genuinely would have taken Nadia into our homes, let her chain-smoke in the garden and welcomed her like she was part of the family.<br><br>Big Brother without a doubt played an instrumental part in the progression for LGBTQ+ people throughout the noughties, at least in the UK.<br><br>Brian became the first openly gay children’s TV presenter which genuinely would have been unthinkable before Big Brother. Turns out we weren’t ‘creepy’ or that different to everyone else after all.<br><br>Big Brother has always had the power to change the narrative, quash misconceptions about race, gender, sexuality, age, disability and religion. It has always been vitally ‘woke’ and thankfully it continues to be so.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times. Then, one day, he opened his front door and started walking. He didn&#x27;t stop for three years, by which time he&#x27;d walked the coast of the UK and improved his mental health.<br><br>Writer Azania Patel shares her worst date series for our So, How Did it Go? series. She fancied her date - until he admitted to being a Just Stop Oil protester.<br><br>Labour MP Dawn Butler shines a light on the small change the Conservatives have made recently that could help them steal the election. She reckons you didn&#x27;t even notice.</p>

    <p>And finally, mum-of-two Kellie Whitehead recalls the time she took &#x27;snus&#x27; with her 17-year-old son. She says she was overwhelmed by the strength of the nicotine pouch and now has a warning for parents.<br><br>But it’s also always made a lot of us feel safer.<br><br>After watching LGBTQ+ people being treated with respect inside the Big Brother house, I felt hopeful for the first time in a very long time. Hopeful that not every stranger is a hateful bigot, warped by miseducation about our community.<br><br>Far from it. People can be amazing – they can be kind and compassionate to LGBTQ+ people far beyond anything we’ve seen on television outside of Drag Race.<br><br>Even better, they can be completely unfazed by the prospect of living with a trans woman when outside the house the overriding noise is telling people they’re not safe to even share a bathroom with them.<br><br>When Hallie laid out the reality of being trans, explaining both the emotional and financial strain to housemates Kerry, Olivia and Jenkin, their only response was protection.<br><br>Kerry later told Big Brother in the Diary Room she actually felt ‘privileged’ to be a part of that conversation.<br><br>In countless ways it’s felt as though progression for LGBTQ+ people has gone backwards since Brian and Nadia won their respective Big Brothers when our rights and safe spaces are literally being torn away.<br><br>But Big Brother has already proved just a couple of days into its new series why it was needed more than ever in 2023. It has always been the only television show to bring complicated conversations to mainstream audiences and make them so simple and so human.<br><br>There is nothing quite like Big Brother educating viewers about people they may otherwise never meet and thankfully it appears that is the priority of this series so far – to challenge, enlighten and educate. Luckily when combined, it happens to also be entertaining.<br><br>While I would love nothing more than another David’s Dead moment, I’m even more excited at the prospect of another Brian or Nadia to burst out of the Big Brother house and bring with them the hope for a better understanding and future for the LGBTQ+ community.<br><br>Of course, Big Brother alone isn’t going to suddenly flip the toxic discourse around the LGBTQ+ community but as we’ve seen before it can do an awful lot to help.<br><br>Inside the £6,500,000 stately townhouse where Britain&#x27;s most powerful man grew up<br><br>Our dream doer-upper turned into a £200,000 nightmare<br><br>What I Own: We bought a two-bedroom ex-council property in Hackney for £400,000<br><br>I was duped into buying a rat-infested house — it cost us £6,450<br><br>The tiny UK city where almost 50% of people have no mortgage<br><br>Big Brother airs nightly at 9pm on ITV2.<br><br>Do you have a story you’d like to share?
