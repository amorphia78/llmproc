    <p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil activists, Jennifer Kowalski (28) and Cole Macdonald (22), pleaded not guilty to criminal damage and interfering with national infrastructure after spray painting two private jets at Stansted Airport on June 20. The activists entered the airfield and used fire extinguishers filled with orange paint to target aircraft owned by Prudential Insurance and an investment group, causing Â£52,000 in cleanup costs.<br><br>SECONDARY: No secondary protest actions mentioned.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article notes that Taylor Swift&#x27;s private jet was not at the airport during the incident, despite Just Stop Oil claiming it had landed &quot;mere hours before.&quot; Both defendants were granted bail with conditions preventing them from going within a mile of airports.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral, factual tone focused on legal proceedings rather than editorial commentary about the protest.</p></body></html>
