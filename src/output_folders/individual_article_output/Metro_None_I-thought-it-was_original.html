    <p>What’s the worst thing that has happened to you in a job interview?<br><br>Fluffed your lines? Asked the wrong question? Well, I bet I can top it.<br><br>It was 2016, and I was being interviewed for a factory job. Everything seemed to be going well, and I thought I was going to get it.<br><br>But then, the interviewer produced an image of my prison mugshot, and a news story about my recent conviction for wasting police time.<br><br>At that moment, I felt awful – I just wanted the ground to swallow me up. I even began to deny it was me in the article, but the interviewer knew.<br><br>Surprisingly, I actually managed to get the role; the interviewer loved my attitude and my perseverance because I had kept showing up and asking for a job.<br><br>I was thrilled to have passed this hurdle, but I was still struck by the overwhelming sense of shame that had come over me when my past was brought up.<br><br>It wasn’t the first time this has happened, and it’s degrading. I do not want to be defined by crimes I’ve committed.<br><br>I’m not ashamed to talk about my convictions, but during the nearly two decades I spent in and out of prison, I know it’s hard to feel accepted in a new environment.<br><br>When you’ve left prison and find yourself in work, you never shake the feeling that everyone is talking about you behind your back.<br><br>When that happens, it can be easy to slip back into a life of crime, to become that worst version of yourself that everyone seems to assume you are.<br><br>My criminal history began in 2004 when I was 14, obsessed with cars, and growing up on an estate.<br><br>Falling in with the wrong crowd and misbehaving in school, it didn’t take long for me to decide to break into a neighbour’s car and take it for a spin with a couple of friends. When the owner found us, chaos broke out.<br><br>The owner put my mate in a headlock, a fight between the three of us started and the man was injured. The judge said we were one kick away from manslaughter.<br><br>That was my first 16 months behind bars. Aged 15, I left a Children’s Secure Unit and was soon faced with how hard it is to go back to your old life.<br><br>I was scared, and knew I would struggle without the routine of the unit.<br><br>Initially, I had planned to go back to my studies but due to my record no schools accepted me. I attended one institute for an hour a week but that was it.<br><br>My support worker discussed getting into employment, but in my mind, I already had a way to earn money without anyone’s help: stealing cars.<br><br>It felt like the only choice I could make, but it also meant I was in and out of prison for 18 years.<br><br>I committed a range of crimes: burglary, assault, driving under the influence, and I abused drugs and alcohol.<br><br>During this period, I also had different factory roles, tried out college, had a child with my ex-partner and came out as gay in 2011. After three years without arrest, in 2015, I was in a dark place having issues with my son, and that set me back on the criminal path.<br><br>My relationship with my last partner was also a factor. The relationship was fraught with arguments and when it finally broke down in 2018, so did I.<br><br>That all led me to my last conviction in 2019.<br><br>I was convicted for dangerous driving, street robbery and possession of cannabis. I lost everything, including the friends who committed these crimes with me.<br><br>I spent four-and-a-half years in prison.<br><br>My head was a mess, but I knew in this stint I wanted to change and get back on the right track.<br><br>And three years into my sentence, I came across a leaflet for a programme called ‘Evolve’, run by the company SBFM, a privately owned soft facilities management company.<br><br>It had launched Evolve to help provide sustainable employment opportunities and support for people from disadvantaged groups, raising individuals above the poverty line.</p>

    <p>Evolve work with people who traditionally struggle to find meaningful employment by offering tailored coaching and training. Candidates include ex-offenders, care leavers, the long-term unemployed, refugees, disabled people, and those experiencing homelessness.<br><br>When I heard of it while in prison, I initially thought this was just another fad, another marketing exercise. However, they were so hands on, approachable, and personable.<br><br>In February 2023 I was released from prison, and my support from SBFM led to meaningful work, without shame.<br><br>For the first time in my life, the employment support I was given wasn’t mixed with judgement, or employers making their mind up on who I was purely based on my past.<br><br>SBFM knew my entire conviction history and still secured me work as a cleaner, where I worked for a few months before moving on to the help desk.<br><br>In 2019, I couldn’t imagine ever being able to stay out of prison. But now, I’ve turned my life around and I can’t imagine ever going back.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
