    <p>A judge has quashed consent for two huge North Sea oil and gas projects in a ruling that campaigners claim casts doubt on the future of the industry.<br><br>Shell’s Jackdaw gas field and Equinor’s Rosebank oil field must now re-apply for government permission because their original approvals failed to consider the emissions that will be generated when the oil and gas are burnt.<br><br>Neither project will be able to start production unless consent is granted afresh but the companies have been allowed to continue development work in the meantime.<br><br>Wael Sawan, Shell’s chief executive, called on the government for urgent support to re-approve Jackdaw, which was originally granted consent in 2022 and is half built at a cost of about £800 million.<br><br>The gas field, about 155 miles east of Aberdeen, is due to start up in 2026 and provide enough gas to fuel 1.4 million homes. Sawan said it was a “critical piece of national infrastructure” to help Britain to avoid becoming more reliant on imports.<br><br>Rosebank, 80 miles northwest of Shetland, is owned by Equinor and Ithaca Energy. It is the largest untapped oil field in UK waters and was given consent in September 2023.<br><br>The campaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift brought the legal challenge appealing against the government’s decision to give consent to the Rosebank and Jackdaw projects.<br><br>A Supreme Court ruling last summer concluded that the impact assessments for new projects had to consider the effects of burning the oil and gas that is extracted from the fields.<br><br>• What the court ruling on North Sea oil and gas means for Scotland<br><br>The new verdict from Lord Ericht, at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, agreed that the initial approvals for Rosebank and Jackdaw were unlawful because they had not done so.<br><br>Shell and Equinor had argued that the consent for their projects should remain despite this but Ericht ruled against them. “The public interest in authorities acting lawfully and the private interest of members of the public in climate change outweigh the private interest of the developers,” he said.<br><br>Regulators must now reassess the projects in line with new guidance that the government is still finalising and is expected to publish this spring.<br><br>The fate of the fields will be a test of the government’s approach to the North Sea. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, has vowed to stop issuing new North Sea oil and gas licences and described Rosebank as a “colossal waste of taxpayer money and climate vandalism” while in opposition.<br><br>However, both Rosebank and Jackdaw received their licences years ago; the case centres instead on development permits for projects within existing licence areas.<br><br>• Pragmatism must prevail over ideology when it comes to North Sea<br><br>A spokeswoman for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “The government has already consulted on revised environmental guidance to take into account emissions from burning extracted oil and gas to provide stability for industry, support investment, protect jobs and deliver economic growth.<br><br>“We will respond to this consultation as soon as possible and developers will be able to apply for consents under this revised regime. Our priority is to deliver a fair, orderly and prosperous transition in the North Sea in line with our climate and legal obligations, which drives towards our clean energy future of energy security, lower bills and good, long-term jobs.”<br><br>Analysts at Stifel, the investment bank, said they did not expect the assessment of emissions to result in the reversal of the previous decisions to approve the projects and believed the ruling would have “no impact”.<br><br>However, Gail Anderson, a research director at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said the ruling was likely to result in longer lead times to approve projects “which will not help UK supply and energy security”.<br><br>Sawan told The Times that the Ericht ruling was a “mixed verdict” and Shell was pleased that it had not been forced to halt work. He called for the government to provide “the appropriate signals that continue to give us the confidence to invest”.</p>

    <p>He added: “We would really hope that the government now leans in and supports us in building what we continue to believe is a critical piece of national infrastructure.<br><br>“The chancellor is rightly talking about support for growth in the economy. The majority of growth is enabled by energy. In a world where today gas storage levels are at five-year lows, we have a project here that could potentially heat 1.4 million homes in the UK from domestic North Sea gas … rather than importing that gas. It’s a slam dunk for me and I really hope that we get the urgent support from the government to be able to now issue the license and allow us to move ahead.”<br><br>He said gas was “a core part of what the UK will need” in its future energy mix and he believed that there was “a very high likelihood that the government will see that and I’m hopeful will provide the right support for it rather than incentivising more imports”.<br><br>In June last year the UK Supreme Court ruled in favour of the campaigner Sarah Finch that Surrey county council’s approval of the Horse Hill onshore drilling project was unlawful as the “scope 3” emissions — those generated by the consumers of the energy products — had not been considered as part of the environmental impact assessment.<br><br>The judicial review of consent for Rosebank and Jackdaw was held in Edinburgh in November last year after Greenpeace and Uplift brought forward their cases.<br><br>Philip Evans, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace UK, described the verdict as a “historic win” for environmentalists.<br><br>He said: “The age of governments approving new drilling sites by ignoring their climate impacts is over. The courts have agreed with what climate campaigners have said all along: Rosebank and Jackdaw are unlawful and their full climate impacts must now be properly considered.<br><br>“Fossil fuels are an economic dead end. Now that the ball is back in the government’s court, ministers have the opportunity to sort out the legal mess left by their predecessors. They should use this moment to set out a new path for the North Sea, reaffirming their commitment to no new oil and gas and prioritising clean energy.”<br><br>Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, said: “Rosebank is a bad deal for the UK. Most of its oil will be exported and sold on the international market, doing nothing to lower our energy bills or boost UK energy security.<br><br>“If Equinor and Ithaca Energy try to push Rosebank through despite this ruling, the government must reject it. To do otherwise would undermine its ambitious clean growth plans by sending a signal to investors that the UK isn’t serious about transitioning away from expensive oil and gas.”<br><br>Douglas Lumsden, the energy and net-zero spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives, said: “This decision is a hammer blow for the North Sea oil and gas industry, which is so crucial for our economy and energy security.”<br><br>Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen &amp; Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: “Allowing work on Jackdaw and Rosebank to continue is a victory for common sense and averts what could have been an international embarrassment for the UK on energy security and investment.”<br><br>A Shell spokesman said: “Today’s ruling rightly allows work to progress on this nationally important energy project while new consents are sought. Swift action is needed from the government so that we and other North Sea operators can make decisions about vital UK energy infrastructure.<br><br>“When operational, Jackdaw would provide enough fuel to heat 1.4 million UK homes, at a time when older gas fields are reaching the end of their production and the UK is reliant on imported gas to meet its energy needs.”<br><br>Equinor said it was pleased with the ruling as it allowed Rosebank to move forward while awaiting new consents. It said Equinor and Ithaca had committed £2.2 billion towards developing the licence.<br><br>It added: “We welcome the court’s judgment, which enables Equinor to continue developing a project expected to create up to 2,000 UK jobs during its development phase.”</p>
