    <p>PRIMARY: Greta Thunberg and 20 other protesters were arrested after blocking the entrance to the Intercontinental Hotel Park Lane, disrupting the Energy Intelligence Forum oil and gas conference. The protesters linked arms, chanted, banged drums, and set off flares to prevent access to the venue. Thunberg demanded to &quot;kick oily money out of politics&quot; and called for direct action to stop fossil fuel industry meetings with politicians.<br><br>SECONDARY: Greenpeace activists separately rappelled down the hotel building to unfurl a &quot;Make big oil pay&quot; banner. Fossil Free London has planned additional protests throughout the week, including a &quot;Festival of Resistance&quot; and &quot;Rave and Resist&quot; events.</p>
