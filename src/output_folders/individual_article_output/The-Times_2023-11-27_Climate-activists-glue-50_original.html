        <h1>Climate activists glue 50 Barclays branches shut</h1><h2>Money Rebellion wants customers to boycott the bank because it invests in fossil fuel projects</h2><p>A group linked to Extinction Rebellion has forced the closure of 50 branches of Barclays Bank after activists superglued their doors shut.<br><br>Supporters of Money Rebellion, a “sister organisation” of XR, disabled the entrances of branches in Tottenham Court Road in London, Kilmarnock Road in Glasgow and Albion Street in Leeds.<br><br>Activists urged customers to boycott the company to exert pressure on Barclays to stop funding fossil fuel projects.<br><br>The bank has previously been targeted by Greenpeace, which claims it is the largest funder of fossil fuels in Europe. It has demanded the bank switch to supporting renewable energy projects.<br><br>A spokesman for Money Rebellion said the disruption was “part of a significant new wave of property-focused climate action. Climate change is real and happening now. We urge Barclays customers to use their power by moving their account to a bank more aligned with a liveable future for the planet.”<br><br>According to Bank.Green, which campaigns for banks to fund green projects, Barclays has invested $190.6 billion in fossil fuels in the seven years since the Paris agreement on climate change.<br><br>Barclays has previously said it will stop financing all oil sands and tar sands companies as well as new oil sands pipelines.<br><br>A Money Rebellion activist who took part in the action said: “Barclays are pumping billions into the fossil fuel industry, completely at odds with advice from the International Energy Agency, United Nations and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Barclays are choosing short-term profits over a liveable future and a lot of us are sick of the measly progress they’re making, as they hide behind their lies and greenwash.”</p><p>An XR activist added: “We’re responding to public attitudes and targeting the perpetrators of climate breakdown, not ordinary people and we apologise for any inconvenience caused to staff and customers. The inconvenience we’ve caused this morning is small in comparison to the catastrophic events already happening due to Barclays’ financing of fossil fuels.”<br><br>A Barclays spokesperson said: “Aligned to our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, we believe we can make the greatest difference by working with our clients as they transition to a low-carbon business model, reducing their carbon-intensive activity whilst scaling low-carbon technologies, infrastructure and capacity.<br><br>“We have set 2030 targets to reduce the emissions we finance in five high-emitting sectors, including the energy sector, where we have achieved a 32 per cent reduction since 2020. In addition, to scale the needed technologies and infrastructure, we have provided £99 billion of green finance since 2018, and have a target to facilitate $1 trillion in sustainable and transition financing between 2023 and 2030.”</p></body></html>
