    <p>It’s been 20 years since Love Actually released its brand of confetti-laden Christmas into the world, taking audiences on a romantic whirlwind through a group of interconnected characters’ love lives and subsequently cementing its status as a festive favourite.<br><br>A staple to rewatch every December.<br><br>Well, for some people – but not me.<br><br>I’m not here to tell anyone what they should and shouldn’t watch this Christmas, but there is something that grinds my gears about the ubiquitous nature of the film at this time of year.<br><br>Not only is it not the best Christmas movie, it’s not even the best movie by Richard Curtis, the rom-com King behind hits like Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral.<br><br>Firstly, it’s no secret that the film has not aged well.<br><br>I’d like to think everyone now cringes at the entire character arc of Martine McCutcheon’s Natalie being built around her apparent ‘chubbiness’, which is commented on by multiple men, including the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant).<br><br>It’s also upsetting that I thought nothing of that and McCutcheon’s distinctly non ‘tree-trunk’ thighs when watching this film as a young girl.<br><br>Then there’s the rather creepy profession of Andrew Lincoln’s character Mark’s love for his best friend’s wife Juliet (Keira Knightley), which is framed as romance at its finest – but can you even *imagine* the toxic dumpster fire of that going down in real life?<br><br>Plus the fact that, as one of her earlier roles, Knightley was 18 when this was released, to Lincoln’s 30.<br><br>That’s extremely problematic, but it seems to get missed in the context of Love Actually’s twinkly light-strewn street scene, soundtracked with a version of Silent Night I never want to hear again.<br><br>There’s also the worrying lack of diversity among the cast, with the overwhelming majority of people on screen depicted as white and hetrosexual – something even Curtis himself has acknowledged makes him feel ‘uncomfortable and a bit stupid’ now.<br><br>But that’s not all that should make him feel a bit stupid.<br><br>Personally, I’ve never understood the fuss from people who love Rowan Atkinson’s unfunny cameo as the jewellery salesman who takes forever to wrap Harry’s (Alan Rickman) adulterous necklace gift for Mia (Heike Makatsch).<br><br>I love Rowan, and especially his prior collaboration with Curtis on Blackadder. But the scene everyone seems to rave about is just stressful, annoying and not remotely amusing.<br><br>And also, Harry is quite clearly presiding over a workplace just inches from a harassment lawsuit, given his affair with his secretary and misbehaviour at the office party.<br><br>Not very romantic is it?<br><br>I’m not just a hater – I will freely admit that Love Actually also has funny moments and some positive attributes too. I’m not going to launch a full assassination attempt on the movie that brought us the joy of Bill Nighy’s swaggeringly awful Billy Mack, or Dame Emma Thompson’s devastating reaction to her husband’s betrayal.<br><br>And which British viewer hasn’t quietly fantasised over the section where dad dancer extraordinaire PM David publicly stands up against the sleazy US President, played by Billy Bob Thornton?<br><br>The overall issue with Love Actually though is its hollowness, like it’s had its soul sucked out, in comparison to some of Curtis’s other efforts.<br><br>It also sells an overly glossy, surface-level Christmas that doesn’t really reflect the celebrations most of us have in the UK.<br><br>It feels like unwrapping the most lavishly gift-wrapped (*cough* Rowan Atkinson) present as a child, only to find a pair of socks. Or a Joni Mitchell CD.</p>

    <p>And you don’t even have to dive too far into Curtis’s back catalogue to find true heart and soul.<br><br>That’s why I never look any further than the absolutely underrated About Time.<br><br>The last feature film that he wrote and also directed, which coincidentally turned 10 earlier this year, contains a father-son relationship between Bill Nighy and Domhnall Gleeson that is more poignant than anything in Love Actually.<br><br>It’s all about treasuring the moments with your loved ones as you have them, without knowing what the future holds, reminding us to consider them as precious as they are.<br><br>Or there’s Four Weddings and A Funeral, a nostalgic 90s classic, which is again relatable thanks to the madness of wedding season once you hit a certain age.<br><br>It also did seem progressive for the time with its inclusion of a gay relationship between John Hannah and Simon Callow’s characters.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times. Then, one day, he opened his front door and started walking.
