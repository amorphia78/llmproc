    <p>A WAX figure of French president Emmanuel Macron was yesterday stolen by Greenpeace activists — then used in an anti-Russia protest.<br><br>The £35,000 depiction of the 47-year-old head of state has often been compared to a Thunderbird puppet, or a Ken and Barbie doll.<br><br>Two women and a man disguised as staff took the £35,000 model from Paris’s Grevin Museum.<br><br>They placed the figure in front of the Russian embassy, urging France to halt gas and fertiliser imports from Moscow.<br><br>Greenpeace’s Jean-Francois Julliard said: “France is playing a double game.<br><br>&quot;Macron embodies this. He supports Ukraine but encourages French firms to continue trading with Russia.”<br><br>When it was created in 2018, even museum staff admitted the Macron waxwork did not look much like Mr Macron.<br><br>Grevin&#x27;s director, Yves Delhommeau, said: “A tense and anguished face, a frozen statue that doesn&#x27;t live, this is not beautiful, it is something that just doesn&#x27;t work.”</p>

    <p>Mr Delhommeau said President Macron did not meet with them in order to scan his face, so sculptors were forced to work with pictures of the 40-year-old.<br><br>Others went online to ridicule the model, saying it was one of the worst depictions of a public figure ever made.<br><br>The Grevin Museum is often compared to Madame Tussauds, the wax museum founded in London in 1835 by the French sculptor Marie Tussaud.<br><br>Like the British version, Grevin displays the waxworks of numerous famous figures from around the world.<br><br>Both museums are massive tourist attractions, with hundreds of thousands of visitors enjoying the waxworks every year.</p>
