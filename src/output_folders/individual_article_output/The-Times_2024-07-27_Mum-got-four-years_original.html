    <p>As a young woman, few things worried Louise Lancaster more than the idea of letting people down or doing something embarrassing. Having been one of the co-organisers of the protest that reduced parts of the M25 to gridlock over four days in November 2022, it seems that in later life she managed to overcome those challenges.<br><br>“For the woman I married to become the woman she is now, she’s had to go against the principles she was raised with,” says her former husband Tim Lancaster. “To get to the stage where she could face off a police officer and risk arrest … all of that was hard for her. Really hard. The fact she was going to inconvenience people was the most difficult part. She wouldn’t have done it if she’d been able to see another way.”<br><br>Together for 28 years until their amicable split last year, Tim, 57, who worked in IT, and Louise, 58, a special educational needs co-ordinator before her retirement two years ago, became involved in climate change activism in 2019. They joined marches, signed petitions and wrote to their local MP.<br><br>“For a while we thought people were noticing,” Tim says. “But Lou said to me, ‘Look, we did all of that and nothing changed — we have to do something else.’ Around 2020 she started to see non-violent direct action as a way of getting the government’s attention. “Lou studied maths at Oxford. She looks at data and she works things out. She thought about it very carefully.”<br><br>Handing down record sentences for non-violent protest earlier this month, Judge Christopher Hehir told the court that Louise and her co-conspirators, Roger Hallam, 58, Daniel Shaw, 38, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, and Cressida Gethin, 22, had “some time ago … crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic” before they attended a Zoom meeting in which they planned to recruit 45 volunteers to climb gantries over the M25.<br><br>The judge described the protest as causing “massive disruption”, including missed exams, funerals and cancer appointments. It allegedly cost the Met Police £1.1m and impacted around 700,000 vehicles, leaving the motorway “compromised” for more than 120 hours. Lancaster did not herself take part, but she had climbed a gantry on the M25 in an earlier protest in July 2022.<br><br>On the Zoom call, Hallam, the co-founder of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, said that they intended to cause “the biggest disruption in British modern history” in an effort to force the government to meet one of Just Stop Oil’s core demands: an end to new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.<br><br>In a decision that has provoked fierce debate, Hallam was jailed for five years for compromising to cause a public nuisance, while Louise, who paid more than £1,000 to rent the Airbnb where protesters stayed, and also bought climbing equipment, was sentenced to four, along with Shaw, Whittaker De Abreu and Gethin.<br><br>With Tim on our video call on Thursday night are the couple’s three grown-up children. Tristan, 27, is a software engineer; Verity, 25, is a midwife; and Theo, 19, is a medical student. They are bunched together, legs dangling off the edge of a single bed in the family home in the village of Grantchester, near Cambridge. Tim and Louise divorced in November but remain good friends.<br><br>“Whenever I think of my mum I think: unrelentingly kind,” Theo says. “In almost any situation she will put others first.”</p>

    <p>Tristan, Theo and Tim visited Louise in Bronzefield, a female prison that houses category-A prisoners in Surrey, on Monday afternoon. “I’d had an interview for a summer job and the first thing she asked was, ‘How did it go?’” Theo says. “With me being the youngest, she has always been very open about what might happen and took into account my thoughts. She cares about us — if we’d said, ‘Mum, don’t do it,’ she wouldn’t have taken part.”<br><br>Verity visited the previous Tuesday, two days before the sentencing on July 18, along with Louise’s worried elderly father, a retired art teacher with whom, Tim says, she has had some pretty fiery exchanges. “He said he felt her activism has ‘let the family down’.”<br><br>“I gave her a hug and then burst into tears,” Verity says. “Mum broke into a massive smile and said, ‘I’m going to be fine.’ She told me she’d been helping other women filling out forms and she was going to do some online courses and work on her pull-ups.” Her brothers fall about laughing at this. “It’s very not-Mum.”<br><br>“She expected that this might happen,” Tim explains, “and she prepared herself and everyone else for it.” Nonetheless the family was shocked at the length of the sentence. “To get a sentence that is way longer than you’d get for violent crime [the average UK sentence for violent crime is 21.6 months]. It feels terribly unjust.” The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 allows such harsher punishments to be imposed.<br><br>Under the Public Order Act 2023, provisions also came into effect earlier this year that give the police more power to clamp down on disruptive protests. Did they not wish that Louise had done something else? Lobbying parliament perhaps? Or chaining herself to railings? “She has — and it hasn’t been enough,” Tristan insists. “Big Oil has known for decades that burning fossil fuels is dangerous but has carried on regardless, and successive governments have done nothing to stop it.”<br><br>The family is not sure if there will be an appeal against the sentences, but so far a crowdfunder has raised £60,000 to pay for legal fees. The cost would be hundreds of thousands of pounds. Instead they are pinning their hopes on the new government looking at the law. “I never thought as an Englishman I’d ever see rules as draconian as this in my country,” Tim says. “But Lou is resigned to doing her time.”<br><br>Louise was initially struggled to get any vegan protein or exercise in prison. But speaking to her on Friday, Tim reported back that she had at last received some suitable food.<br><br>In the course of her activism, Louise has incurred fines of more than £20,000, which she will struggle to pay off. She’s been strip-searched, handcuffed face-down and the house has been raided more than once by police. The emotional cost to the family is high. “Johnny and I are getting married next summer, Mum’s gutted to miss it. Maybe she’ll get out with a tag and she can wear a long dress,” Verity says, a little too brightly.<br><br>Tim describes Louise as a sensitive soul, someone who “listens more than she speaks”. Could Louise be in so deep she can’t see the wood for the trees? Verity says not. “She knew what she was putting people through. And it was a big moral dilemma. Her position was that there is a much bigger disaster at stake — if we don’t act quickly — than people being late for school and work.”</p>
