        <h1>Norway suspends controversial deep-sea mining plan</h1><p>Norway has paused its controversial project to open up its seabed for commercial-scale deep-sea mining.<br><br>Oslo had planned to let companies apply to mine 280,000 sq km (108,000 sq miles) of its waters for precious metals - an area bigger than the size of the UK.<br><br>The move was blocked after the country’s Socialist Left Party said it would not support the government’s budget unless it scrapped the first licensing round, set for 2025.<br><br>Environmental scientists had warned the move could be catastrophic for marine life, while the plans were opposed by 32 countries including France, Canada, Brazil and Germany.<br><br>Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoer called Sunday&#x27;s development a “postponement” and said preparatory work on regulations and environmental impact would continue.<br><br>Greenpeace Norway&#x27;s Haldis Tjeldflaat Helle said the pause was &quot;a huge win&quot;.<br><br>&quot;It has been truly embarrassing to watch Norway positioning itself as an ocean leader, while planning to give green light to ocean destruction in its own waters.&quot;<br><br>The country&#x27;s energy ministry has not yet commented.<br><br>Norway became the first country in the world to move forward with commercial-scale deep-sea mining when it approved the plans in January.<br><br>The deep sea is home to minerals such as lithium, scandium and cobalt - which are critical for green technologies.</p>

    <p>Although the metals are available on land, they are concentrated in a small number of countries, increasing the risk to supply.<br><br>Oslo said it did not want to rely on China for such materials, stressing it would only begin issuing licences once more environmental research was carried out.<br><br>The move put Norway at odds with the EU and the UK, which have called for a temporary ban on the practice due to concerns about environmental damage.<br><br>More than 100 EU lawmakers called on Oslo to reject the project, citing the risk &quot;to marine biodiversity and the acceleration of climate change&quot;.<br><br>The country’s Institute of Marine Research criticised the government’s research into the move&#x27;s environmental impact - saying five to 10 more years of work were needed.<br><br>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Norway said in a statement last week it was suing the government over the plans.<br><br>At least three Norwegian seabed mineral start-ups had said they would bid in the first licensing round.<br><br>On Monday, one of the start-ups - Green Minerals - said it expected a delay of up to a year following the plans&#x27; suspension.</p></body></html>
