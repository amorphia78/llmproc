    <p>Activists from Palestine Action are feared to have cost the government and firms making equipment for the British military as much as £55 million.<br><br>In a five-year campaign Palestine Action has conducted 356 attacks on sites across the UK, culminating in a raid on RAF Brize Norton last week in which two Voyager aircraft were damaged.<br><br>The attacks have cost the defence industry at least £30 million, according to evidence submitted to the government by several firms that have been affected.<br><br>But it is also feared that one engine of a plane attacked at Brize Norton is damaged beyond repair and could cost £25 million to replace. While the extent of the damage is still being investigated, it is feared that red paint sprayed in to the turbine of the engine may mean it cannot be safely used again.<br><br>Other costs are believed to cover repairs to warehouses, research facilities and factories, lost working time from the disruption, and the extra security the firms have been forced to invest in to ward off criminal activity by Palestine Action.<br><br>The firms have also warned the Ministry of Defence that the group’s activities have now extended to smaller firms in their supply chains, which will struggle to afford extra security and repairs.<br><br>Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is set to proscribe Palestine Action on Monday, but an influential group of peers wants the law toughened to make it easier for the police to stop all kinds of “organisations which cause destruction”.<br><br>There have been growing concerns about the ability of the police to combat extreme protest groups such as Palestine Action.<br><br>Lord Walney, the government’s former extremism adviser, will table an amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, which is currently making its way through the House of Lords, to give the police more powers to stop the activities of groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Youth Demand.<br><br>An investigation by The Sunday Times in March revealed how activists had switched between protest groups which were also sharing tactics.<br><br>If implemented the new law would restrict a group’s ability to fundraise and its right to assembly in the UK. It could stop them posting on social media and live-streaming actions that they take.<br><br>An extreme protest group would be defined as an organisation which routinely uses criminal tactics to try to achieve its aims.<br><br>Although Palestine Action will be proscribed under existing terror laws, Walney’s peers believe a new legal mechanism is required to tackle extreme political, environmental and animal rights groups “who fall just below the threshold of being terrorist organisations”.</p>

    <p>His “criminal protest proscription” amendment would represent a major overhaul in how such groups are policed in the UK. Walney plans to table the amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, which has reached the House of Lords, in coming weeks.<br><br>“The police need new powers to be able to tackle and disrupt extreme protest groups like Palestine Action, who have been allowed to cause mayhem and destruction for the past five years,” Walney said.<br><br>“Many of these groups fall just below the threshold required to be considered a terrorist organisation. We need a new mechanism to help police disrupt these extreme protests which are causing real harm to hundreds of businesses across the country.”<br><br>• Melanie Phillips: Palestine Action is a terrorist group, so ban it<br><br>His proposal is expected to have support from up to 42 peers who have this weekend signed a letter sent to Cooper asking for a meeting to discuss how to “prevent or disrupt further attacks”.<br><br>The letter, signed by peers including Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale, a former assistant head of MI6; Baroness Berger, a prominent Jewish peer; Lord Evans of Sealand, a former Labour general secretary; and Lord Cryer, the former chairman of the parliamentary Labour party, says that Palestine Action has been allowed to carry out a “sustained aggressive broad campaign that undermines the rule of law and Britain’s national security”.<br><br>Research by The Sunday Times reveals there have been 356 direct actions on British-based defence and engineering firms, banks, insurance companies, estate agents and property companies, accountancy firms, universities and local government buildings owing to alleged links to Israel.<br><br>Some 118 Palestine Action activists were convicted of criminal offences between 2020 and 2024 for attacks on British-based companies linked to Israel, with 33 found not guilty of offences at trial. There are 17 trials continuing relating to direct action protests by Palestine Action.<br><br>John Healey, the defence secretary, said he was “really disturbed” by the breach of RAF Brize Norton and has ordered an investigation and wider security review.<br><br>Counterterrorism police officers are investigating the incident, with Thames Valley police and the Ministry of Defence police.<br><br>A Palestine Action spokesman said: “Despite publicly condemning the Israeli government, Britain continues to send military cargo, fly spyplanes over Gaza and refuel US and Israeli fighter jets.”</p>
