        <h1>I took part in a steamy 20-person orgy – all without leaving the sofa</h1><p>Running around our empty apartment, my partner and I excitedly tried to get everything ready.<br><br>We swigged Aldi cocktail tinnies as we balanced the laptop precariously on a stool, jewellery box and a library of books.<br><br>We giggled nervously as we pulled on our masks. And must have spent around 10 minutes ensuring we had the perfect lighting.<br><br>This may sound overboard for a Zoom call, but we wanted to make an impression. After all, it’s not everyday you join an orgy online.<br><br>My partner and I aren’t ones to shy away from spicing up our sex life. We’ve visited real world sex clubs while travelling, shared our fantasies and watched porn as a couple.<br><br>Getting out of your comfort zone is all part of having a fun sex life together.<br><br>So when a friend of a friend told us about the sex club Killing Kittens, our interest piqued. We weren’t able to go to any of their in-person events but saw that it was hosting a Zoom orgy, the event listing promising ‘a few flirty, fun games’ before they set us free to ‘play’ with each other.<br><br>We figured we’d give it a go. How different could it be from a real sex club anyway?<br><br>The day of the orgy had been like any other – I worked from home and joined plenty of Zoom meetings, as always. It was weird to think that in a few hours I’d be doing the same, but without any clothes on.<br><br>We set up excitedly and then, as we waited to be let into the call, put on our masks.<br><br>This is required to hide your identity, so we’d bought the cheapest possible options from a local fancy dress shop.<br><br>I donned a burglar mask while my partner wore a lace eye mask.<br><br>Unfortunately, I’d left my full name and picture attached to my Zoom account.<br><br>Gradually, couples stripped off one-by-one, until there were more dick, balls, boobs, arse, and vulvas on my laptop than it had ever seen<br><br>I was able to exit and rejoin but it was an amusing start to our night to think I nearly messed up the whole thing before even getting going.<br><br>Peaches, our host, popped up on screen and welcomed us to the event. Music that would fit on the 50 Shades of Grey soundtrack played in the background as gradually more and more cameras turned on.<br><br>Despite everyone’s masks, you could see the crowd’s diversity. There were older couples, younger couples, and solo women. Single men weren’t allowed; they can be a nuisance at these types of events, and the environment definitely felt more open in their absence.<br><br>My partner and I looked at each other reassuringly. This was very different to anything we’d done before, but we were really excited.<br><br>The last couple to join were about five minutes late and surprisingly were not wearing any masks. They were giggling away to each other though and I surmised they’d had a few drinks to steady their nerves.<br><br>Now we were all accounted for, the games could begin – literally.<br><br>We all had to start by saying what our favourite part of our partner was. It felt like a slightly less HR-friendly version of an icebreaker chat at work.<br><br>Then we had to give our partner a sexy lapdance or kiss each other head to toe. I’m not sure what the single women were doing – my partner and I were engrossed in each other by this point!<br><br>Yes, the icebreaker games were cringe, but they were crucial in loosening us all up.<br><br>After an hour or so the games were over and the real fun could begin. We were free to sexually explore our partners in any way we’d like.<br><br>Getting out of your comfort zone is all part of having a fun sex life together<br><br>Peaches explained that she would be spotlighting couples, meaning she would pin one particular couple’s feed to the screen. After that, we would be free to pin the couples we wanted to watch ourselves.<br><br>We didn’t feel fully prepared, so agreed to sit back and watch for a moment but others clearly didn’t feel so shy.</p>

    <p>One couple was already going at it before Peaches had even finished her sentence.<br><br>Gradually, couples stripped off one-by-one, until there were more dick, balls, boobs, arse, and vulvas on my laptop than it had ever seen.<br><br>My partner and I picked out our favourite couples. We took particular liking to one couple, who were sitting naked on their sofa – and the giggly couple from earlier who were now having sex in missionary – and steadily got into the mood ourselves.<br><br>We started having sex, after some brief foreplay, while constantly checking the laptop to see who was on screen. It was so hot to essentially have a live porn show happening while we had sex.<br><br>Eventually it was our turn to be spotlighted. ‘We’re on the screen!’ I whispered to my partner.<br><br>Seeing ourselves on camera like that, knowing other people were watching, felt great. It might not be to everyone’s liking but it really fed into our desires.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.

And while some couples organised an after party of sorts, my partner and I politely declined – no Zoom meeting should be longer than two hours.<br><br>I closed my laptop and we walked to the kitchen (still naked, mind) for a glass of water. Between gulps we couldn’t help but laugh at how crazy our night had been.<br><br>Two minutes ago we were part of a 20 person orgy, now we were in an empty apartment.<br><br>The whole thing was a great experience and a great way to spice it up in the bedroom – although we both agreed that nothing’s better than doing it in real life.<br><br>However, it did make us want to give a sex club in the UK a try.
