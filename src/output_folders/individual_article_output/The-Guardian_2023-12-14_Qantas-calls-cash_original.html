    <p>This blog is now closed<br><br>Queensland emergency personnel are providing a post-Tropical Cyclone Jasper update to the media from Brisbane.<br><br>They said far north Queensland has seen 24-hour rainfall totals of about half a metre, with heavy rain continuing from Ingham down to Cooktown. As we flagged just earlier, more than 40,000 homes and businesses are without power, including around 25,000 in Cairns.<br><br>That means a quarter of homes and businesses in the affected areas have no power this morning.<br><br>Emergency personnel said twelve people, and a dog, were rescued from Mossman last night and are all safe.<br><br>With the rain continuing, we want to remind all Queenslanders that flooding and its impact on individuals, and the risk and the danger that comes from flooding, remains.<br><br>People in the far north will be aware that an event like this is not over, because when they look outside they can see the rain bucketing down. But it will ease up and we want people to remain alert and safe at this time.<br><br>By comparison: AIC deaths in custody data for 2021-22<br><br>Following on from our last post, here is the AIC data on deaths in custody from the 2021-22 period, for comparison:<br><br>106 deaths in custody (2022-23: 110 deaths in custody)<br><br>84 of these were in prison custody and 22 were in police custody or custody-related operations (2022-23: 70 deaths in prison custody and 40 deaths in police custody or custody-related operations)<br><br>24 Indigenous deaths, 81 non-Indigenous deaths and one death of a person whose Indigenous status was not known (2022-23: 31 Indigenous deaths and 79 non-Indigenous deaths in custody)<br><br>AIC reports 110 deaths in custody in 2022-23<br><br>The Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) has released its annual report on deaths in custody. The report found that from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023, there were 110 deaths in custody.<br><br>70 of these were in prison custody, and 40 in police custody or custody-related operations. There were 31 Indigenous deaths and 79 non-Indigenous deaths in custody.<br><br>AIC’s deputy director, Dr Rick Brown, said the Institute remains committed to providing accurate and policy-relevant research to assist in reducing the over-incarceration of First Nations people:<br><br>​Having timely and in-depth data is a key step towards informed early intervention and prevention strategies to reduce First Nations deaths in custody and improve justice outcomes.<br><br>In June 2023, the AIC began reporting real-time deaths in custody online, to help focus attention and bring additional transparency and accountability to this serious issue.<br><br>Lifeline 13 11 14<br><br>Nearly 40,000 homes and businesses in far north Queensland are without power this morning in the wake of ex-Tropical Cyclone Jasper, with no timeframe yet for when it will be restored.<br><br>A spokesperson for Ergon Energy said there is likely to be widespread network damage across several shires, including Cairns, Douglas, Cassowary Coast, Mareeba, Tablelands and Yarrabah.<br><br>Crews had started assessing the damage in areas where it is safe to do so – including in Cairns – but the spokesperson said the restoration of power across the affected regions would be complex:<br><br>There’s potentially a lot of damage over a widespread area and severe weather could hamper access to sites, so we need to set realistic community expectations.<br><br>The network will prioritise restoring power to essential services like water, sewerage, health services and shopping centres.<br><br>Greenpeace Australia files lawsuit against Woodside Petroleum<br><br>Greenpeace Australia has filed a lawsuit against fossil fuel giant Woodside in the federal court overnight.<br><br>In a statement, Greenpeace said it was bringing the case forward over climate change concerns. Greenpeace alleges that Woodside has been misrepresenting its climate performance and plans.<br><br>Amongst other claims, Greenpeace alleges that Woodside said it had cut its climate pollution from extracting and processing its gas and oil by 11% in 2022, but it relied on “carbon offsets” and its actual emissions went up by more than 3%.<br><br>Woodside has been contacted for comment.<br><br>‘Massive cleanup’ expected in areas hit by Tropical Cyclone Jasper<br><br>Residents of Cow Bay, north of Port Douglas, say they expect a “massive cleanup” in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Jasper, which is expected to flood creeks and rivers and even uproot trees.<br><br>The cyclone hit an area of coastline dotted with small communities with limited access.<br><br>Residents report that the Daintree river has already reached 4 metres.<br><br>Police union to vote on stepping up industrial action<br><br>Police in Victoria will vote on whether to step up industrial action as a bitter pay dispute threatens to drag into the new year, AAP reports.<br><br>If the ballot is successful, officers would no longer penalise most speeding drivers, refuse to appear in court and stop taking on extra duties. That could impact policing arrangements at the Australian Open tennis as officers currently volunteer to take on extra shifts to cover major events.<br><br>The Police Association of Victoria has been pushing for a 4% pay rise and better conditions such as nine hour shifts during five months of negotiations. Up to 18,000 officers have already imposed work bans, which include attempts to slash state government revenue from lucrative speeding fines and writing messages on police vehicles.</p>

    <p>The association’s secretary, Wayne Gatt, said his members did not want to escalate action but had no alternative as there had been no negotiations in December.<br><br>Under the proposed action, officers would stop issuing penalty notices except for drink or drug driving and serious offences that trigger an immediate loss or suspension of a licence. The further 18 proposed work bans include stopping extra duties, such as taking on extra shifts to police major events and refusing to to appear as informants or witnesses at the supreme and county courts.<br><br>Burns on Israel-Gaza: ‘ceasefire cannot be one-sided’<br><br>Josh Burns was asked whether he believes prime minister Anthony Albanese is “trying to be all things to all people”, like members of the opposition have claimed.<br><br>Burns disagreed with this and said Albanese has a “deep sense of the region [and] the conflict”.<br><br>I know that [Labor frontbencher Ed Husic] is is deeply concerned about his [Muslim] community, as am I deeply concerned about my [Jewish] community. It’s a natural part of a conflict that there are going to be people concerned about the loss of life and the human cost of it.<br><br>What is our humanity if we can’t recognise that there is suffering on both sides? I think that I think that to make it too binary is unnecessary.<br><br>I’ve made my position clear about the fact that I completely understand that a state that is responding to a terror organisation is seeking to protect its citizens, and I completely reiterate the point that a ceasefire cannot be one-sided, and I will continue to do so, and I believe that that is unfortunately a very difficult, but the right position, to hold.<br><br>I also think that, I don’t want to see innocent lives lost. I don’t and I never will and I will never celebrate the loss of life.<br><br>Labor’s Josh Burns says Israel will not accept anything less than the return of hostages and the removal of Hamas from power<br><br>Circling back to the cross-party delegation to the Middle East which is being led by the shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham: Labor backbencher Josh Burns is visiting Israel as part of the delegation and spoke to ABC RN earlier this morning about his experience.<br><br>Turning to the growing calls for a ceasefire – after the PM signed a joint letter urging one and Australia voted in favour of an immediate ceasefire at the UN – Burns said any ceasefire would need to be “an agreement between two parties”, and that Hamas “cannot be a part of the future governance of Gaza”.<br><br>Q: Do you support Australia voting yes for this UN resolution?<br><br>Burns:<br><br>I think that the United States amendment of including Hamas in the resolution was an important one, and we voted in favour of that.<br><br>(The US amendment designated Hamas as a terrorist group, and called for wording to “unequivocally” condemn the 7 October attack and the taking of hostages. It was not passed).<br><br>Burns said it was “ludicrous” not to include Hamas in the resolution, but he also said the resolution “couldn’t be less relevant to the people here on the ground” who are focusing on “whether or not its safe to return to their homes”:<br><br>Israel is still committed to removing from Hamas from power and Israel is still committed to the return of hostages. So the UN can pass resolutions but those two key factors haven’t changed on the ground and as much as I think that the UN resolution really would have been strengthened by the United States [amendment], what’s really important here is that there are meaningful steps towards towards the end of this violence and that can’t happen without Hamas releasing hostages, and it won’t happen without Hamas being removed from power.<br><br>The Israelis will not accept anything else and as much as we might want to pray and wish for a return to the situation prior to October 7, the reality is is that those two key aspects are still in the way of a peaceful future.<br><br>Heatwave conditions predicted across Australia<br><br>Turning back to some more weather news, and large parts of the country are still experiencing heatwave conditions.<br><br>In NSW, a severe heatwave warning remains in place for the Northern Rivers, Mid North Coast, Hunter, Northern Tablelands and South Coast Districts. Maximum temperatures are expected to be in the mid to high 30s, with heatwave conditions moving north by the weekend and continuing into next week.<br><br>Meanwhile, the NSW Rural Fire Service has issued total fire ban’s for the Hunter and Greater Sydney. Sydney is forecast to reach a max of 37C today.<br><br>In Queensland, a heatwave is expected to develop in the southeast from today and continue through the weekend. Brisbane is forecast to reach a max of 34C today.<br><br>In Western Australia, there is an extreme heatwave warning for the Kimberly district, with mid 40 conditions expected to continue into next week.<br><br>And in the Northern Territory, a severe heatwave warning is in place for the Tiwi, Arnhem, Carpentaria, Gregory, Barkly and Tanami districts. Darwin is forecast to reach a max of 35C today, with a possible storm.</p>
