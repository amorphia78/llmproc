        <h1>Frasier was loved because of one character – the reboot is a flop without him</h1>

    <p>TV revivals are everywhere these days.<br><br>In the past few years alone Sex and the City, Gilmore Girls, Roseanne and Will and Grace are among those to have been given an update.<br><br>And while I may have tuned in for an episode or two of those rebooted sitcoms, nothing got me more excited than hearing about the revival of the beloved show from my teenage years, Frasier.<br><br>I LOVED Frasier. And not just the ‘never missing an episode’ kind of love.<br><br>I’m talking about taping (yes, I’m old) all episodes and re-watching back-to-back, writing scenarios about the characters of the Cheers spin-off in my diary and even forcing myself to love coffee to suit the café culture of Seattle.<br><br>So yeah, I was, to put it mildly, obsessed.<br><br>From the moment I started watching the show aged 12, I was hooked. I loved the witty quips – even though some inevitably went over my head – and the heart of the characters.<br><br>And one in particular.<br><br>Unlike many girls my age growing up in the mid-90s, I didn’t have posters of Take That or Leo Di Caprio adorning my bedroom wall.<br><br>My affections lay elsewhere, in the world of Frasier. But it wasn’t the titular character of the show I was infatuated with. It was Niles Crane. It’s always been Niles.<br><br>And that’s why, no matter how much of the spirit of the original the new version of the show may retain, the absence of Niles (played by David Hyde Pierce) means it can, never, truly, be as good.<br><br>Without Niles, there’s a gaping hole at the reboot’s heart.<br><br>My strong and, some might say, slightly weird obsession with Frasier’s younger brother pretty much began from the beginning of watching the programme.<br><br>I loved Niles’ quick wit, his pompous put-downs, and fierce loyalty to his family. In fact, I was such a fan that a framed photo of the blond psychiatrist took pride of place on my bedside table. I think both of the show’s psychiatrists would find me an interesting patient.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.

    <p>The way they praised each other was so wholesome and lovely that there was no doubt in my mind that, if the then-rumoured revival were to happen, David Hyde Pierce would be very much involved.<br><br>When the exciting announcement was made, I assumed that the full cast – minus John Mahoney who played dad Martin and passed away in 2018 – would be taking part. But, alas, I was disappointed.<br><br>Hyde Pierce said early on that he had no interest in doing a repeat of his old performance.<br><br>While I respect his decision, I’m still gutted. I wanted to see Niles as the father of a college-age son, I wanted to see him and Daphne still blissfully happy and witness his transaction from uptight socialite spouse to mellow family man.<br><br>Despite the lack of Niles, I couldn’t resist giving the new show a watch. The music and skyline intro in the first new episode made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up – it felt like Frasier.<br><br>Until it didn’t.<br><br>Being an only child, I was always drawn to the dynamic of brothers Frasier and Niles. They loved each other but their sibling rivalry added so much to the show – something that the new version is sorely missing.<br><br>Frasier needs Niles to compete with and to antagonise. However successful either of them gets, the other was always there to knock them down a few pegs.<br><br>Hyde Pierce’s chemistry with Kelsey Grammer’s Frasier made them one of TV’s greatest double-acts.Despite the show being called Frasier, Niles was always the lead in my mind, stealing virtually every scene.<br><br>In the new adaptation we do have Niles’ and Daphne’s son, David. He was born on the final episode of the original run so we never saw the couple deal with the early days of parenthood.<br><br>Anders Keith plays David pretty much exactly how I imagined him. He doesn’t have his dad’s pompous wit (inevitable with sunny-natured Daphne as his mother) but he does carry around a laminated list of his allergies and medication for all occasions, so a small part of Niles was there.<br><br>While the reboot won’t be nearly as special to me without my beloved Niles, I’ll still keep watching.<br><br>Clicking play on the first episode, I really didn’t have great expectations but was emotional towards the end.<br><br>So I’ll give it a chance – even without Niles.<br><br>Inside the £6,500,000 stately townhouse where Britain&#x27;s most powerful man grew up<br><br>Our dream doer-upper turned into a £200,000 nightmare<br><br>What I Own: We bought a two-bedroom ex-council property in Hackney for £400,000<br><br>I was duped into buying a rat-infested house — it cost us £6,450<br><br>The tiny UK city where almost 50% of people have no mortgage<br><br>I might just have to look at that framed picture.<br><br>Do you have a story you’d like to share?
