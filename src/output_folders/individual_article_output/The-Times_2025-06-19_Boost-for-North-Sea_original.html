    <p>Ed Miliband has moved to unblock the development of two controversial new North Sea oil and gas fields, setting out new criteria under which the projects can be approved.<br><br>The energy secretary has published legal guidance that will allow the owners of Rosebank oil field, near Shetland, and Shell’s Jackdaw gas field, near Aberdeen, to apply for permission to start drilling.<br><br>The two projects had been given the go-ahead under the previous government but were blocked by the courts after environmentalists successfully challenged their oil and gas production licences.<br><br>They argued that the government had failed to take into account the greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the oil and gas being burnt — rather than simply the emissions from production.<br><br>Since then, ministers have been redrafting the government’s guidance on assessing emissions in an attempt to provide certainty to the industry.<br><br>The changes could open the door for the energy giants to regain their licences and start producing oil and gas, with a decision expected as soon as the autumn.<br><br>Announcing the changes, Michael Shanks, the energy minister, said the guidance would offer “clarity on the way forward for the North Sea oil and gas industry” following the Supreme Court ruling.<br><br>“It marks a step forward in ensuring the full implications of oil and gas extraction are considered for potential projects and that we ensure a managed, prosperous, and orderly transition to the North Sea’s clean energy future, in line with the science,” he said.<br><br>“We are working with industry, trade unions, local communities and environmental groups to ensure the North Sea and its workers are at the heart of Britain’s clean energy future for decades to come — supporting well-paid, skilled jobs, driving growth and boosting our energy security.”<br><br>Jackdaw, a gas field 150 miles east of Aberdeen, is expected to account for 6 per cent of the UK’s entire gas output once it comes on stream — potentially supplying several million homes.<br><br>Rosebank, 60 miles northwest of Shetland, will produce mainly oil, which will be loaded into tankers and mostly exported, with the UK gaining from the taxes it generates.<br><br>However, the new rules could lead to approval for many other such developments, potentially including the giant Cambo oil field controlled by Ithaca, which is also involved in Rosebank.</p>

    <p>This is because the legal rulings that led to Rosebank and Jackdaw being blocked also froze the development of many other UK fields whose licences had been issued under the same flawed assessment system.<br><br>These are thought to include the next phase of BP’s Clair oil field and Serica Energy’s Buchan Horst field.<br><br>Martin Copeland, of Serica Energy, told the Telegraph he would welcome any such move by the government.<br><br>“These legal rulings have caused a hiatus across the North Sea,” he said. “It goes far wider than Rosebank and Jackdaw. There are many other smaller developments that have been held up, impacting the supply chain companies and all their workers.”<br><br>The green groups that brought the legal challenges that quashed approval for Rosebank and Jackdaw’s consent said the way Miliband ruled on any new applications in the autumn would be a test of the government’s climate change credentials.<br><br>“The new rules mean that oil and gas companies will finally be forced to come clean over the enormous harm they are causing to the climate,” said Tessa Khan, founder of campaign group Uplift.<br><br>“In the case of the Rosebank oil field, which Equinor can now seek reapproval for, it is overwhelmingly obvious that the project is incompatible with the UK’s climate commitments. Whether or not this government then follows the science and rejects Rosebank will be a real test of its climate credibility.”<br><br>Mel Evans, a campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “Approving these projects would be a political sleight of hand that would benefit oil giants like Equinor and Shell, while leaving us hooked on fossil fuels just as another war in the Middle East is pushing up oil prices.”<br><br>A spokesman for Equinor said: “We welcome clarity and can confirm that we will submit a downstream end user combustion emissions (‘Scope 3’) assessment in full compliance with the government’s new environmental guidance.”<br><br>A Shell spokesman said: “We are reviewing today’s guidance and remain committed to delivering Jackdaw, which is a nationally important energy project and supports the government’s growth agenda.”</p>
