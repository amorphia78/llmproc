    <p>Metropolitan police said the deepfake audio of Sadiq Khan &#x27;dismissing Remembrance Day commemorations&#x27; is &#x27;not a crime&#x27;.<br><br>A clip posted on TikTok, believed to have been created with artificial intelligence, used simulated audio to mimic Mr Khan saying: &#x27;I don&#x27;t give a flying s*** about the Remembrance weekend.&#x27;<br><br>Later, a second clip was circulated on the social media platform that simulated the Mayor stating his authority over the Met Police before suggesting that the Armistice Day commemorations be postponed.<br><br>It comes on the day that tens of thousands was seen marching through the streets carrying banners which read &#x27;free Palestine&#x27;, as some protesters let off flares in the capital city.<br><br>The fake audio added: &#x27;I know we have Armistice Day on Saturday, but why should Londoners cancel the Palestinian march on Saturday?<br><br>&#x27;Why don&#x27;t they have Remembrance weekend next weekend? What&#x27;s happening in Gaza is much bigger than this weekend and it&#x27;s current.&#x27;<br><br>A Met Police spokesman confirmed that the force had looked into the fake footage but would be taking no further action.<br><br>He said: &#x27;We can confirm that we were made aware of a video featuring artificial audio of the Mayor.<br><br>&#x27;Specialist officers have reviewed this video and assessed that it does not constitute a criminal offence.<br><br>&#x27;Officers from Counter Terrorism Policing continue to review online content and material that is referred to us by members of the public.<br><br>&#x27;We will investigate and take enforcement actions where criminal offences are identified.&#x27;<br><br>Mr Khan later took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to confirm the recording was fake and encouraged Londoners to &#x27;stand together&#x27;.<br><br>The Mayor posted: &#x27;While I hosted an interfaith Remembrance event with our armed forces at City Hall, the far-right were sharing deepfake audio about me.<br><br>&#x27;They may have new means, but their ends are the same - to divide our diverse communities.<br><br>&#x27;We must stand together - it&#x27;s what London does best.&#x27;<br><br>The technology behind deepfakes was developed in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, who was the the director of machine learning at Apple&#x27;s Special Projects Group and a leader in the field.</p>

    <p>The word stems from the collaboration of the terms &#x27;deep learning&#x27; and &#x27;fake,&#x27; and is a form of artificial intelligence.<br><br>The system studies a target person in pictures and videos, allowing it to capture multiple angles and mimic their behavior and speech patterns.<br><br>The technology gained attention during the election season, as many feared developers would use it to undermine political candidates&#x27; reputations.<br><br>Organisers of the pro-Palestinian protest in London said &#x27;more than 800,000&#x27; marched to the US embassy today to demand that Israel stops bombing Gaza - as they asked crowds to disperse peacefully.<br><br>A woman using a speaker system from the stage at the end of the &#x27;march for Palestine&#x27; said: &#x27;There are more than 800,000 of us here today and that number may be as high as one million. Making this the second largest march in British history.&#x27;<br><br>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: &#x27;They said we shouldn&#x27;t be marching on Remembrance weekend. Well, I simply say this: we march in memory of all those who died in all wars, in all conflicts.&#x27;<br><br>Chants of &#x27;free Palestine&#x27; and &#x27;ceasefire now&#x27; could be heard during the march. The Met, who put their numbers at 300,000, said those gathered had so far been peaceful, with no incidents reported.<br><br>This was in stark contrast to a march by thugs led by the far-right figure Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, which has seen repeated clashes with officers and missiles thrown at police.<br><br>Tens of thousands could be seen marching through the streets carrying banners which read &#x27;free Palestine&#x27;, as some protesters let off flares.<br><br>At Trafalgar Square, Extinction Rebellion placed hundreds of pairs of children&#x27;s shoes as they joined calls for an immediate ceasefire to protect citizens&#x27; lives. Meanwhile, in Scotland, dozens of protesters participated in a &#x27;die-in&#x27; in Glasgow.</p>
