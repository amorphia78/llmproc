        <h1>Just Stop Oil pair charged over West End protest</h1><p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil activists disrupted a West End production of The Tempest starring Sigourney Weaver by taking to the stage at Drury Lane theatre. Richard Weir, 60, and Hayley Walsh, 42, carried a sign reading &quot;over 1.5 degrees is a global shipwreck&quot; before being guided off stage after less than a minute. Both have been charged with aggravated trespass and will appear in court on 25 February.</p>
