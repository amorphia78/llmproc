    <p>PRIMARY: Five Just Stop Oil activists, including founder Roger Hallam (sentenced to 5 years) and four others (sentenced to 4 years each), were jailed for organizing protests that blocked the M25 motorway in November 2022. About 45 protesters climbed onto gantries over four successive days, causing 50,000 hours of vehicle delays and costing over Â£1.8m total.<br><br>SECONDARY: Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace UK will intervene to support the activists&#x27; appeal against their sentences, arguing they breach human rights legislation.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The groups criticized the sentences as disproportionate compared to those given for racially motivated violence, calling the anti-protest laws &quot;draconian&quot; and having a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on peaceful protest.<br><br>TONE: The article presents a neutral tone, reporting facts while giving substantial space to criticism of the sentences from environmental groups.</p>
