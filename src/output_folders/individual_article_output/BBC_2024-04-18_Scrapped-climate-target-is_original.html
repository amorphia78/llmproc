    <p>Scottish government plans to scrap a key climate change target are a &quot;global embarrassment&quot;, say environment campaigners.<br><br>Ministers are expected to confirm later that the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 75% by 2030 has been dropped.<br><br>BBC Scotland News understands the government&#x27;s annual climate targets could also be ditched, although the final aim of reaching net-zero by 2045 will remain.<br><br>Friends of the Earth Scotland branded it &quot;the worst environmental decision in the history of the Scottish Parliament&quot;.<br><br>The charity&#x27;s Connal Hughes said: &quot;The Scottish government has had 15 years to bring forward the transformative action that would mean warm homes, good public transport and good green jobs.<br><br>&quot;They haven&#x27;t delivered. Instead of ramping up action they&#x27;re scrapping targets and breaking promises.&quot;<br><br>He said it was &quot;very concerning&quot; that annual targets could be dropped as well.<br><br>Oxfam Scotland called for tax reforms to &quot;incentivise polluters to clean up their acts&quot;.<br><br>The charity&#x27;s Jamie Livingstone said: “With the world becoming a dirtier and deadlier place every day, any decision by Scottish ministers to re-write Scotland’s climate rulebook would be an acute global embarrassment.<br><br>&quot;It would also be the direct and damaging consequence of the Scottish government’s own dilly dallying on climate action.&quot;<br><br>Greenpeace said the Scottish government had failed to deliver policies to meet its climate promises<br><br>UK political campaigner, Ami McCarthy, said: “Legislating to reduce Scotland’s climate ambition, fresh off the back of the planet&#x27;s hottest ever recorded 12-month period, is like striking a match in a petrol station.<br><br>&quot;It might not set the whole thing ablaze immediately but it’s clearly a dangerous step to take.&quot;<br><br>Former first minister Nicola Sturgeon previously said that Scotland had the &quot;most stretching targets in the world&quot; for climate change.<br><br>In 2019 the Scottish Parliament passed legislation to speed up the rate of decarbonisation.<br><br>However, the most recent statistics showed that eight out of 12 annual targets had been missed.<br><br>Emissions for 2021 were 49.2% lower than the baseline year of 1990.<br><br>Former first minister Alex Salmond told BBC Radio&#x27;s Good Morning Scotland that the decision to &quot;stretch&quot; targets was a mistake, and that it was &quot;hugely embarrassing&quot; for First Minister Humza Yousaf.</p>

    <p>Scotland&#x27;s international development minister Kaukab Stewart told BBC Scotland&#x27;s Debate Night that she was &quot;very disappointed&quot; by the news.<br><br>She added: &quot; With the measures that we are taking locally here in Glasgow with active travel, investing in hydrogen buses, we are making progress on that. I am very disappointed.&quot;<br><br>Earlier this year the Climate Change Committee - which provides independent advice to ministers - said that the 2030 target was now unreachable.<br><br>The 75% target was 5% more than experts had recommended.<br><br>In 2019 the Scottish Greens had argued for the goal to be 80% and abstained from the Climate Change Bill vote.<br><br>Green MSP Ross Greer said it was &quot;a difficult day for the planet and Scotland&quot;.<br><br>He also argued that the Scottish Government&#x27;s targets had been made on the assumption of a cooperative UK Government.<br><br>Mr Greer told BBC Scotland news that previous governments had not taken enough climate action and his party had &quot;massively escalated&quot; climate action since joining government.<br><br>He said people could &quot;trust the Greens to make sure climate action is delivered in government&quot;.<br><br>Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar MSP, said the first minister had promised to &quot;meet and better&quot; Scotland’s climate targets.<br><br>But he added: “The fact is Humza Yousaf is rowing back on his climate targets while siding with oil and gas giants who are making record profits.&quot;<br><br>Douglas Lumsden, Scottish Conservative net zero spokesperson, said the decision was an &quot;abject humiliation&quot; for the government.<br><br>He added: “For all the boasting about their supposed environmental credentials, the reality is a succession of missed targets – and being forced to throw in the towel on this flagship pledge represents the biggest failure of the lot.&quot;<br><br>Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said it was a &quot;generational betrayal&quot; from the SNP and the Scottish Greens over climate change promises.<br><br>He said: “When it came to doing the actual hard graft of insulating homes, planting trees or cutting emissions, they have proven to be woefully incompetent.&quot;</p></body></html>
