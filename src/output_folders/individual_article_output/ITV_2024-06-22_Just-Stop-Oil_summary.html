        <h1>Just Stop Oil protesters refused bail after denying Stansted Airport jets paint attack</h1><p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil protesters, Jennifer Kowalski (28) and Cole Macdonald (22), used angle grinders to break through Stansted Airport&#x27;s fence at 5am and sprayed orange paint on two private jets using fire extinguishers. The action caused Â£52,000 in cleanup costs and disrupted 75 flights for 38 minutes, affecting thousands of passengers. Both denied charges of criminal damage and interfering with national infrastructure.</p>
