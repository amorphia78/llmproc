    <p>At least 2,456 fuel lobbyists have been given access to the COP28 summit in Dubai, a climate change coalition has claimed.<br><br>Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) called it an &quot;unprecedented presence&quot; and said representatives of some of the world&#x27;s biggest polluters were there.<br><br>It said fuel lobbyists were collectively the biggest delegation and received more passes than the 10 most vulnerable nations to climate change combined (1,609).<br><br>Many of the fossil fuel lobbyists are said to have gained access by being part of a trade organisation.<br><br>KBPO said the largest was the Geneva-based International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), who it said brought 116 people - including representatives from Shell, TotalEnergies and Norway&#x27;s Equinor.<br><br>France also brought &quot;fossil fuel giants&quot; EDF as part of its country delegation, said KBPO.<br><br>BP, ExxonMobil and ENI staff were also said to be among those in the European Union group.<br><br>Kick Big Polluters Out is a coalition of more than 450 international groups that support action on climate change.<br><br>It includes the likes of Greenpeace and ActionAid as well as many smaller local or regional organisations.<br><br>The coalition said it had analysed the provisional list of COP28 delegates &quot;line-by-line in the most in-depth study into the fossil fuel industry&#x27;s presence at any talks to date&quot;.<br><br>It said its estimate was probably conservative as it only counted people who openly declared their connection to fossil fuels.</p>

    <p>It&#x27;s also a big jump on its count from the last COP in Egypt (636) and the 503 it counted at Glasgow the year before.<br><br>Alexia Leclercq - from environmental education group Start:Empowerment - was one of several campaigners to speak out.<br><br>&quot;Big polluters&#x27; poisonous presence has bogged us down for years, keeping us from advancing the pathways needed to keep fossil fuels in the ground,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;They are the reason COP28 is clouded in a fog of climate denial, not climate reality.&quot;<br><br>Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player<br><br>It comes soon after the head of the summit caused controversy by saying there was &quot;no science&quot; to suggest phasing out fossil fuels would help limit global warming to 1.5C - a key global target.<br><br>Sultan al Jaber was recorded saying &quot;there is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says the phase-out of fossil fuel is what&#x27;s going to achieve 1.5C&quot;.<br><br>He added: &quot;A phase-out of fossil fuel, in my view, is inevitable, it is essential. But we need to be real, serious and pragmatic about it.&quot;<br><br>Critics have questioned his suitability as head of COP because he&#x27;s also the boss of state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.<br><br>He&#x27;s also faced allegations the UAE wanted to use the summit to strike new oil and gas deals - claims he denied.<br><br>The summit, which opened last week in Dubai, is scheduled to run until 12 December.</p></body></html>
