    <p>WAITERS in a Spanish holiday hotspot are being forced to live in tents  following a tourist property boom.<br><br>The stark increase in housing costs has seen shocking slum-like shanty towns pop up as some locals have no choice but to live in squalor.<br><br>Low-paid service workers who are crucial to the tourism industry are being pushed out of the market because of the boom in holiday rentals in Tenerife.<br><br>This, along with the rising cost of living crisis, is causing a huge homelessness issue on the island.<br><br>Some are residing in caravans or are having to put up makeshift homes made from wood or prefabricated structures.<br><br>José, a 65-year-old kitchen assistant who works in a hotel, told The Telegraph how he was forced out of his apartment last year.<br><br>He rented the property for £340 a month before the landlord turned it into a short-term rental for holidaymakers.<br><br>José said: “Now anything with one or two bedrooms costs at least €900. I earn minimum wage, €1,100.<br><br>&quot;If I have to pay that kind of rent, then we won’t be able to eat. Here we eat by cooking on gas.”<br><br>José Antonio Díez Dávila, coordinator of Mobile Street Outreach Units (UMAC) at Caritas Diocesana de Tenerife, told Canarian Weekly: &quot;We have been sounding the alarm for years about housing access problems and homelessness in Tenerife, especially in the south.&quot;<br><br>An analysis carried out by Caritas - a confederation of Catholic relief services - last year suggested that around 2,400 people across the island were living in shanties, substandard housing or other structures such as tents and campervans.<br><br>More than 770 homeless people were in 2023 based in the southern municipalities of Arona, Adeje and Grenadilla de Abona.<br><br>Many of those reduced to homelessness still have a job, but they can&#x27;t afford a home due to lack of living spaces, rent prices and mortgages.<br><br>It comes as thousands took to the streets of Tenerife to demand restrictions on holidaymakers after telling Brits to &quot;go home&quot;.<br><br>The anti-tourist hordes filled a square in the capital brandishing banners including some that read “You enjoy we suffer” in English.<br><br>More than 15,000 people waved Canary Islands’ flags and blew horns to make a deafening noise in capital Santa Cruz.<br><br>Protests also took place at the same time on other popular Canary islands including Lanzarote and Gran Canaria.<br><br>THERE have been many protests staged across Spain recently to try and combat mass tourism.<br><br>Tens of thousands of people are protesting across the Canary Islands to demand a freeze on the number of visitors allowed to visit the the Spanish archipelago.<br><br>So far demonstrations have taken place in Lanzarote, Gran Canaria, Santa Cruz.</p>

    <p>Protesters have called the tourism strategy into question and have argued that life has been made unaffordable and environmentally unsustainable for residents.<br><br>The protests are supported by environmental groups including Greenpeace, WWF, Ecologists in Action, Friends of the Earth and SEO/Birdlife.<br><br>Anti-tourist protestors want the authorities to paralyse two projects including one which involves the construction of a five-star hotel by one of Tenerife’s last virgin beaches.<br><br>They are also looking for more protection from mass tourism - to help with the local environment, traffic and housing issues.<br><br>Other demands include the protection of natural spaces, a tourist tax and better working conditions for hotel cleaners, who joined the protest in Santa Cruz as they insisted to local press: “We are not slaves.”<br><br>More demonstrations are scheduled for the Spanish mainland in cities like Malaga and Madrid as well as London and Berlin.<br><br>Protestor Xiomara Cruz, who took part in Gran Canaria, said: “They made us believe that in the Canary Islands we live from tourism and what we want is the right of islanders to live in their land.”<br><br>Paula Rincon told local press: “It pains me that Canarians cannot afford to live in their own neighbourhoods.”<br><br>Campaigners have tried to distance themselves from anti-tourist graffiti which has appeared on walls and benches in and around southern Tenerife.<br><br>Bitter messages plastered in tourism hotspots over recent months have read &quot;your paradise, our misery&quot; and told &quot;tourists go home&quot;.<br><br>Tenerife particularly has gone to bat against sun-seeking Brits who have even called hotels on the island out of fear they may not be safe on their holidays.<br><br>Residents of the sun-soaked destination have said they are &quot;fed-up&quot; of &quot;low quality&quot; Brit tourists who only come for the cheap beer, burgers and sunbathing.<br><br>But the Canary Islands president Fernando Clavijo expressed his concern over the growing anti-tourism movement and begged holidaymakers to keep coming.<br><br>Brits will now be hit with a new tourist tax in Tenerife following the protests.<br><br>This latest proposal - known as eco tax - is part of the island&#x27;s new tourism strategy being drafted by the government of Canary Islands.<br><br>The island&#x27;s council confirmed the new tax system will come in effect from January 1, 2025, as residents of Tenerife demand a cut on holidaymakers.<br><br>The tax will be applied to all the famous nature sites that are protected, including the volcano Mount Teide, hamlets like Masca and several rural parks.<br><br>Officials say the new charge will help to protect and control the island&#x27;s natural spaces.</p>
