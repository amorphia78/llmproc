    <p>Baffled, I sat with my group of friends around a ‘reserved’ table – covered in sparkly confetti, balloons and a Happy Birthday table banner down the middle – before it dawned on me that they had arranged a surprise 70th birthday dinner.<br><br>With a cake and candles in front of me, I looked at each beaming face and felt humbled. It was their way of saying thank you for treating them to this holiday in Tenerife.<br><br>I’m no flash sugar daddy but I didn’t have to scrimp and scrape for it, either.<br><br>So how could I afford – as a retired hospital chef – to be so generous? It all started in 2019 at the age of 65.<br><br>Walking down Peckham High Street one day, I heard someone call out: ‘Excuse me, sir!’ I ignored him but he ran in front of me with: ‘Have you ever thought of modelling?’<br><br>Seriously? At my age? He must be joking. I told him to p**s off! Usually it’s teenage girls, not pensioners like me, in market-bought jeans and a sensible anorak.<br><br>He gave me his card, then I gave him my email address and let him take my photo, thinking I’d be dining out on this story for years to come.<br><br>So six weeks later, when I got the message from him – I later learned he was called Quentin McQueen and he owned the model agency, Xdirectn – asking me to attend a photoshoot, I still thought it sounded dodgy.<br><br>I decided to go out of curiosity and turned up at the scruffy location in East London. I joined a winding queue of around 100 people.<br><br>They had asked males to wear slim-fitting black trousers and warned we’d be photographed bare-chested. After having the photos taken, they recorded my measurements.<br><br>It was an interesting day out when I had nothing better to do – but later, I got another email saying I’d passed the audition to join a modelling agency. I was flabbergasted. I didn’t know I’d even been at an audition.<br><br>Four months later on 26 July 2019, I landed my first modelling job – thanks to Quentin – which was amazingly the same date in 1971 that I’d started work for the NHS as a hospital chef before retiring in 2011 at the age of 55.<br><br>This first gig was for a high-end fashion magazine called Buffalo Zine. The clothes I wore were ridiculously expensive, but spectacular. They included a Louis Vuitton leather jacket and a £8,500 woven rubber coat.<br><br>I was also the oldest person there. The photographer got me to relax by asking me lots of mundane questions – such as ‘How did you travel here today?’, ‘What sort of music do you listen to’ – which he suggested I answer in the character of my favourite method actor, Rod Steiger.<br><br>This money has helped me take my 40 Godchildren on holidays and day trips, rather than just handing over Christmas and birthday presents<br><br>I think photographers choose me because I follow their directions to the tee. I do exactly what they tell me to do and I never moan. I simply have fun and do as I am told, even when it’s to stand in flip-flops, underwear and a towel, outdoors in freezing January!<br><br>Since then, I’ve done nudity just once, for a book about the pandemic. There was nothing salacious about it – it was more of an art project.<br><br>I exercise and stretch every day to keep trim, not just for modelling but for my health, too.<br><br>My best-paid job was for the designer, Vivienne Westwood. I received £1,000 each time and I’ve done two jobs for her.<br><br>The first was a showcase for her Autumn/Winter collection 2020, held at the Serpentine Gallery. We had to pose on tables and chairs while celebrity guests drank champagne and ate canapes.<br><br>There were a lot of celebs there, including Bianca Jagger and Vivienne herself. She was very pleasant and down to earth and displayed no airs and graces.<br><br>Unfortunately, by the time I did the second shoot for her sunglasses range, she had recently passed.<br><br>I used that cash to treat my friends to the Tenerife holiday where we celebrated my 70th. I also paid for a trip to Menorca in August with three of my godchildren – Karen and her 13-year-old daughter, Roushanna, plus Charles, who’s 43.<br><br>My other modelling jobs have included working with Clarks Shoes, Sicky Mag, Brixton Brewery (promotion for Generation Pale Ale, which was sold to raise funds for Lambeth Age UK), Central Saint Martins’ runway show for student designer Ross Palmer and a Baracuta Harrington Jacket promo. I have also been in videos for Little Runaway by Celeste and Deluded by Silas Armstrong.</p>

    <p>This money has helped me take my 40 Godchildren on holidays and day trips, rather than just handing over Christmas and birthday presents.<br><br>I first became a Godfather just after my 16th birthday. A few of my Godchildren chose me because I go to church regularly and they got baptised as adults. Very often they then asked me to be the Godfather for their children, so l am the Godfather for the entire family.<br><br>I love my Godchildren, and I love being able to treat them all – but I never spoil them.<br><br>One Godson asked for a £600 laptop to help with homework, but I told him a £200-300 version would do the job. Another asked for Nike trainers. ‘As long as you can get them for under £50 from TK Maxx, it’s fine by me,’ I told him.<br><br>Despite my new income, I like to think that I’ve stayed humble. I have lived in the same one-bedroom flat in Brixton since 1976 and I’ve never been one to splash the cash on designer clothes or anything else. My favourite place to eat out is a greasy spoon in Woolwich.<br><br>I’m single and I don’t have lavish tastes. So what else am I going to do with the money but make precious memories with those closest to me?<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
