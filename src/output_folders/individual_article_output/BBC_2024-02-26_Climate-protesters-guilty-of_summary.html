    <p>PRIMARY: Three Just Stop Oil protesters - Deborah Wilde (69), Simon Milner-Edwards (67), and William Ward (66) - were found guilty of aggravated trespass after storming Wimbledon tennis courts and throwing confetti and puzzle pieces during matches in July. They scaled barriers and disrupted play on Court 18, causing players to appear frustrated and intimidated. The protesters waited for breaks in play but were found to have intentionally caused disruption.</p>

    <p><br><br>SECONDARY: No secondary protest actions mentioned.<br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The court ruled protesters could not use climate change threats as a legal defense. Wimbledon spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on protest management that year following Just Stop Oil demonstrations at other sporting events.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral, factual tone focused on legal proceedings and court findings.</p></body></html>
