    <p>Team Starmer are offering limited-edition t-shirts with the slogan &#x27;Sparkle with Starmer&#x27; after a protester showered the Labour leader with glitter during the party&#x27;s conference in Liverpool yesterday.<br><br>Supporters can unleash their &#x27;inner shimmer&#x27; by wearing the white t-shirt that features a &#x27;sparkle design&#x27;, which can be pre-ordered from the Labour Party&#x27;s gift shop for £20.<br><br>A description on the online gift shop for the t-shirt says: &#x27;Unleash your inner shimmer and shine with our brand new, exclusive, &quot;Sparkle with Starmer&quot; t-shirt!&#x27;<br><br>On Tuesday afternoon, before Sir Keir could start his speech setting out how he would run the country, Yaz Ashmawi, 28, poured glitter over the Labour leader while yelling &#x27;democracy is in crisis&#x27;.<br><br>In the shocking security breach in Liverpool yesterday afternoon, Mr Ashmawi managed to reach the stage unchallenged, and get his arms around the opposition leader in a grip for several seconds before bodyguards tackled him and dragged the disrupter away.<br><br>The protester, who has links to eco-groups Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, was arrested on suspicion of assault, breach of the peace and causing public nuisance.<br><br>The Labour leader looked bemused and tried to keep Ashmawi at arm&#x27;s length until security tackled the protester and led him off stage.<br><br>Sir Keir then brushed off the glitter, and told a cheering conference: &#x27;If he thinks that bothers me he doesn&#x27;t know me.&#x27;<br><br>The Labour leader used the speech to claim the &#x27;tide is turning&#x27; for Labour today as he gave potentially his last conference speech before an election.<br><br>He insisted he is the leader to &#x27;heal&#x27; the country - but warned it will require a &#x27;decade of national renewal&#x27;. Sir Keir said he had turned Labour into a &#x27;party of service&#x27;, &#x27;renewed&#x27; after the Corbyn era.</p>

    <p>Sir Keir praised the spirit of the British people despite the &#x27;Tory project to kick the hope out of this country&#x27;.<br><br>Promising to reshape the country with 1.5 million homes including new towns, modernised infrastructure and support for green industries, Sir Keir said &#x27;the fire of change still burns in Britain&#x27; and it &#x27;lives on in Labour&#x27;.<br><br>With a general election next year and Labour enjoying double-digit poll leads, Sir Keir warned that the &#x27;dangerous&#x27; Tories would &#x27;scorch the earth just to get at us&#x27;.<br><br>And if he did win the keys to No 10, the scale of the challenge would be immense compared with his predecessors.<br><br>&#x27;If you think our job in 1997 was to rebuild a crumbling public realm, that in 1964 it was to modernise an economy left behind by the pace of technology, in 1945 to build a new Britain out of the trauma of collective sacrifice, then in 2024 it will have to be all three.&#x27;<br><br>Sir Keir put reforming the &#x27;restrictive planning system&#x27; at the core of his plan to secure economic growth.<br><br>The system was &#x27;a blockage that stops this country building roads, grid connections, laboratories, trainlines, warehouses, windfarms, power stations&#x27; and &#x27;an obstacle to the aspirations of millions&#x27;.<br><br>The plan to &#x27;get Britain building again&#x27; would &#x27;fight the blockers who hold a veto over British aspiration&#x27;.<br><br>The 1.5 million homes promised by would involve new development corporations with powers to cut through red tape and the creation of the &#x27;next generation of Labour new towns&#x27;.<br><br>He insisted his plans would not mean &#x27;tearing up the green belt&#x27; but building could take place in areas where that protection was &#x27;clearly ridiculous&#x27;.</p>
