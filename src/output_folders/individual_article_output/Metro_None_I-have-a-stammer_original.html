    <p>My heart is racing, my palms are sweaty and I repeat the letter ‘J’ in my head over and over again.<br><br>‘Hi, my name is Jonathan,’ I tell the person I’m meeting.<br><br>A huge wave of relief crashes over me. I’ve done it. I’ve managed to maintain my covert-stammerer status once more.<br><br>After developing the speech impediment as a child, I have faced bullying, mental health battles and even thoughts of suicide.<br><br>And even now, at the age of 40, I work impossibly hard every day –  in every conversation – to hide my stammer.<br><br>It all started when I was six, following the trauma of being sexually assaulted by a man of 18 who abused a position of trust to carry out his crime. He was charged and sentenced to four years in jail.<br><br>My stammer developed within months of that incident, and I didn’t make the connection between the two until a therapy session years later.<br><br>I was self conscious about my speech, but my friends made sure it was never a big deal.<br><br>That was, until my family decided to move from Wales to East London when I was 14 because of my dad’s work.<br><br>Almost instantaneously, the other kids in my class took a dislike to me, a small, stammering bag of bones with a distinctive accent.  Verbal teasing quickly became physical violence – with every day a perpetual cycle of bullying, with someone once even pulling a knife on me.<br><br>While I didn’t talk about it – my parents knew something was up, so I was sent back to my old school in Wales and lived with my grandparents to complete my GCSEs.<br><br>But the bullies had destroyed my self-esteem and self-worth – and, ironically, they had only made my stammer worse.<br><br>Filled with self-loathing, I dropped out of school at the age of 16 and did nothing for three years.<br><br>At 19, I started studying bookkeeping at college and started working on my stammer, which was still wreaking havoc on my mental health.<br><br>I began focusing on losing my accent to try and improve my speech – forcing myself to parrot the East London pronunciations I had heard when I lived there.<br><br>The biggest breakthrough was saying my name: Jonathan – hearing it aloud gave me hope that I might be able to have conversations.<br><br>At college, meeting new people was terrifying – I would panic and find that getting words out was like hitting a brick wall or running up a hill.<br><br>The more I tried to force it the more I would contort my face and lips to get a word out and it would be a physical effort.<br><br>But over the years, I became better at hiding it, and would only use words that I was able to say without stammering.<br><br>That meant I would suddenly change the conversation because of the words I could say – in turn, people would think I was strange, rude or disinterested.<br><br>But I still managed to get a job, despite my fear of interviews for obvious reasons, and started a career while still struggling to get on top of those feelings of fear and self-loathing.<br><br>Even when I met my wife Jess in 2013, through work, I hid my stammer from her because I didn’t want to seem weak – it was only after a decade together that she found out, when my feelings led me to a suicide attempt last year.<br><br>Battling myself every day was such hard work mentally, emotionally, and physically.<br><br>Every time I slipped up, or found myself stammering over a word, I’d beat myself up internally and dwell on it for days.<br><br>The more I did it, the more embarrassed I got and the more I stammered – it was a vicious cycle and extremely draining. Some days I was so exhausted I just didn’t want to speak.<br><br>Over the next 10 years, even as my life, love and career looked outwardly good, depression meant I felt like I was in a dark pit.</p>

    <p>Jess didn’t know about my mental health problems, because I hadn’t truly recognised them myself.<br><br>But then in July last year, I reached a tipping point. I stumbled over an innocuous word in a standard work meeting, and the floodgates opened – I was overwhelmed by past trauma and the years of torturing myself.<br><br>Intrusive thoughts told me I had let my family down, didn’t deserve my job or my life, and that I wasn’t good enough.<br><br>It all brought up long-suppressed feelings around my assault, and it became so painful I devised a plan to end it all.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
