    <p>Let me set the scene.<br><br>I’m sitting on top of his kitchen worktop, my legs wrapped around his waist, as he runs his fingers through my hair.<br><br>After weeks of sending naughty emails to each other, we’re both excited to finally be alone, about to do all the things we’ve talked about.<br><br>Damien* kissed my neck before letting his mouth wander further across my body and we eventually ended up in the bedroom.<br><br>I wake up the next day with a smile on my face – the sex was just as good as I’d been promised; as satisfying as this self-assured, cocky, man had sworn it would be in our steamy chat.<br><br>You might expect me to say that Damien’s bedroom performance was down to his penis, that he was so confident because he was large and in charge, that he put the big dick in ‘big dick energy.’<br><br>But, no.<br><br>His penis was in fact on the smaller side, just below average. And he was still one of my best sexual experiences ever.<br><br>Here’s the part where I tell you that size doesn’t matter – that it’s about the motion of the ocean or how to use what you’ve got, and all those other clichés.<br><br>Except size does matter, just not in the way you might think.<br><br>Stick with me, I promise there’s a good reason for why I’m saying this.<br><br>Damien was the kind of man who knew how to command a room.<br><br>Everyone liked him and he made me laugh all the time. That’s what first drew me to him.<br><br>When we had sex, I wasn’t bothered about his penis being smaller.<br><br>Because neither Damien’s looks nor his dick size had anything to do with why the sex was so good.<br><br>It was his confidence in himself that sparked our intense connection.<br><br>He knew he had a smaller appendage and it didn’t affect his performance. That level of self-awareness and cockiness was hot.<br><br>Frankly, he didn’t give a s**t. He shouldn’t have. And neither should you.<br><br>You might wonder why I – a woman – am discussing men’s penises. Firstly, as a sex writer, every aspect of shagging, including how people feel about their bodies, interests me. It’s only by talking about awkward topics that we lift the stigma that surrounds them.<br><br>But the truth is that I was also recently accused of size-shaming in quite a horrible email in response to one of my previous articles.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times. Then, one day, he opened his front door and started walking. He didn&#x27;t stop for three years, by which time he&#x27;d walked the coast of the UK and improved his mental health.<br><br>Writer Azania Patel shares her worst date series for our So, How Did it Go? series. She fancied her date - until he admitted to being a Just Stop Oil protester.<br><br>Labour MP Dawn Butler shines a light on the small change the Conservatives have made recently that could help them steal the election. She reckons you didn&#x27;t even notice.<br><br>And finally, mum-of-two Kellie Whitehead recalls the time she took &#x27;snus&#x27; with her 17-year-old son. She says she was overwhelmed by the strength of the nicotine pouch and now has a warning for parents.<br><br>So I want to set the record straight: I truly believe every penis – whether micro or mega – is beautiful in its own way.<br><br>Moreover, I am writing about this today because I want fellow women to understand that how we react to and talk about a man’s jewels can impact his self-confidence.<br><br>And I want men to feel reassured and seen.<br><br>I am never OK with body shaming. And while I tackle all sorts of topics from an expert perspective, I highly recommend you choose your words carefully when talking to your own sexual partners.</p>

    <p>Because it’s not just men on the smaller side who worry – men with larger penises tell me they have concerns, too.<br><br>I used to date a man with a huge one, both long and girthy.<br><br>When he unzipped his jeans, I was a bit stunned because I was concerned that I might feel more than a little sore afterwards – a prediction that proved accurate, even if the sex was good.<br><br>Afterwards, my lover told me that he often had to ‘hold back’ in certain sex positions, like doggy, because previous partners said it was too much.<br><br>Other men with large erections explain that they have issues when receiving oral sex or want to try anal sex, but are concerned about how it will go. Or struggle to stay hard because of the amount of blood that has to pump into their dick.<br><br>Men with smaller or thinner penises have shared additional concerns, like being afraid they aren’t giving their partner enough pleasure.<br><br>I don’t have a dick so I have no idea what it feels like to worry about any of the above.<br><br>But I imagine it’s similar to how women feel about uneven and saggy breasts, or the appearance of our vaginal lips.<br><br>And it’s understandable – it can be nerve-wracking to expose yourself to someone else and we all want reassurance from our lovers.<br><br>That’s what I mean when I say that dick size matters.<br><br>Because if something matters to you, it should matter to your sexual partner.<br><br>And being open about the things that bother you can improve your experience in the bedroom.<br><br>As an example, a man I used to date had a particular curve to his penis that sometimes caused it to slip out.<br><br>It was no-one’s fault, but it often interrupted our love-making. Rather than letting the issue go unspoken, we worked together to find a solution.<br><br>We popped a pillow under my bum and voilà, problem solved.<br><br>Those conversations don’t need to be deadly serious either – some men I know like to joke about their penis size or sexual performance.<br><br>‘I know my dick is average but you love it,’ an ex quipped, and he was right.<br><br>His member was technically just about the ‘average’ UK size (which is somewhere around 5.1 inches when erect) but the sex was still great.<br><br>Talking about it took the pressure off. He seemed more at ease.<br><br>It was great that he felt so comfortable around it and made me fancy him even more.<br><br>However, I also made it clear how much I enjoyed our sex life and if you’re ever in a similar scenario, I recommend you do the same.<br><br>A word of warning though: never make wisecracks or say negative things about someone else’s body – let them introduce this level of humour, if they want to.<br><br>Always remember, sex isn’t about what we look like. It’s about how we respond to each other’s bodies. Every part of them.<br><br>To all the wonderful men out there: you and your glorious dick deserve love, respect and great sex, regardless of girth, length or curve.<br><br>Sod anyone who says otherwise, because you should be proud of your penis.<br><br>Take it from me, you’ll look all the more sexy if you do.<br><br>Do you have a story you’d like to share?
