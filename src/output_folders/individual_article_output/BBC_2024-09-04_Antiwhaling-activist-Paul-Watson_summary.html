        <h1>Anti-whaling activist Paul Watson kept in Greenland jail</h1><p>PRIMARY: Anti-whaling activist Paul Watson was arrested in Greenland in July on a 2012 Japanese warrant accusing him of damaging a Japanese whaling ship, obstructing business, and injuring a crew member during a 2010 encounter in Antarctic waters. The 73-year-old Canadian-American, former head of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, was aboard his vessel with 26 volunteers heading to intercept a Japanese whaling ship when arrested. A court ruled he must remain in custody pending extradition decision.</p>
