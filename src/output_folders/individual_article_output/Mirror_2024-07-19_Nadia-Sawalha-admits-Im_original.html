    <p>Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha admitted: &quot;I&#x27;m not very good at this!&quot; as she was forced to step in as host of the ITV daytime show.<br><br>In the absence of its usual anchors like Charlene White and Jane Moore, Nadia was forced to step up from her usual position as a regular panellist, making sure segments moved on in the right timeframe.<br><br>She also had to tell viewers what&#x27;s coming up – something she clearly found difficult as she rifled through papers on her desk, admitting: &quot;I never know where my cards are!&quot;<br><br>The panel were discussing the Just Stop Oil protestors being jailed for five years, with Nadia admitting: &quot;When I saw that sentence today, do you know what, I was actually furious.<br><br>&quot;When you think we have sentences for people found with child pornography, sexual assault, that get sentences way below that. The maximum you can get at the moment – wait for this, girls, you might be really surprised – for stalking...&quot;<br><br>But then she began tossing papers around – clearly unable to find the information she was after.<br><br>Viewers were left feeling sympathetic on social media, with one X user penning: &quot;Nadia is such a chaotic #LooseWomen anchor and I&#x27;m here for it. She should do it more often.&quot; Someone else was more critical, fuming: &quot;Nadia is sh** at being anchor.&quot;</p>

    <p>Another fan disagreed with her: &quot;Nadia is wrong Just Stop Oil are not saving the planet. They are a bunch of selfish idiots!&quot;<br><br>It comes after Nadia joined a topless protest in Westminster alongside 31 other women in June to demand the approval of “life-extending” cancer drug Enhertu.<br><br>Nadia represented one of the 31 lives lost to secondary breast cancer every day in the UK, stripping topless and covering her boobs in bright pink body paint to support her friend Hannah Gardner, who has incurable breast cancer. Nadia told The Mirror: “Our message to the decision-makers is: ‘You have the power. Let’s see it. Show us you care because this could be your mother, your sister, your daughter.’”<br><br>She added: “For many of these women, it will be too late now, but what about the generations to come? We need to ensure that the next time a breakthrough drug for breast cancer emerges, there is a memory of what happens when you mess with women. We’ve seen women in bras before, but nothing like this. Nobody wants to get their t*ts out, but we need to be seen and heard.”</p>
