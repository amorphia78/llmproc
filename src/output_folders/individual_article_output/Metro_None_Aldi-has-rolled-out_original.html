    <p>Snack lovers will soon spot a big change that’s been launched at Aldi.<br><br>The budget retailer has changed the packaging for its own-label crisp packets – and it’s happening for a very good reason.<br><br>The UK’s cheapest supermarket will instead make the packaging out of recycled plastic in a bid to reduce waste and encourage customers to recycle.<br><br>The crisp packets will use a minimum of 35% recycled material across its Specially Selected Hand Cooked range which has a legion of hungry fans.<br><br>One customer, Stuart MacRae, previously declared the Lightly Salted variety ‘the best crisps available to humanity’ in a tweet on X. And another fan known only as Andy agreed, saying ‘they are the nicest crisps I’ve ever eaten’.<br><br>Don’t worry though, the change only affects the packaging – not the deliciousness inside.<br><br>The change to the crisp packets has already rolled out nationwide and the supermarket says it expects to cut 78 tones of unused plastic as a result.<br><br>Aldi is planning to use the new recycled packaging on its own-label popcorn and lentil chips by the end of 2024, too.<br><br>‘At Aldi, we are continuously making changes when it comes to reducing plastic waste, and we know how important this is to our customers too,’ said Luke Emery, plastics and packaging director at Aldi.<br><br>‘Increasing the recycled content in our crisp packaging is just one way we are helping our customers to reduce their environmental impact, with all these little changes adding up to make an even bigger difference.’<br><br>This is the latest change in Aldi’s mission to become more environmentally friendly. The supermarket also introduced plastic-free packaging for the toothbrushes it produces under the Dentitex Soft and Whitening brand name.</p>

    <p>It’s not just Aldi making huge changes either. Because of a new law, a crack down on plastic bottles has happened across major global drinks brands.<br><br>In an effort to reduce plastic waste, caps are now attached to the bottle by two small pieces of plastic, meaning it can’t be fully removed. People criticised the change on social media by labelling it ‘woke’ but it’s been in the works since 2018 when the EU confirmed the change to improve recycling and reduce plastic waste.<br><br>Something we’re all guilty of doing is losing our caps but this innocent mistake means lots of single-use plastic is abandoned somewhere, unable to decompose.<br><br>Companies selling drinks in the EU are expected to fully abide by the changes as of July 3, 2024.<br><br>One thing we do know is that our lunch boxes will be a lot greener.<br><br>Do you have a story to share?<br><br>Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer need to start saying the B word<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: Oil well just outside London ‘should never have been given permission to expand’<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: Stonehenge damaged after being covered in orange spray paint by Just Stop Oil<br><br>What’s on in London.
