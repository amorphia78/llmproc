        <h1>Heathrow Airport's expansion plans to cost £49bn</h1><p>Heathrow Airport has revealed details of its plan to expand and modernise the airport at a cost of £49bn.<br><br>Thomas Woldbye, CEO of Heathrow Airport, said expansion was &quot;urgent&quot; as the airport was currently working at capacity, &quot;to the detriment of trade and connectivity&quot;. The work would be funded by private finance.<br><br>The government has backed plans for a third runway, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves saying it would &quot;make Britain the world&#x27;s best connected place to do business&quot;.<br><br>However, the plans face opposition from environmental groups, politicians, and locals. London&#x27;s mayor Sir Sadiq Khan said it would have a &quot;severe impact on noise, air pollution and meeting our climate change targets&quot;.<br><br>The plans come a day after the deadline set by the government for parties to submit proposals.<br><br>Heathrow&#x27;s plans, which it estimates would be completed within a decade, include:<br><br>Heathrow said it would cost £21bn to build the third runway, which includes procuring the land, changing the M25 and other associated infrastructure costs while building the new terminal would be £12bn and modernising the current airport&#x27;s infrastructure £15bn. Due to rounding, it will total £49bn.<br><br>A spokesperson added the plans would grow the UK economy by 0.43% GDP.<br><br>The plans revealed by Heathrow were welcomed by business groups and airline companies.<br><br>A joint statement from the Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, MakeUK, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors, said it was &quot;an investment in the nation&#x27;s future&quot;.<br><br>It added: &quot;The benefits are clear: for exporters, it opens up vital access to major and emerging markets; for visitors, it enhances global and domestic connectivity; and for businesses, it unlocks billions in private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs, and driving skills across the country.&quot;<br><br>John Dickie, chief executive of BusinessLDN, said as the airport was currently operating at full capacity, the expansion would give businesses &quot;better connectivity to overseas markets and support Britain&#x27;s growth&quot;.<br><br>He added it would also help achieve the government&#x27;s target of 50 million international visitors per year to the UK.<br><br>Mr Woldbye said Heathrow&#x27;s submission was in line with the aviation industry&#x27;s target to be net zero by 2050.<br><br>He added that Heathrow was &quot;the airport in the world with the highest uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuel&quot;, and that planning permission would not be granted by government unless legal limits of emissions were adhered to.<br><br>However, the plans were heavily criticised by groups who called the environmental justifications for the plans as &quot;hopeful marketing spin&quot;.<br><br>Dr Douglas Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said the government had &quot;decided yet again to prioritise more leisure opportunities for a comparatively small group of frequent fliers, whilst the rest of us have to live with the consequences of their disproportionate polluting&quot;.<br><br>He suggested a &quot;frequent flier levy&quot;, and said no expansion should take place until there was a solution to the &quot;pollution problem&quot;.<br><br>His concerns were echoed by politicians including Sir Sadiq who said he remained &quot;unconvinced&quot; that hundreds of thousands of additional flights each year would not have a &quot;hugely detrimental&quot; impact.<br><br>He added City Hall would &quot;carefully scrutinise&quot; the impact the extension would have on people living in the area and the &quot;huge knock-on effects for our transport infrastructure, which would require a comprehensive and costed plan to manage&quot;.<br><br>Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the applications that have come in &quot;will include investment in the infrastructure, for example, the changes around the M25 to make airport expansion necessary&quot;.<br><br>She added: &quot;Airport expansion is essential if we&#x27;re going to seize the opportunities, and this government are absolutely determined to seize the opportunities that come from being an open trading economy.&quot;<br><br>Asked about the mayor of London&#x27;s objections, Reeves said: &quot;These are decisions the national government make, and this Labour government backs Heathrow expansion, backs the third runway at Heathrow.&quot;</p><p>Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat MP for Twickenham, said Heathrow is already the single largest polluter in the UK.<br><br>She added: &quot;The Climate Change Committee itself has said expansion would put the UK&#x27;s climate goals at risk.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s also clear we can&#x27;t rely on the silver bullet of Sustainable Aviation Fuels to save the day.&quot;<br><br>Green Party deputy leader, Zack Polankski, said the plans were being delivered &quot;regardless&quot; of the environmental impact.<br><br>&quot;If Labour&#x27;s environmental commitments were worth the paper they&#x27;re written on, these proposals would never have seen the light of day,&quot; he said.<br><br>Local residents living in Harmondsworth, near the airport, told the BBC earlier this year a third of the village would be destroyed if a third runway was to go ahead.<br><br>Heathrow&#x27;s plans follow the publication of a rival proposal by the Arora Group, which has outlined a way to expand the airport without needing to redirect the M25.<br><br>Owner of the group, hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, said the creation of a third runway and a new terminal, under his plans, had a cost estimate of under £25bn, not including the redevelopment of the airport&#x27;s existing central area.<br><br>The proposal crucially does not involve an expensive alteration to the M25, as the group said it was possible to build a 2,800-metre (9,200 ft) third runway instead of the full-length 3,500-metre (11,500 ft) runway planned by the airport.<br><br>Arora Group said its plan, called Heathrow West, could have a new runway fully operational by 2035, while a new terminal would open in two phases, in 2036 and 2040.<br><br>When asked about the added expense of altering the M25 to accommodate a new, third runway, Heathrow&#x27;s CEO said: &quot;The whole conversation about the M25 has been slightly exaggerated&quot;, and that disruption to drivers would be minimal.<br><br>&quot;We will build a new and much better M25, 100m (330 ft) to the west of the current one. It will be wider and it will be safer and it will have more capacity,&quot; Mr Woldbye added.<br><br>He said plans to create a much shorter runway to avoid moving the M25 - like the one proposed by The Aurora Group - would &quot;not provide the capacity that we and the airlines need&quot;, but said the airport would be open to a discussion with airlines about building a shorter runway if it could deliver the same benefits.<br><br>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the two proposals were a &quot;significant step towards unlocking growth, creating jobs, and delivering vital national infrastructure&quot;.<br><br>&quot;We&#x27;ll consider the proposals carefully over the summer so that we can begin a review of the Airports National Policy Statement later this year,&quot; she added.<br><br>The London Borough of Hillingdon, which contains the whole of Heathrow, reiterated its opposition to expansion, calling the airport&#x27;s plan &quot;a glossy pitch&quot;.<br><br>It said Heathrow&#x27;s claims of full private funding &quot;don&#x27;t stand up to scrutiny - the public would ultimately bear the cost of tunnelling the M25, surface access works, and noise mitigation&quot;.<br><br>BBC London&#x27;s political editor Karl Mercer said: &quot;History has not been kind to plans to build a third runway, whoever has put them forward, and whichever colour government is in power.<br><br>&quot;Gordon Brown&#x27;s Labour government supported Heathrow expansion in 2009 - that didn&#x27;t happen.<br><br>&quot;Then during Conservative Theresa May&#x27;s reign in 2018, MPs voted overwhelmingly in support of a third runway - only for a series of court challenges and then Covid to put an end to those plans.<br><br>&quot;There are plenty of Labour MPs in the capital who are still strongly opposed to expansion  - 28 voted against it last time and most are still in the House.<br><br>&quot;Having bidders interested is only half the battle - the hardest half will be getting it delivered.&quot;<br><br>Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.
