    <p>PRIMARY: Three Just Stop Oil protesters threw soup over two Van Gogh paintings at London&#x27;s National Gallery today, targeting works in the &#x27;Poets and Lovers&#x27; exhibition. This occurred hours after fellow activists Phoebe Plummer (23) and Anna Holland (22) were sentenced to prison for a similar 2022 stunt where they threw Heinz tomato soup over Van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers, causing £10,000 damage to the frame.<br><br>SECONDARY: Plummer received additional charges for involvement in a slow march causing travel chaos in west London and for spraying paint on Heathrow Airport departure boards.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The judge emphasized the cultural value of the artworks and rejected claims of political persecution, stating the protesters &quot;came within the width of a pane of glass of destroying one of the most valuable artworks in the world.&quot;<br><br>TONE: The article is strongly negative toward the protests, using terms like &quot;eco-idiots,&quot; &quot;vandals,&quot; and &quot;stupidity.&quot;</p>
