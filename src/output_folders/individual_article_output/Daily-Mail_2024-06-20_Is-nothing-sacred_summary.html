    <p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil activists sprayed orange powder paint on at least three ancient stones at Stonehenge using fire extinguishers before sitting cross-legged. The protesters were Rajan Naidu (73, from Birmingham, understood to be a Quaker) and Niamh Lynch (21, Oxford student). They demanded ending the fossil-fuel era, with Lynch stating climate policy shouldn&#x27;t stand &quot;inert for generations&quot; like stones.<br><br>SECONDARY: The article mentions JSO&#x27;s previous &quot;extremist road-blocking tactics&quot; but doesn&#x27;t detail specific secondary actions.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article focuses heavily on political fallout, particularly Rishi Sunak challenging Labour donor Dale Vince who previously funded JSO, and accusations that Labour&#x27;s energy policy was influenced by the group&#x27;s tactics.<br><br>TONE: The article is strongly negative toward the protest, using terms like &quot;eco-fanatics,&quot; &quot;vandalism,&quot; &quot;extremist,&quot; and &quot;pathetic&quot; throughout.</p>
