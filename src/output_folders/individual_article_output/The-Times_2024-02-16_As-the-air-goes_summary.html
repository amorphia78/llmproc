    <p>PRIMARY: The Tyre Extinguishers deflated tyres on over 40 SUVs and sports cars in southwest London using items like sunflower seeds and pasta shards stuffed into valve caps. CCTV showed three men in baseball caps conducting the operation, taking under a minute per car. The decentralised group aims to make it &quot;impossible&quot; for city dwellers to drive &quot;polluting death machines.&quot;<br><br>SECONDARY: Just Stop Oil is launching a new campaign to lobby Labour candidates to pledge resignation if a Labour government signs new oil and gas contracts, representing a shift toward electoral politics.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: Roger Hallam and other climate movement leaders are moving away from disruptive tactics toward building local assemblies and preparing for societal collapse, with experts suggesting the movement needs broader public support rather than polarising approaches.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral tone, presenting both the protesters&#x27; motivations and the negative impact on affected residents like Jess Knowles.</p>
