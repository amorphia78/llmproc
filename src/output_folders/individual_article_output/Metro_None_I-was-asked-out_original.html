    <p>‘Are you OK?’ Asked the attractive stranger at the next table, clearly concerned at just how bad my date was going.<br><br>I was sitting in a pub and the man I’d come with had just left to go to the bathroom.<br><br>It was our first date; we matched on Tinder but I was shocked by just how different someone can be when you meet them in real life.<br><br>When exchanging messages, this person (let’s call him Oliver) seemed funny, self-assured and a little cocky.<br><br>I like confidence so I consider the last one a good trait… in moderation.<br><br>However, he turned out to be more interested in bragging about the money he made as an investment banker and talking about rowdy nights out with ‘the boys’, than asking me any questions about my life.<br><br>I also found it ironic how, given his obsession with his hefty bank account, Oliver didn’t offer to cover our round of drinks. I like to pay for myself anyway, but that’s besides the point here.<br><br>Nevertheless, I persevered and sat through the many ‘lads, lads, lads’ tales.<br><br>This I could just about stomach, but when he started making bizarre comments about women, saying that we need to be intelligent and funny enough to keep his interest, I mentally checked out.<br><br>Love reading juicy stories like this?

Which is where the aforementioned stranger – let’s call him Nick – came into the picture.<br><br>He was at the pub with a friend – who was also worried about how things are going for me – and they both implored me to ditch my date (who was still in the bathroom) and join them for drinks.<br><br>I found it sweet and somewhat hilarious that my evening was so visibly horrible to other people, so I was definitely tempted.<br><br>Considering my options, I thanked the pair for the offer but told them I would feel rude leaving a date.<br><br>‘OK but at least let me take you out sometime to make up for this horrible night?,’ Nick then said, while holding up his phone for me to type in my number.<br><br>I was gobsmacked. I had just minutes, possibly seconds, to make a decision before Oliver returned to the table. I had to act fast.<br><br>I decided to be bold, quickly typing my digits in and that was that. I organised a date, while on a date.<br><br>Once Oliver returned, I suggested we swap venues because, while I have no obligation to the man, it doesn’t feel quite right to stay in a pub where I’ve potentially just met someone else.<br><br>I should have listened to my instincts and ended the date then and there, but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. I was also in my early 20s at the time and didn’t feel comfortable excusing myself. I felt intimidated and didn’t want to upset my date.<br><br>These days, I am more confident and will speak up if things aren’t going well.<br><br>The evening did not improve.<br><br>Oliver and I had another few drinks, which was followed by a strange argument. I can’t recall the specifics, but I remember how I felt – belittled, angry and not in the mood to see this man ever again.<br><br>We didn’t have a second date.<br><br>It didn’t matter though as, the next day, Nick messaged me and we met up not long after (though thankfully in a different pub).<br><br>This time around, I was very excited, casually imagining what a great romantic movie plot this would make.<br><br>Unfortunately, this experience didn’t go much better.<br><br>The date itself was great fun; we laughed a lot, drank too much and eventually ended up in bed together at his flat.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.

She fancied her date - until he admitted to being a Just Stop Oil protester.<br><br>Labour MP Dawn Butler shines a light on the small change the Conservatives have made recently that could help them steal the election. She reckons you didn&#x27;t even notice.<br><br>And finally, mum-of-two Kellie Whitehead recalls the time she took &#x27;snus&#x27; with her 17-year-old son. She says she was overwhelmed by the strength of the nicotine pouch and now has a warning for parents.<br><br>He was charming and a great story-teller, regaling me with tales of his career in the music industry. Above all, he seemed like a really good guy.<br><br>For hours afterwards we talked about everything and anything, my mind just as fascinated by him as my body.<br><br>But, once again, the magic only lasted one night.<br><br>In the days that followed, Nick all but vanished with no explanation and I was left feeling disappointed.<br><br>This was one of the first instances I’d experienced of being ghosted (there wasn’t even a term for it back then) and it left me feeling hurt and annoyed.<br><br>Though I wasn’t necessarily after something serious and didn’t need any declarations or grand gestures, ignoring someone – especially after you’ve slept with them – is never OK.<br><br>We even had a conversation during our date where I expressed that respect is really important to me, so I was extra shocked by his behaviour afterwards.<br><br>Perhaps I’d built the experience up too much in my head because Nick had been my knight in shining armour when we met.<br><br>I know that there are people out there who might say I ‘had it coming’ for swapping numbers while on a date with Oliver. Or that doing so is unacceptable date behaviour. To a certain degree, I understand.<br><br>Admittedly, I felt very sheepish about it and I should’ve had the courage to end my evening with Oliver sooner, but this isn’t always as easy as it sounds – especially for women.<br><br>The reality is that we meet people in all manner of ways and sometimes you have to strike while the iron is hot.<br><br>Others may also say that I shouldn’t have slept with Nick on the first date. But I will never apologise for this.<br><br>Sexual limitations – like the ridiculous ‘three-date-rule’ – are usually only put on women. If I want to have sex, I do so.<br><br>My point being, Nick should’ve treated me with respect regardless.<br><br>Despite the bad endings, both of these experiences served as great life lessons. These men helped me realise what I want – and expect – from a future partner.<br><br>Plus, no one is all bad. I like to think that they’ve found someone more suitable to their needs.<br><br>Ironically, I was recently back in the pub where it all started, to have drinks with a man I’ve been seeing for the past few months.<br><br>Remembering the misery of days past made me chuckle. And thankfully, I didn’t need to swap numbers with anyone this time.<br><br>So, How Did It Go? is a weekly Metro.co.uk series that will make you cringe with second-hand embarrassment or ooze with jealousy as people share their worst and best date stories.<br><br>Want to spill the beans about your own awkward encounter or love story?
