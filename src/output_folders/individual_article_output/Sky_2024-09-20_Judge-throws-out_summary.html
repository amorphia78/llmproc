        <h1>Judge throws out charges against Greenpeace activists who scaled Sunak's home</h1><h2>Prosecutors said the former prime minister faced a bill of just under £3,000 for repairs to broken roof tiles. But the judge concluded the evidence was "so tenuous" that no court would convict them.</h2>

    <p>PRIMARY: Four Greenpeace activists (Amy Rugg-Easey, 33, Alexandra Wilson, 32, Mathieu Soete, 38, and Michael Grant, 64) scaled Rishi Sunak&#x27;s grade II-listed manor house using ladders and ropes, draping black fabric over the property during a five-hour demonstration. They were protesting the expansion of oil and gas drilling in the North Sea and targeted Sunak&#x27;s home because issuing new fossil fuel licences was his &quot;personal&quot; decision. A judge threw out criminal damage charges, finding evidence &quot;so tenuous&quot; that no court would convict them.</p>
