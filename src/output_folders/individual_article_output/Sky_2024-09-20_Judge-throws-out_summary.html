    <p>A judge has thrown out charges against four Greenpeace activists who scaled Rishi Sunak&#x27;s home in protest at the expansion of oil and gas drilling in the North Sea.<br><br>Amy Rugg-Easey, 33, Alexandra Wilson, 32, Mathieu Soete, 38, and Michael Grant, 64, were arrested after they used ladders and ropes to climb the grade II-listed manor house in Kirby Sigston, near Northallerton in August last year, draping black fabric over the North Yorkshire property during the five-hour demonstration.<br><br>The four activists had been accused of causing criminal damage to 15 roof slates during the protest. Prosecutors at York Magistrates&#x27; Court said Mr Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty were left with a bill of just under £3,000 for repairs.<br><br>But District Judge Adrian Lower concluded the evidence against the defendants was &quot;so tenuous&quot; that no court would convict them. Defence lawyer Owen Greenhall argued it could not be proved the roof damage was caused during the protest, telling the court: &quot;It&#x27;s clear this is a roof where there is pre-existing damage in areas where the protesters did not go&quot;.</p>

    <p><br><br>During the trial, it was found that three of the 15 pictures used by the prosecution were actually of the same tile taken from different angles, and some had been taken after repairs had been carried out.<br><br>Greenpeace said its demonstration was a response to plans to allow new licences to be granted for further development of North Sea oil and gas off the coast of Scotland.<br><br>Outside court, defendant Michael Grant said: &quot;Justice and common sense prevailed in court today. Peaceful protest is a vital part of our democracy.&quot; He said the activists had targeted Mr Sunak&#x27;s home because it was a &quot;personal&quot; decision for him to issue new fossil fuel licences, adding they knew the then-prime minister and his family were on holiday at the time.</p>
