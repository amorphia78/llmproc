    <p>Walking through the festival, yet another stranger stopped us.<br><br>‘Your little girl is so pretty,’ she smiled.<br><br>I know she thought she was paying us a compliment but she was the sixth person to say something similar to my five-year-old daughter, Nora, that afternoon.<br><br>And I really wished they would stop it.<br><br>It’s a common occurrence when I’m out with Nora and the more this happens, the more it confirms how much unnecessary pressure we put on girls when we constantly comment on their appearance.<br><br>Nora is an excellent climber, she is very funny and independent, yet the more people tell her about how beautiful she is on repeat, the more she asks for make-up or plays at posing in front of the mirror.<br><br>Of course, as a mother, I am predisposed to think both of my children, Nora and her older brother Eric, are beautiful. You’ll have to take my word for it, for privacy reasons I don’t share pictures of my children.<br><br>But Nora happens to be conventionally pretty: she has curly hair, olive skin and brown eyes. And because she is a girl she is told, almost daily, by family, friends, and well-intentioned strangers how gorgeous she is.<br><br>Every time, she smiles humbly and thanks them with the head-down eyes-up kind of bashful smile that women learn to perfect. She loves it. Who wouldn’t?<br><br>I’m telling you this not to brag, but out of concern. Both as a mum and because of my work on gender equality, I can’t help but see how these ‘harmless’ conversations are part of a bigger problem.<br><br>Nora isn’t having to learn to see herself as beautiful – she has already been taught to rely on the outside world to do that for her.<br><br>The sad thing is, though, the world will take that away. She, like every other woman, will inevitably become too fat or too thin; too short or too tall; she’ll be too tanned or not tanned enough.At the moment, I don’t know which it will be but the one thing I do know for sure is that, sooner or later, she will somehow fail to meet the unrealistic standards set for women.And when that happens, will she have built enough self-love to continue seeing herself as the incredible person I see? Or will she be constantly searching for the attention she has grown used to, always trying to meet stupid standards designed to be unreachable?From the moment they are born, girls are taught that beauty is their currency.<br><br>This message is drummed into them through the films they watch and the books they read, where female characters are defined by the way they look – always thin, always with long, fluttering eyelashes.<br><br>It is in the toys they’re offered, with pretend make-up sets available for little ones as young as 36-months-old and, of course, in the clothes they wear.<br><br>Clothing that prioritises looks over comfort, with a lack of pockets, a tighter and shorter fit and flimsier fabric than that used for ‘boys’ clothes; designed to look good, not to explore the world.So whenever people compliment Nora, I’ll add on a casual, ‘Yes, and’, praising another aspect of Nora’s character or personality, telling people how determined or creative she is as well.<br><br>Always loud enough for her to hear.<br><br>These things are true, but they aren’t the things that people see and they aren’t the things she is most celebrated for.<br><br>I also make sure I reply saying how beautiful both my kids are, so her brother Eric hears it.Because what about boys? Boys are rarely told how beautiful they are. Instead, their currency is strength, humour and intelligence.<br><br>When we praise boys for these things and girls for the way they look, we keep feeding the narrative that there is an ‘us’ and ‘them’, with different sets of expectations, rules, demands and needs for the different genders.</p>

    <p>According to a study by the Fawcett Society, three-quarters of parents say boys and girls are treated differently, and 60% say this has a negative impact.<br><br>By ignoring the different ways we celebrate and compliment our children, we continue to uphold dangerously out-of-date gender stereotypes and place unnecessary limitations on young people.<br><br>In that same report, 36% of seven- to 10-year-old girls said that they are made to feel their looks are their most important attribute, contributing to dissatisfaction with their appearance.<br><br>I can’t help but worry about Nora disregarding or neglecting other aspects of herself, targeting more and more of her attention to what she is wearing or how long her curls are.<br><br>I am worried about how much it will hurt her when she inevitably feels the body changes and insecurities of puberty, used as she is to thinking beauty is a big part of who she is.<br><br>If we challenge these things early on we might be able to create a more equitable society, one that is safe for all our children.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
