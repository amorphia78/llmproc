        <h1>Just Stop Oil protesters who threw soup on Van Gogh painting jailed</h1><h2>Anna Holland and Phoebe Plummer, both 22, were found guilty of criminal damage in July</h2><p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil activists, Anna Holland and Phoebe Plummer (both 22), threw tinned tomato soup over Van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers painting at a gallery. While the painting wasn&#x27;t harmed, the soup damaged the 17th-century gold frame. They were sentenced to 20 months and 2 years respectively. Their demands focused on climate action, questioning whether art is &quot;worth more than life&quot; and linking the cost of living crisis to oil dependency.</p>
