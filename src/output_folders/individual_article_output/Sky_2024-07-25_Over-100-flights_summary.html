    <p>PRIMARY: Six climate protesters from Last Generation glued themselves to the runway at Frankfurt Airport after cutting through the perimeter fence, wearing orange vests and carrying &quot;Oil kills&quot; signs. This disrupted around 140 flights, with eight people arrested. The group demands governments end fossil fuel extraction and burning by 2030.<br><br>SECONDARY: Five Last Generation protesters disrupted Cologne-Bonn Airport earlier this week, halting flights for three hours. Similar protests occurred across Europe including at Heathrow, with coordinated actions in Finland, Norway, Spain and Switzerland.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: Germany recently approved legislation imposing harsher penalties on airport trespassers, potentially including two-year prison sentences, as officials call the protests &quot;dangerous, dumb and criminal.&quot;<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral reporting tone while prominently featuring critical official responses condemning the protests.</p>
