    <p>A juicy, contemporary take on Anne Rice’s eerie saga. Plus: pants-based confusion in Taskmaster. Here’s what to watch this evening<br><br>Before her death in 2021, Anne Rice helped to update her juicy vampire story with her executive producer son, Christopher and it’s a contemporary take worth sinking your teeth into. Jacob Anderson stars as Louis de Pointe du Lac, the piercing-eyed vampire who once more meets up with journalist Daniel Molloy to tell him the truth about his life, starting in New Orleans in 1910. Hollie Richardson<br><br>Carol Vorderman and Ashley Banjo host the heartwarming awards bash with famous faces – including Ant and Dec, David Beckham and Alison Hammond – celebrating carers, fundraisers and first responders. This year’s edition includes a special award in honour of the Windrush generation and their contribution to the UK. Graeme Virtue<br><br>The singular Taskmaster vibes have effortlessly incorporated another five comics – and this latest series suggests the show is in no danger of running out of steam. Tonight, poor Alex Horne has to eat a series of bizarre meals created by the contestants and there is pants-based confusion for Julian Clary. Phil Harrison</p>

    <p>The Robert Carlyle-led political crisis thriller returns, with his constantly besieged PM grappling with Extinction Rebellion-style protests and trying to salvage his fracked marriage. Perhaps the return of his daughter Ellie will help? This amped-up opener succeeds via sheer momentum and a killer cliffhanger. GV<br><br>As the odd couple reach the last episode, Seamus (Johnny Flynn) feels the pressure of a live politics show and Janet (Roisin Gallagher) is back at the supermarket. But none of that matters because it’s all about whether they get together in the end. As unpredictable as ever, thanks to more spiky revelations. Hannah Verdier<br><br>Now in its fifth series, this lairy but big-hearted comedy continues to stroll jauntily along – and the characters now sit alongside Derek Trotter and Arthur Daley in the pantheon of lovable TV rogues. Tonight, Tommo (Ryan Sampson) gets a shock: his past catches up with him when a young German appears on the scene claiming to be his son. PH</p></body></html>
