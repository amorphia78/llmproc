        <h1>Just Stop Oil activists jailed after M25 blocked</h1><p>PRIMARY: Five Just Stop Oil activists were jailed for 20-24 months after climbing gantries on the M25 in November 2022, forcing police to stop traffic and causing hours of delays across southern England. The defendants were retired people, students, or recent graduates who pleaded guilty to causing public nuisance. Their aim was to create mass disruption, though the court noted they were willing volunteers rather than organizers.<br><br>SECONDARY: The protests occurred over four successive days in November 2022, closing parts of the motorway across Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire.</p>
