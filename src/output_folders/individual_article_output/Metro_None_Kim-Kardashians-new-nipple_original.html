    <p>Up Next<br><br>Kim Kardashian has never been afraid of a little backlash but her nipple bra has attracted some unexpected attention from Greenpeace.<br><br>She raised eyebrows with her newest launch which is a bra with built in nipples but was quickly hit with accusations of ‘greenwashing’ in the Skims campaign video.<br><br>It’s been a rocky time for launches in the Kardashian world as Kylie Jenner’s new clothing line Khy was called out by fans for seeming to copy other designers, including ex-brother-in-law Kanye, but Kylie has not commented on the claims.<br><br>Kim has already been called out for setting a new unattainable beauty standard for women but Greenpeace took issue with her ‘mockery’ of the climate crisis.<br><br>In her launch of the product the 42-year-old cited ‘the sea levels rising’ and ‘ice sheets melting’ but promised buyers could always look cold no matter the temperature.<br><br>‘The hard truth about Kim’s new “nipple bra” 😞,’ the climate charity wrote on Instagram.<br><br>It continued: ‘Using melting glaciers and rising sea levels as a punchline to improve your profit margins makes a mockery of an issue that is devastating millions of people’s lives.<br><br>‘We desperately need global icons like Kim to champion the fight against climate change. Sadly, this isn’t what’s happening here 😢.<br><br>‘Kim’s new advert perpetuates the harmful profit-driven system accelerating the climate crisis, and diverts attention away from more impactful actions, like the UN Global Plastics Treaty, which offer a real chance for systemic change.’<br><br>Greenpeace accuses the business mogul of ‘co-opting’ the language of climate activists to promote a plastic product.<br><br>The bra is made from nylon, a thermoplastic, and spandex uses a plastic base, which means the bra will not be able to biodegrade should it be thrown away.</p>
