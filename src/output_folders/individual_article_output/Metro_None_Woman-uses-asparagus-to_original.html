    <p>Forget crystal balls and Tarot cards, this fortune teller uses asparagus to predict the future.<br><br>Jemima Packington claims to be able to see into the future by throwing the green vegetable into the air and interpreting how they land.<br><br>In the past she has correctly predicted a number of major events, from Brexit and Andy Murray winning Wimbledon, to Big Brother returning to TV and Harry and Meghan stepping down as working royals.<br><br>She also says she predicted the death of Elizabeth II when she saw a broken crown in her spears.<br><br>However not all of her predictions have been correct – she predicted Croatia would win the World Cup in 2022, but they finished third.<br><br>But how did the Asparamancer’s predictions for 2023 stack up? Metro.co.uk has gone back to her predictions for this year to see how accurate she was.<br><br>Sadly, this prediction did not come true. Football wasn’t coming home for the Women’s World Cup this year after the Lionesses lost 1-0 to Spain in the final on August 20.<br><br>Sarina Wiegman was reportedly tipped to receive an honorary Damehood if she’d managed to lead the Lionesses to victory, but sadly the team didn’t quite make it and there’s no sign of their coach receiving the honour this year.<br><br>This prediction did not come to fruition in King Charles’s New Years’ Honours list for 2023, as Gareth Southgate was not included.<br><br>However, the list for 2024, due to be released in the coming days, has not yet been published – so there is still a chance that Gareth Southgate could be included in that list and, technically, prove the Asparamancer right.<br><br>Follow us to receive the latest news updates from Metro (Picture: Getty Images)<br><br>Metro’s on Whatsapp! Join our community for breaking news and juicy stories.<br><br>Well, Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have managed to keep hold of power this year, despite numerous by-election losses and the sacking of Home Secretary Suella Braverman.<br><br>The PM faced a revolt within his own party as he lost support over his rejigged Rwanda bill after their original plans were deemed unlawful – but he clung onto power as the bill squeaked past with a majority of just 44.<br><br>Mr Sunak has faced increased criticism over his failure to tackle four out of the five priorities he set out when he took charge at the end of 2022.<br><br>While inflation has halved this year, it’s not clear how much of this was down to the Tories – and so far they have failed to grow the economy, reduce debt, cut NHS waiting lists, and ‘stop the boats’.<br><br>So we’d say Jemima was correct in this prediction.<br><br>We reckon the Asparamancer is half correct in this prediction.<br><br>Thankfully we’re not in a position where food rationing has been considered – but there were wide scale food shortages earlier this year after bad weather and transport issues in Africa and Europe left shelves bare.<br><br>People certainly have become more savvy when it comes to making food go further and cutting waste – but this is more likely caused by the cost of living crisis and increasing food prices.<br><br>Although the occasional person here and there might be turning their garden into a farm, we’ve not seen this on a wider scale, so we think this one is a miss from the Asparamancer.<br><br>Plus, while allotments are indeed popular, it doesn’t look like that popularity has increased during 2023.<br><br>Unemployment has continued to drop this year – in September to November 2023, the estimated number of vacancies dropped by 45,000, to 949,000.<br><br>But the Office for National Statistics doesn’t track vacancies within agriculture, so it’s hard to know whether the jobless have been seeking out employment in this sector.<br><br>Without the data, we’re going to have to leave this one as a question mark.<br><br>Some of the most disruptive strike action has come to an end this year, with the RMT union accepting a deal last month to end the long-term dispute over pay and conditions.<br><br>But action across a variety of sectors is far from over, with one A&amp;E department forced to close over Christmas due to striking junior doctors.<br><br>While some strike action may have tried the public’s sympathy, it’s not universal across all sectors.<br><br>Polling by YouGov found that 63% of adults support nursing strikes, 61% support striking ambulance staff, 58% support striking junior doctors and 45% support striking senior doctors.<br><br>But the same poll found only 41% support striking rail workers, 38% support striking university staff, 37% support striking train drivers, and only 27% support striking driving examiners.<br><br>So, as it’s a mixed bag across the board, we’ll give the Asparamancer half a point on this one.<br><br>Jemima was also correct with this prediction, as Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank welcomed their second child, Ernest George Ronnie Brooksbank, on May 30.</p>

    <p>We’d also say Jemima was correct in this prediction.<br><br>The coronation of King Charles III was widely celebrated both across the UK and worldwide – and wasn’t disrupted by the appearance of the Duke of Sussex.<br><br>Tensions between China and Hong Kong heightened in 2023, as China cracked down on dissent, and pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai went on trial accused of breaching national security – a trial widely seen as a test of Hong Kong’s judicial independence.<br><br>North and South Korea also continue to remain at odds, with North Korea launching its biggest missile in March and leader Kim Jong-un visiting Russia to discuss his support of the war in Ukraine.<br><br>So we’ll give the Asparamancer a point for this one.<br><br>Unfortunately this is a fail for Jemima.<br><br>While Buckingham Palace quietly removed Harry’s HRH title from their website, and legislation to strip Harry and Meghan of their titles was considered in parliament, neither they or any other royal have been stripped of their titles.<br><br>Princess Anne was named as the hardest working royal in 2023, attending 457 official engagements throughout the year.<br><br>And it appears the Princess Royal is still in great health at 73 – meaning, thankfully, this prediction is not correct.<br><br>It’s difficult to avoid talk of climate change when London’s streets are regularly blocked by Just Stop Oil protesters, and major events including cricket matches and Wimbledon were disrupted.<br><br>COP28 was hosted by the UAE this year, where nations agreed to ‘transition away’ from using fossil fuels after days of negotiations.<br><br>And in July the UN’s general secretary warned that the era of global warming had ended and instead the world has moved into a phase of ‘global boiling’ – very ominous.<br><br>So yes, climate change has certainly been on everyone’s minds this year.<br><br>Friends fans were shocked when Matthew Perry passed away on October 28.<br><br>We’ve lost a number of hugely iconic celebrities this year, from Sinéad O’Connor to Shane MacGowan, and not all of these deaths were related to age – so sadly, the Asparamancer was correct here.<br><br>One high profile figure who has drawn significant criticism this year was Baroness Michelle Mone.<br><br>The Tory peer admitted she made an ‘error’ in denying her links to Medpro, and admitted ‘lying’ to the press that she stood to benefit from the contracts between the PPE firm and the government.<br><br>She said it’s ‘not a crime’ to lie to the press about being a beneficiary of Medpro’s financial trusts, which hold some £60 million profit from the deal.<br><br>A number of A-listers have come out as being part of the LGBTQ+ community in 2023.<br><br>The Last Of Us star Bella Ramsey came out as gender fluid this year, while Stranger Things actor Noah Schnapp came out as gay and the new Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa, came out as queer in August – although he stopped short of defining his sexuality.<br><br>So yes, we’d call this prediction correct.<br><br>Chelsea struggled with one of the toughest seasons in its history in 2022-23, with new leadership at the top of the club and a number of defeats, including a 3-1 loss to Arsenal.<br><br>It’s hoped the rocky season has laid the foundations for a return to future glories in 2023-24, but that’s still yet to be seen, so this prediction is a miss.<br><br>Both Wasps RFC and Worcester RFC went into administration at the end of 2022, and things didn’t get much better during 2023 as London Irish also went into administration in June.<br><br>The Leicester Tigers and Exeter Chiefs were also on shaky ground this year, so there are definitely ongoing concerns about the future of professional rugby.<br><br>We say the Asparamancer was right with this one.<br><br>There were certainly changes for pupils this year, as GCSE and A Level pupils started having Covid support removed and many ended up learning in temporary classrooms due to the RAAC concrete crisis.<br><br>The government also said it would crack down on ‘rip off’ degrees with poor career prospects.<br><br>But in terms of major reforms in education, there wasn’t much going on there in 2023, so we’ll give the Asparamancer half a point..<br><br>This one’s pretty straightforward, and Jemima is correct – the UK did not rejoin the EU in 2023.<br><br>Out of the Asparamancer’s 20 predictions for 2023, by our count, she got 11-and-a-half of them correct.<br><br>Not a bad effort at all, but maybe Jemima needs to tune up her asparagus-reading skills in time for her 2024 predictions…<br><br>Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.<br><br>For more stories like this, check our news page.<br><br>Stay up to date with the stories everybody’s talking about.<br><br>This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.
