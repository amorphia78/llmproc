    <p>I couldn’t imagine ITV sinking lower than signing Matt Hancock up for I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! but apparently, I was wrong.<br><br>Every year Nigel Farage gets listed as one of the names tipped to be heading into the jungle and every year I’ve taken comfort knowing that a) with an ego like that he probably thinks it’s beneath him and b) surely ITV would never cast the man who steered the ship of the UK into the iceberg that is Brexit and continues to fuel unthinkable hostility towards immigrants and countless minorities.<br><br>If there was ever a care for anyone who has suffered at the mouthpiece of Farage, there is no way a broadcaster in their responsible mind would platform him on their most popular programme of the year.<br><br>On Monday it was confirmed Farage would be joining the likes of This Morning’s Josie Gibson and Britney Spears’ notoriously dull sister Jamie Lynn.<br><br>If ITV wants headlines, they’ve got them. If they want viewers, however, I expect they’ve made a huge misfire and reportedly paid Farage £1.5million just to spark thousands of complaints and alienate much of the show’s fanbase for its even returned.<br><br>After arrogantly boasting that he was toying with signing his seven-figure contract on his GB News show, he’s now gloated that he’s quietly optimistic that he’ll be crowned the next King of the Jungle and he has every right to be – he probably will.<br><br>He’s determined to change the public’s perception of him and, again, he probably will.<br><br>‘The idea that somehow the things I represent – mean-spirited, small-minded, nasty, the “little Englander” – all those accusations that have been flung at me over the years just aren’t true. If we can dispel some of those misconceptions, then that will be a good thing too,’ he said of entering the jungle.<br><br>He is all those things though, we’ve seen it time and time again.<br><br>His scaremongering and attempts to incite racial hatred have consistently been based on blatant lies, but it doesn’t seem to matter when he got what he wanted. The damage has been done and many of us are subsequently scared by words and images such as the disgraceful UKIP ‘Breaking Point’ poster from 2016, which inflamed tensions at the time.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.

He may not have exactly left the jungle a hero, but his reputation certainly benefitted from I’m A Celebrity.</p>

    <p>Farage has the potential to do much more harm than Hancock though. For a start, he’s much more influential and after being filmed shamelessly dancing and fist-pumping with Priti Patel to Can’t Take My Eyes Off You, it’s widely speculated he’s being gradually welcomed back to the Tory Party or at the very least into Parliament.<br><br>If anything, to me, a stint on I’m A Celebrity seems to back this up with a perfect opportunity to win over a new legion of fans before making a big political comeback.<br><br>Hancock had already resigned from cabinet and his future as an MP was clearly in tatters, but Farage has an intensely loyal following that hangs on to his every word. With the Tory Party polls on a downward trajectory and so many people feeling politically lost, his potential to influence I’m a Celebrity viewers is terrifying.<br><br>Sorry, this video isn&#x27;t available any more.<br><br>His flippantly dangerous language to describe immigrants and essentially anyone who falls outside of a typical former UKIP voter already has a big enough platform to the relatively few people who watch GB News, let alone prime time on ITV in front of 10million people.<br><br>I’d hope the UK is less susceptible to his brash charms in 2023 than they were before 2016, but whatever your opinion of Farage, he’s proven to be deceivingly clever.<br><br>In I’m A Celebrity, his politics would probably eventually be ignored. His frustratingly approachable personality would shine through and – as we saw last year – if anyone was to confront him for putting the country in the bin with Brexit and wrecking the livelihood of millions, they’d be called out for ‘bullying’.<br><br>Subsequently though, his appearance on I’m A Celebrity would have huge political consequences when suddenly millions of people bowled over by him in the jungle end up voting for him at an election – if he runs in the future.<br><br>When I’m A Celebrity has consistently pulled in millions of viewers for the last 20 years without resorting to enlisting such destructive figures for attention, it’s gutting to watch it stoop so low now.<br><br>Is ITV so desperate for figures it would blow up its dignity so sensationally?<br><br>In 2022, backlash from viewers and Ofcom complaints warned I’m A Celebrity how wounded the public has been by various political catastrophes and that we don’t want our pain to be dismissed for entertainment. Audiences were quite rightly outraged when Hancock entered the jungle but, more importantly, they were hurt.<br><br>Farage may put I’m A Celebrity all over the front pages and I wouldn’t be surprised if he won.<br><br>But it will certainly make having any faith in the show feel impossible.<br><br>In a month’s time there is every chance Farage he will win over a huge fan base and lay down the perfect foundation for his political comeback.<br><br>Sorry, this video isn&#x27;t available any more.<br><br>He’ll be voted for every Bushtucker trial, come out of each one disguised a team player eating a kangaroo’s anus for the sake of his team and not because he knows people will forget the misery he caused and start to like him.<br><br>ITV is playing with fire. It’s not an exaggeration that in the long run they could be playing with lives if he’s given the power to put his political ambitions before the genuine needs of the people, making us poorer, causing more hostility to minority groups and generally more miserable.<br><br>Everyone behind this decision should be ashamed.
