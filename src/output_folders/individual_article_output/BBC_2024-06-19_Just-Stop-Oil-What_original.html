        <h1>Just Stop Oil: What is it and what are its goals?</h1><p>Just Stop Oil activists have sprayed orange powder paint on parts of Stonehenge.<br><br>The environmental campaign group has carried out many high-profile protests, including blocking roads, stopping play at sports matches and halting theatre productions.<br><br>It wants action on climate change, but its tactics are controversial.<br><br>Just Stop Oil (JSO) wants the UK to stop approving new fossil fuel projects, which are a major cause of climate change.<br><br>However, in July 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that 100 new North Sea licences had been granted.<br><br>And in November, he said further licences would be awarded annually.<br><br>The group says it uses &quot;non-violent civil resistance&quot; and will stop protesting when the government announces an end to fossil-fuel production.<br><br>Just Stop Oil is linked to other environmental groups, including Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain.<br><br>The group came to prominence when its activists shut down major roads such as the M25 and Dartford crossing in November 2022.<br><br>Since then, JSO has also targeted several major sporting events, including the Wimbledon tennis championships, the second Ashes Test at Lord&#x27;s cricket ground and the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield.<br><br>Cultural events, including a performance of the musical Les Miserables in London and a BBC Proms concert at the Royal Albert Hall, have also been disrupted.<br><br>In the National Gallery, supporters threw tomato soup over Vincent Van Gogh&#x27;s painting Sunflowers and smashed the protective glass screen on Diego Velazquez&#x27;s Rokeby Venus.<br><br>JSO protesters also damaged the case around the Magna Carta, at the British Library.<br><br>In June 2024, two activists were arrested on suspicion of damaging Stonehenge, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) world heritage site.<br><br>Just Stop Oil said the orange powder paint was cornflour and would &quot;wash away with rain&quot;.<br><br>English Heritage chief executive, Dr Nick Merriman, said there appeared to be &quot;no visible damage&quot; after experts cleaned the site.<br><br>But Mr Sunak said it was a &quot;disgraceful act of vandalism&quot;, while Labour leader Keir Starmer called it &quot;outrageous&quot; and JSO &quot;pathetic&quot;.<br><br>The maximum penalty for the wilful obstruction of a highway in England and Wales is 51 weeks in prison. Offenders can also be fined.<br><br>Several transport bodies, including National Highways and Transport for London, have sought High Court injunctions to prevent protesters disrupting major roads.<br><br>Anyone breaching an injunction can be held in contempt of court, and could face imprisonment, an unlimited fine and seizure of assets.<br><br>In 2023, Parliament passed new anti-protest legislation under the Public Order Act.</p><p>This gives powers to prosecute someone who interferes with the operation or use of key national infrastructure in England and Wales - including roads, railways, and air transport.<br><br>Previously, the police could generally only restrict a protest if they could show it may result in &quot;serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community&quot;.<br><br>The new legislation lowers the threshold for &quot;serious disruption&quot;, allowing police to respond to action which prevents or delays day-to-day activities such as completing a journey.<br><br>It also made &quot;locking-on&quot; - whereby protesters attach themselves to buildings, objects or other people - a criminal offence.<br><br>Many Just Stop Oil activists have used this tactic.<br><br>In May 2024, BBC News reported a review into tackling political violence, by Lord Walney, would suggest &quot;extreme protest groups&quot; such as JSO could be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations.<br><br>The plan could limit the activities of organisations that have a policy of using criminal offences or causing serious disruption to influence government or public debate.<br><br>At the time, the Home Office said ministers would consider the recommendations - but the general election was called a few weeks later and it is now unclear when or if Lord Walney&#x27;s report will be published.<br><br>In response, JSO said the government were the &quot;dangerous radicals that are endangering all of us&quot;, through its climate policies.<br><br>In December 2023, the Met Police said it had spent Â£20m policing JSO protests and the time spent on the group equated to roughly 300 officers being removed front-line policing each day.<br><br>It said the group &quot;refused to engage&quot; with police when planning protests.<br><br>&quot;Our desire is that Just Stop Oil come forward and speak with us, so we can actually work with them,&quot; Cdr Kyle Gordon said.<br><br>&quot;We absolutely understand and support the fundamental right to protest within a democratic society - but what we&#x27;ve got to do is balance that right with the rights of everybody else who is using this city.&quot;<br><br>In the past Just Stop Oil has quoted a 2021 Supreme Court ruling which found there should be a &quot;certain degree of tolerance to disruption to ordinary life, including the disruption of traffic&quot;, as a result of non-violent protest.<br><br>According to its website, most of its money comes from the Climate Emergency Fund - a US network which has supported climate activism since 2019.<br><br>That is part-funded by US philanthropist Aileen Getty, the granddaughter of petrol tycoon J Paul Getty.<br><br>Just Stop Oil says it also receives donations from the public and other organisations concerned about climate change.</p></body></html>
