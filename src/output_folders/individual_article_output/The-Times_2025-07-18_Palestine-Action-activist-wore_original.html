    <p>The Crillon Ball is described by Tatler as the “world’s most glamorous debutante ball”.

    <p>The protesters, who held signs that read “I support Palestine Action”, risked prison as the direct action group was banned under the Terrorism Act from July 5.<br><br>Crosland said he hoped the protests will “expose the absurdity” of the proscription.<br><br>In a briefing for activists taking part in the protests last week, Crosland said the ban “is like something out of George Orwell, it’s a mad insult to the intelligence of us all”.
