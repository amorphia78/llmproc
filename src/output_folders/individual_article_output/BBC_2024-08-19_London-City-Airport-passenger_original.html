    <p>The annual passenger cap will increase from 6.5 million to 9 million at London City Airport under plans approved by the government.<br><br>Another proposal to extend the airport&#x27;s Saturday cut-off time for flights from 12:30 to 18:30 was rejected following an appeal decision published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.<br><br>Alison FitzGerald, the airport&#x27;s chief executive, welcomed raising the passenger cap but said she was &quot;disappointed&quot; the curfew was not changed.<br><br>Greenpeace said the approval &quot;undermines the UK’s climate leadership&quot; and would &quot;mostly benefit an elite of wealthy frequent fliers&quot;.<br><br>The increased passenger cap will be met by an increase in the number of morning flights from 06:00 to 09:00, with the condition that quieter aircraft are used during this time.<br><br>The airport said it would have only allowed &quot;cleaner, quieter, next generation aircraft&quot; in the extended period.<br><br>Newham Council&#x27;s strategic development committee unanimously rejected the proposals from the airport in July 2023 but an appeal was brought to the Planning Inspectorate.<br><br>One of the primary issues cited by the committee was around noise and changes to the &quot;weekend respite&quot; rule which has been in place for 25 years.<br><br>The Mayor of Newham, Rokhsana Fiaz, said she had concerns about the impact of more aircraft noise on residents, but welcomed the government’s acceptance that the Saturday cut-off would remain in place.<br><br>She said: &quot;I remain deeply concerned that our residents will be seriously harmed by the impact of further air-flight noise with today’s decision to allow an increase in flights in the early mornings throughout the rest of the week.</p>

    <p>&quot;We will be studying the decision notice carefully and considering all options as we remain concerned about the detrimental impacts on the health and quality of life of our residents.&quot;<br><br>Ms FitzGerald said: &quot;Rejecting our request to extend our Saturday afternoon operating hours will slow down airlines bringing cleaner, quieter next generation aircraft to the airport.<br><br>&quot;Local residents would have had the added benefit of these aircraft operating at the airport throughout the week, not just in the extended operating hours.&quot;<br><br>The decision was taken by Angela Rayner, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, and Louise Haigh, the Secretary of State for Transport.<br><br>A letter announcing their decision said: &quot;The Secretaries of State also agree that the reduction in curfew would not facilitate a reduction in total noise effects.&quot;<br><br>The cabinet ministers agreed that the increased passenger cap was needed to meet a growth in demand at the airport.<br><br>Paul Morozzo, climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: &quot;This decision is a surprisingly clumsy misstep from our new government.<br><br>&quot;Over half of the destinations served by the airport can be reached by train in under six hours, with Amsterdam and Edinburgh among the most popular routes.&quot;<br><br>As well as Newham, the proposals had been opposed by eight other London councils near the airport along with a local campaign groups.<br><br>BBC News has contacted the Department for Transport for comment.<br><br>Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.
