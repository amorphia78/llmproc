    <p>PRIMARY: Environmental group Shut the System claimed supporters cut cables and glued electrical cabinets at JP Morgan Chase and Allianz offices, and cut 5G cables at Barclaycard&#x27;s Northampton HQ. The group demands financial institutions stop fossil fuel financing and adopt climate-aligned targets, threatening escalation by October if ignored. They targeted these companies for being major fossil fuel investors and insurers.<br><br>SECONDARY: The group previously sabotaged fibre optic cables in the City in January, causing significant internet slowdowns.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article discusses how these clandestine tactics differ from more accountable groups like Extinction Rebellion, and mentions recent harsh sentences for environmental activists under new anti-protest laws.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral, factual tone while reporting the activists&#x27; claims and police response.</p></body></html>
