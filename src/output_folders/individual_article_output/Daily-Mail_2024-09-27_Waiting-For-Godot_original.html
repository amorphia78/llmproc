    <p>Verdict: Exquisite torture<br><br>Midnight always strikes and the time was always going to come. Because, gentle reader, although I have been a critic for decades now, I have managed to avoid Waiting For Godot. Although I read the play at school, as far as Samuel Beckett&#x27;s masterpiece of existential despair goes, I remained, until now, virgo intacto.<br><br>One of the reasons I&#x27;ve avoided this parable of futility was that I thought I &#x27;got&#x27; it so didn&#x27;t need to see the work in its meagre flesh. Also, I&#x27;d heard so much about it, it was as if I&#x27;d seen it already. It is, after all, micro-managed by the Beckett Estate, which demands strict adherence to stage directions. So I was met by the same grey lunar landscape and dead tree found in all past productions. The only difference was that this time it stars Lucien Msamati and Ben Whishaw in the tale of two tramps that has waylaid thesps including Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart since 1952.<br><br>The set-up of the two men waiting in vain for the arrival of a legendary saviour called Godot is notorious. The great 20th-century theatre critic Kenneth Tynan remarked that one glance at the cast list ensures you know the outcome: Godot never arrives. Spoiler alert: there is no spoiler. The message is summed up by the bleak line &#x27;we are born astride the grave, daylight gleams for an instant, then it is night once more&#x27;. It is not enough to &#x27;get&#x27; the play, it must also be endured.<br><br>Happily (and I use that word advisedly) it is better on the stage than the page. To read, it&#x27;s a gloomy blueprint for giving up. Yet in performance it&#x27;s an almost cheerful Laurel and Hardy double act interrupted by a grandiloquent squire called Pozzo (Jonathan Slinger) driving a human pack animal, Lucky (Tom Edden).<br><br>Since Godot never arrives, killing time is the order of the night, and here the filthy looking Msamati and Whishaw do it masterfully. Whishaw is the skinny Stan Laurel – the nervier, twitching one, who&#x27;s also delicate and wistful. Msamati is the older, plumper Oliver Hardy father figure afflicted with sore feet. He is sadder, more sardonic, and cranky.<br><br>Slinger, however, almost steals the show as the haughty squire in a Homburg hat. Needy and craving approval, he provokes the envy and contempt of the tramps by glugging a bottle of wine and munching a chicken leg. He in turn is upstaged by Edden as Lucky, a slobbering zombie who erupts into a nonsensical speech of theological gobbledygook.<br><br>James Macdonald has clearly scoured the text for its morsels of amusement and crumbs of comfort. So, although I have nothing to compare it with, I suspect that this is as good as it gets. I tired over its pitiless two-hour, 40-minute duration, and perhaps we are supposed to. But for me at least, the wait is over. I&#x27;ve kept my appointment with Godot after all.<br><br>Until December 14.<br><br>Verdict: Stars and strikes<br><br>The great American playwright Arthur Miller told the great American director Elia Kazan he would never work with him again after Kazan denounced friends as communists to the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952. David Edgar&#x27;s absorbing play asks why he did it and why Miller, who was also subpoenaed by the Committee in 1956, did in fact work with Kazan again, on his play After The Fall.<br><br>In short, it&#x27;s about idealism versus pragmatism. Typically of Edgar, who&#x27;s revered for complex political plays, it is a densely argued series of discussions. Thankfully, Kazan&#x27;s first wife (Molly Day Thacher) and Miller&#x27;s second wife (Marilyn Monroe) bring much-needed emotional ventilation. Left to their own devices, the men&#x27;s exchanges can sound like the turgid minutes of the Committee itself.<br><br>In James Dacre&#x27;s nicely pitched production, Shaun Evans&#x27;s Kazan is an ethical gadfly justifying shopping his friends on the grounds that they deserved it, he just wanted to work, and they&#x27;d have done the same. Michael Aloni&#x27;s Miller lookalike is an ethical puritan who wasn&#x27;t in quite such a tight spot having never (unlike Kazan) been a Communist Party member.<br><br>Faye Castelow as Molly makes the men cut to the chase, while Jasmine Blackborow&#x27;s Marilyn insists Miller stand by his refusal to name names (for which he got a suspended one-year prison sentence). This is certainly well-worn territory, so why now? Surely because America is once more openly at odds with itself.<br><br>Until October 19.<br><br>Shakespeare&#x27;s Coriolanus was the Roy Keane of the ancient world. A Roman warrior who &#x27;waxed like a sea&#x27;, and struck down towns &#x27;like a planet&#x27;. More than this, and like the ex-Manchester United captain, he&#x27;s a red-mist artist with a whopping temper. Sadly, though, this startling trait is missing from a mostly courteous Coriolanus played by David Oyelowo — best known as peacemaking Martin Luther King in the 2014 film Selma.<br><br>Ask him to stoop to make his case for being honoured as a Consul by the people of Rome, as he is here, and the normally hair-triggered General can be counted on to throw a catastrophic wobbly. He&#x27;s wound up more easily than a wristwatch. Yet Lyndsey Turner&#x27;s spectacular production turns his story into a portentous version of dystopian sci-fi movies The Hunger Games. Underpinned by a cinematic soundtrack, the play&#x27;s serious musings on political populism barely get a look-in.<br><br>Instead, the neo-fascist brutalism of Es Devlin&#x27;s stunningly lit set dominates. Set mostly in a museum, amid pillars, busts and the famous statue of Romulus and Remus suckling at a she-wolf, this historical past is also the living present for characters including protesters who vandalise it (in an easy nod to Just Stop Oil).<br><br>The cast spend a lot of time distractingly re-arranging furniture, as if on a photo shoot. This might have triggered a more irascible Coriolanus, but Oyelowo&#x27;s warlord is too self-possessed. He&#x27;s more a tetchy Raheem Sterling than a bone-crunching midfielder with a volcanic temper. No one need be afraid.<br><br>Until November 9.<br><br>Verdict: Hit and miss<br><br>A Face In The Crowd is a new musical by Elvis Costello. It has some great beats and fine lyric writing, but a much less incisive grasp of American politics. Based on Elia Kazan&#x27;s 1957 film, it&#x27;s about a rough-neck drifter called Lonesome Rhodes given a chance to let rip on radio thanks to a radical young talk show host called Marcia.</p>

    <p>When ratings for Marcia&#x27;s programme soar, Larry is offered a platform on TV where he gets out of hand and is chosen to fortify a mousey Republican in a campaign for President. Naturally we&#x27;re meant to think of muck-raking shock-jocks like Steve Bannon endorsing Donald Trump.<br><br>Costello&#x27;s eclectic musical score features good, rocky numbers galore and the title song is an anthemic lung buster with a Gospel undertow. Country and Western tunes add apple pie sweetness and Costello proves himself a fine jingle writer in a spoof ad for a pep pill called Vitajax, before a virile hoedown about eating red meat, Blood and Hot Sauce.<br><br>None of that quite unifies a show driven with verve and energy by Ramin Karimloo as Mr Rhodes. He strums vigorously, sings potently and makes political bile taste like cotton candy. But that&#x27;s not enough to create chemistry with Anoushka Lucas&#x27;s rather prim Marcia and her sad and quailing voice reminiscent of Nora Jones.<br><br>Kwame Kwei-Armah has assembled a good team for his farewell production at the Young Vic, but the cast feel like they&#x27;re rattling around in yawning spaces on Anna Fleischle&#x27;s retro Fifties set. Musically it&#x27;s a pleasant two and a half hours, but satirically it&#x27;s not quite hitting the proverbial cow&#x27;s ass with a banjo.<br><br>Verdict: True confessions of a con artiste<br><br>Reviewed by Georgina Brown for the Daily Mail<br><br>Did you know that the 43 quintillion combinations of a Rubik&#x27;s cube would extend from the Earth to Pluto 730 times? In his latest fiendish show, Asi Wind &#x27;solves&#x27; two cubes simultaneously, one in each hand, eyes shut, in a few tense seconds. It looks like magic but it&#x27;s clearly for real; a breath-taking demonstration of Wind&#x27;s mental agility (the solution lies in an algorithm), awesome memory and sleight of both hands.<br><br>Which is his point. Wind turns the idea of magic on its head. &#x27;I&#x27;m going to lie to you a lot,&#x27; he says, placing his metaphorical – and literal - pack of cards on the table. There&#x27;s a gleam in his eyes. Believe me, nobody lies better than Wind.<br><br>Dressed casually in black, he looks more like a maths teacher than a showman. Less a talker than a doer, there&#x27;s nothing magical about his flat patter. And yet, over 80 giddying, gasp-inducing minutes, he reads minds, memorises a pack of cards, reveals the songs from a secret playlist, tears a page from Animal Farm, burns it to a cinder and reattaches it, without breaking a sweat.<br><br>In one &#x27;trick&#x27;, he fiddles with a teeny piece of clay. Suddenly, the recognisable profile of a person whose name had been written on a postcard by a random member of the audience, emerges, through shadow-play, on a screen.<br><br>In another, using dayglo paint, he brushes abstract shapes onto four canvases which, fitted together, create the portrait of another celeb, &#x27;selected&#x27; by a member of the audience. The unmistakable image of X glows in the dark.<br><br>My daughter was one of those invited on to the stage to hold a balloon. He gave one of them – my daughter&#x27;s – a mind of its own.<br><br>As he says, it&#x27;s all lies. But seeing is believing. Wind is a consummate fraudster, a con artiste extraordinaire.<br><br>Verdict: No sets, no ideas except daft ones, well-sung<br><br>Opera by Tully Potter for the Daily Mail<br><br>The stage is so bare, the clothing so inappropriate, that the sets and the period costumes must have been hijacked by Putin&#x27;s operatives. The pesky man gets in everywhere. But of course, you can get lovely nearly-new garments from hospice shops.<br><br>The director must have been kidnapped by people smugglers and carried off to Rwanda; but how marvellous it is that the cast and chorus have been able to make things up as they go along! It is all in the best spirit of World War II…<br><br>Unfortunately, they have not read the libretto – based on Pushkin&#x27;s verse novel – very carefully, so some daft things happen. And there is a distinct absence of serfs to fetch and carry, as there would be in early 19th-century Russia.<br><br>Madame Larina and the nurse Filipyevna carry their own chairs on at the start and I soon begin to worry about those chairs (if there were three, we could all sing &#x27;Three chairs for Tchaikovsky!&#x27;) The chairs are used by Olga to take down Tatyana&#x27;s letter to Onegin – as she misses out much of it, he must be a clairvoyant to read it.<br><br>One chair soon disappears. The other pops up in the most unlikely places, even the duel scene, and serves for Olga to do very naughty things with Onegin (he&#x27;s the Mr Darcy character) which are not in Pushkin or the libretto.<br><br>The poet Lensky (the tragic equivalent of Mr Bingley) is supposed to be shot by Onegin but for some reason commits suicide. The cast must have worked out that if the gun happened to be live, none of them could be sued or arraigned, as happened to poor Alex Baldwin over that unfortunate Western.<br><br>How democratic it is that the same people who came in from working in the fields in Scene 1 are somehow at the grand ball in St Petersburg six years later, in the same charity shop clothes. The dancing is more redolent of Theresa May than the Mariinsky Theatre, but one has to make allowances.<br><br>Oh … the singing is rather good. Armenian tenor Liparit Avetisyan is a lyrical, plangent Lensky and Kristina Mkhitaryan, a Russian of Armenian heritage, is an affecting Tatyana. American contralto Avery Amereau convinces as Olga and Canadian baritone Gordon Bintner brings fine tone to Onegin. Brindley Sherratt, interrupting his holiday to replace a Russian afflicted by the Curse of Putin, is Gremin to the life. Other roles are well taken.<br><br>That the audience enjoys it all must mainly be down to conductor Henrik Nanasi, who secures excellent orchestral playing and choral singing. If those listed as director and set designer, Ted Huffman and Hyemi Shin, want to donate their fees to charity, I suggest the Distressed Poseurs&#x27; Foundation.</p>
