    <p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil student supporters daubed the historic Radcliffe Camera building at Oxford University with orange spray paint in protest at the government&#x27;s plans to license new oil and gas projects. The protest targeted the university building&#x27;s main entrance and exit, forcing temporary closure of the reading room. The protesters demanded university leaders nationwide make public statements calling on the government to end new oil and gas projects. Two men aged 18 and 21 were arrested for criminal damage.</p>
