    <p>Labour donor Dale Vince is in line for a £25m windfall after a British green energy supplier was snapped up by a company backed by the United Arab Emirates.<br><br>As the largest shareholder in Good Energy, Mr Vince will receive the payout after the business was bought by Dubai-based Esyasof for £99.4m.<br><br>Mr Vince owns around a quarter of Good Energy through his business Ecotricity, meaning he will receive around £25m from the takeover.<br><br>On Monday, the tycoon said the deal would be “good for the company” and shareholders, accusing the existing board of having destroyed value.<br><br>He previously tried to buy Good Energy himself in 2021 but was rebuffed.<br><br>Esyasof is based in Dubai and controlled by the Abu Dhabi International Holding Company.<br><br>That holding company is in turn chaired by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the son of UAE founder Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.<br><br>Mr Vince, who boasts a £100m fortune and is known as “Britain’s richest hippie”, has become one of Labour’s biggest donors after handing the party £5m.<br><br>He has also donated to climate protest groups Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, although he withdrew financial support for the former after claiming it had become too extreme.<br><br>In the past year, he has also criticised Israel’s counter-offensive against Hamas terrorists in Gaza, claiming it has resulted in the “brutalisation” and “genocide” of Palestinian civilians.<br><br>Mr Vince’s windfall from a company based in the UAE may raise eyebrows, given the country’s ranking as one of the world’s top petrostates and its dismal human rights record.<br><br>His business, Ecotricity, claims to be “Britain’s greenest energy company” with a banner on its website saying: “Let’s end fossil fuels!”<br><br>Asked whether any aspects of the deal with Esyasof made him uncomfortable, Mr Vince told The Telegraph: “With the petrostate issue, I think they actually need to be pivoting into green energy so it would be a bit perverse to object to that, wouldn’t it? They need to change their business model.<br><br>“On human rights, that is a valid point. But human rights are bad across the Middle East – look at what is happening in Gaza, look at the genocide Israel is perpetrating against Gaza, look at Saudi Arabia.<br><br>“There are also issues in America as well, and even in the UK. I mean, I’m going to a protest on Wednesday to protest on behalf of eco-protesters who have been locked up.<br><br>“This is a human rights issue – the right to protest peacefully without being jailed.<br><br>“Human rights are an issue probably around most of the world. You could say, well, why buy anything from China? They don’t have a great human rights record.<br><br>“But [people] still buy things from China.”<br><br>Esyasof said on Monday that it had received “irrevocable” undertakings from Mr Vince’s business for the sale of 4.8m shares in Good Energy.</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, the tycoon has sparked controversy for demanding a ban on political donations – despite his own contributions to Labour – and for his plans to build a gigantic solar farm in the Lincolnshire countryside.<br><br>Ed Miliband’s Energy Department approved an application for Heckington Fen Solar Park last week, which is being built by Ecotricity, despite warnings it would “trash” local landscapes. Mr Miliband recused himself from the decision.<br><br>On Monday, Mr Vince branded objections about the development’s impact on the countryside “silly” and argued that it would have a positive impact on the environment by helping to negate climate change.<br><br>“It’s an essential way to make green energy,” he said. “People talk about biodiversity impacts, but actually we can boost biodiversity with the solar project over and above farming because farming is not good for biodiversity.<br><br>“So in terms of view and nature, solar projects are an improvement for nature.<br><br>“I just don’t think they’re a problem in terms of the view, because you can’t see them very far away - a hedgerow will obscure the view of a solar project.<br><br>“So I don’t understand the concerns. It’s an exaggeration to say we’re carpeting Lincolnshire – [the county] has half a million hectares of land and it’s less than 1pc.”<br><br>He has insisted it is “cheap” and “cynical” of critics to suggest his status as a Labour donor in any way influenced the Government’s decision to approve the scheme.<br><br>“Being a donor does not give me access or influence,” he said.<br><br>“I’m against carbon capture and storage, I’m against nuclear, I’m against heat pumps. And all of these are, at the moment, government policies.”<br><br>Mr Vince’s windfall from Good Energy comes as he separately grapples with the £40m divorce settlement granted to his ex-wife following a High Court battle this month.<br><br>Lawyers for Kate Vince argued that her ex-husband had been giving away valuable assets that she was part-entitled to, including the £5m he handed to the Labour Party.<br><br>During the bitter legal clash, she told a judge that Mr Vince regularly travelled by private jet, drank Dom Perignon champagne, sailed in a luxury yacht and drove powerful, petrol-guzzling cars.<br><br>After the ruling, Mr Vince complained he had been the victim of a “character assassination”.<br><br>He founded Ecotricity 30 years ago and now controls a business empire that also spans lab-grown diamond company Skydiamond and the Forest Green Rovers, a vegan football club.<br><br>His group company, Green Britain Group, slumped to a £7m loss in the year to April partly owing to a £12m writedown on Ecotricity’s green gas mill in Reading.</p></body></html>
