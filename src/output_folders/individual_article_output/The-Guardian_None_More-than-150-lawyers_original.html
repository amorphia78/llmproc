        <h1>More than 150 lawyers and refugee NGOs report being ‘pressured into silence’ by far-right protesters</h1><p>At least two groups supporting UK asylum seekers have closed their offices after credible threats to their safety<br><br>More than 150 lawyers, human rights, refugee and environmental organisations have said they are being “pressured into silence” after some received rape and death threats from far-right and anti-migrant protesters.<br><br>At least two refugee NGOs that have been supporting asylum seekers who have received notices from the Home Office that they will be forcibly removed to France under Labour’s controversial “one in, one out” scheme have closed their offices after credible threats to their safety.<br><br>Organisations including Liberty, Greenpeace, Care4Calais, Bail for Immigration Detainees, Choose Love, the Runnymede Trust and Freedom from Torture, along with many lawyers, including KCs, have signed the statement in what they say is an act of solidarity in the face of mounting threats.<br><br>They are particularly concerned about how media and social media is fanning the flames when referencing migrants.<br><br>The statement says: “In the last few days, we have seen increased media reporting and social media attacks targeting organisations supporting migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in our community. As leaders and organisations in the migration, human rights and legal sector, we are coming together to voice our deep concern about the rise of hostility towards our organisations and the people we work with.<br><br>“We urgently call for an end to the media narrative that is stoking the flames of division. Journalists and media outlets have a duty to act responsibly and with integrity, especially when it comes to their reporting, headlines and social media output.”</p>

    <p>Personal details of some members of staff at NGOs have been shared online, while threatening comments include: “These liberal idiots literally won’t get it until they get raped or stabbed.”<br><br>“Whilst I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, the odds are one day she, or her family will meet the reality of ‘enrichment’ in person,” thought to be a reference to rape, is another message recently received.<br><br>The joint statement adds: “These attacks are not just words on a page – they have consequences. Communities are living in fear, our staff and volunteers are receiving abuse, and our offices are being targeted.<br><br>“The migration sector, already struggling with scarce resources, is now being forced to operate quietly, fearing that visibility will bring abuse or even physical danger. The result is a chilling effect: we’re being pressured into silence, unable to speak publicly about the injustices we witness every day.”<br><br>The profound concern about the direction of travel in terms of racism and hatred of migrants follows reports of some NGOs using safe rooms in the case of far-right attacks on their premises, some feeling forced to relocate their offices and credible death threats.<br><br>A spokesperson from Bail for Immigration Detainees said: “Recent attacks only highlight the importance of work ensuring access to justice and protecting the rights of people who need it most. Despite attempts to intimidate or harass organisations standing up for fundamental rights and the rule of law, we know that we are stronger together as a community. This has strengthened our resolve to continue the vital work we do.”</p></body></html>
