    <p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil protesters disrupted the wedding of billionaire Duke of Westminster Hugh Grosvenor at Chester Cathedral by releasing orange smoke/powder paint near the entrance as the couple left the ceremony. The protesters were Polly (73, care worker from Norfolk) and Sheila (69, former NHS nurse from Bristol) who were arrested on public order offences. They demanded action to stop oil and gas, criticizing extreme wealth while billions suffer from climate crisis.</p>

    <p><br><br>SECONDARY: None mentioned.<br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article focuses heavily on the high-profile wedding itself, featuring Prince William as usher, Princess Eugenie as guest, and the Duke&#x27;s £10.42 billion wealth and connections to Prince George and Prince Archie.<br><br>TONE: The article takes a negative tone toward the protest, describing protesters as &quot;irritating&quot; in the headline and emphasizing how they tried to &quot;spoil&quot; the wedding.</p>
