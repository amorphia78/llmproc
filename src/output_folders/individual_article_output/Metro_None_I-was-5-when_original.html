    <p>Before the fire, my childhood memories are good ones.<br><br>Balancing planks of wood on bricks to make ramps to jump over on my bike. Playing with bugs in the garden. Falling asleep looking at the planes hanging from my bedroom ceiling, floating against my cloud wall-paper.<br><br>And all with my little brother Lee by my side. He was two years younger than me but we were constant companions. We slept in the same room, in bunk beds, so I’m not exaggerating when I say we were never apart. Inseparable.<br><br>Then one night, when I was five and Lee was three, we both woke up in the middle of the night, thinking we’d heard a noise in the house.<br><br>Creeping downstairs, we couldn’t see anything. Apart from a box of matches on the arm of the sofa.<br><br>We’d never seen anything like that before, not just lying around. Picking them up, Lee and I started to strike them alight, then throw them into the wicker waste paper bin. They all blew out as they whizzed through the air.<br><br>Until one didn’t.<br><br>And as it landed in the straw bin, it set it alight.<br><br>Panicking, Lee and I ran into the kitchen to fill a saucepan with water. Watching it gradually, gradually fill, it seemed to take forever. And by the time there was enough in there, the fire had spread. Our water barely dented the flames, which were now spreading across the living room.<br><br>Running to the front door, I tried the handle but it was locked.<br><br>Barely thinking, we dashed upstairs, into Mum’s bedroom. We tried to get out of her window, but Lee couldn’t reach. ‘I’ll go and get the bunk bed ladders,’ he shouted, already out of the door before I could stop him.<br><br>Just then, I saw a man on the pavement. ‘Help, there’s a fire!’ I screamed. ‘Jump!’ he shouted back, holding his arms. ‘I’ll catch you!’<br><br>‘My brother’s in here too!’ I yelled. But he didn’t hear me. Just shouted again and again for me to jump. So I did, landing heavily, clumsily, but safely, in his arms.<br><br>‘You have to save my brother!’ I shouted.<br><br>I barely remember the road filling with people, or the ambulance arriving. I just remember being carried into the back of it and seeing Lee already lying there, his tiny body still. Firefighters had found him, wrapped up in bed.<br><br>I was taken to hospital, eventually released into my grandparent’s care, then within months, I was fostered.<br><br>It was like I was living in a dream, hardly conscious of what was going on around me and although my grandparents and foster parents were incredible, I felt so alone.<br><br>I just wanted life to go back to the way it had been.<br><br>But it didn’t. Lee was buried and my mum, devastated and distressed, couldn’t care for me in the aftermath.<br><br>As a young child, with no access to help, I couldn’t express any of my sorrow or confusion or guilt over what had happened.<br><br>Not only was I blaming myself for my brother’s death, I was having horrific nightmares about the fire.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.

    <p>That entirely changed my life.<br><br>As I drifted in and out of my daze, I realised I was being put in a box. As well as the trauma I was going through, I was also dyslexic, leaving me struggling in school.<br><br>People told me I’d probably end up collecting rubbish for a living.<br><br>Over time, though, I discovered a love of art and creating things. It was a way of expressing myself practically in a way that I couldn’t verbally.<br><br>In 2001 I did a B-tech, then immediately after, a degree in graphic design.<br><br>But even there, me and my classmates were warned of the failure rate – of how few of us would succeed in getting a career we wanted and enjoyed.<br><br>I couldn’t bear these limitations people were putting on me, on all of us. But in a way, they probably made me even more determined to strive, to reach my potential.<br><br>And that was exactly what I did.<br><br>In 2006, I got a job with my idol, Ian Swift, a graphic designer. He taught me so much that I finally felt confident enough to start my own business.<br><br>I met a partner, moved to Canada, had children… all things people had taught me I’d never achieve.<br><br>In 2007, I started creating art out of greeting cards. Items that were sent with, and full of, love but were often discarded or destined for the rubbish. I loved recycling these letters, such an old-fashioned medium of showing affection, into colourful collages that sang with beauty.<br><br>When I was in my 40s, I returned to my brother’s grave for the first time since I was 21, and it was a heartbreaking, heart-wrenching experience.<br><br>I thought I had come to terms to my past, or at least accepted it in some way.<br><br>But when I returned, over 20 years later, all of the old emotions of guilt and trauma reared up again inside of me.<br><br>Rather than pushing them down or trying to block them out, for the first time, I tried therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder.<br><br>Of my favourite quotes is ‘the cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek’. And that sums up, exactly, what therapy was like for me.<br><br>I’d spent my whole life scared to talk about the night of the fire but now I finally allowed myself to open up, it helped soothe me.<br><br>I finally felt settled, at peace within myself. And at peace with Lee, allowing me to grieve him freely, without guilt.<br><br>Now, I can finally acknowledge that that night, no matter how horrific and horrendous, has made me the person I am today.<br><br>The man who defies expectations and limitations. The dad who does everything with his power for his three children. The artist who wants – and who is – making a difference to the world.<br><br>Usain Bolt, Bryan Adams, Thandiwe Newton, amongst other A-listers, have all bought pieces of my art. I have recently held an exhibition at Quantus Gallery in London and my work is currently being shown at The Grove Gallery.<br><br>These are things I once thought would never be possible – because people told me so.<br><br>And even now, I have to pinch myself that, after such a tragic, terrible start to life, this is now my life.<br><br>To view Robi’s ‘A Nation of Millions’ visit Grove Gallery, 156 New Cavendish Street, London, W1W 6YW or www.grovegallery.com<br><br>As told to Sarah Whiteley<br><br>Do you have a story you’d like to share?
