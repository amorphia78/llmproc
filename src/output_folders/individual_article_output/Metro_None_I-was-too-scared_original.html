    <p>Stepping through the front door, my son rushed to see me. ‘Hi,’ I beamed, showing off my new sparkly, shiny teeth.<br><br>‘Wow, Dad, you look amazing,’ he gasped. And I had to admit, I felt pretty amazing too.<br><br>For his whole life, I had been his dad with the decaying teeth. I’d spent decades covering my mouth with my hands, being too embarrassed to smile properly and being painfully self-conscious during conversations.<br><br>But finally, after dental surgery, I have the perfect smile.<br><br>As a child, I brushed my teeth regularly although admittedly, not as much as I should have. And whenever I went to the dentist for a routine check-up, I always needed teeth removed.<br><br>The problems continued into adulthood and, as I needed more work done, I developed a fear of the dentist, which only worsened during my 20s and 30s.<br><br>My teeth became discoloured, chipped – a lot of them fell out.<br><br>At the time, I was working as a team leader, managing nine men, communicating constantly with them, sometimes giving presentations.<br><br>I found myself covering my mouth when I spoke to people to hide my teeth.<br><br>I started avoiding close-up conversations whenever I could and making phone calls instead of speaking to people in person.<br><br>Whenever I did have to speak to someone, I’d talk with my head down and would never smile.<br><br>I went from being a natural communicator with a loud personality, to someone who’d hide away any chance they could.<br><br>And it wasn’t just in work. My teeth even began affecting my social life. I was self-conscious wherever I went out. Photographs were a total no-go for me. I kept my circle small and close but even then, I was anxious people were judging me.<br><br>I became ashamed of myself, not just my teeth. I thought people must think I wasn’t looking after them, but it was quite the opposite. I was desperately trying to find a solution.<br><br>First, I tried dentures. But they never fitted right and would shift around a lot. They also restricted my diet, as I had to consider what I could – and couldn’t – eat.<br><br>I remember once chewing a toffee and the dentures fell right out of my mouth. I was mortified. Even Christmas dinner with my family was ruined, when my turkey got stuck in them.<br><br>The dentures rubbed against my gums too, which caused painful ulcers.<br><br>I couldn’t seek any help either, as my general dislike of the dentist had evolved into a full-on fear.<br><br>I’d delay appointments as much as I could, and when I did go, I’d stay in my car and ask the receptionist to phone me when it was time for me because I couldn’t face the anxiety of the waiting room.<br><br>Then, when Covid-19 hit, I went three years without a dentist appointment and, when I was 33, my teeth crumbled. All of the places holding my dentures in place chipped and broke away. I went through 20 repair kits, none of them worked.<br><br>I was embarrassed I’d let things get this bad and knew I needed to find a solution, or I may never open my mouth again.<br><br>After researching I found dental implants, which is a titanium screw that’s placed directly into your jawbone, replacing your missing tooth root, to which a replacement tooth is attached. I felt like it was my only option. A final solution to my dental worries.<br><br>I started Googling and discovered a lot of people talking about procedures in Turkey. Some of the UK dental surgeries were charging £49,000 and the process would take months. Going to Turkey seemed like the quicker and cheaper option.<br><br>It was tempting and I even went so far as to book my ticket for £379, but the day before I was due to fly, I got cold feet.<br><br>Being in a foreign country, with a language barrier, during the one surgery I hoped would change my life, felt too much – especially with my fear of dentists. So I found myself back at square one.</p>

    <p>Then, after another 18 months of research, I found 21D, a private dental implants clinic in the UK, who quoted me £16,995 for both jaws.<br><br>The staff were so professional, talking me through the whole process. Plus, they could do the implants within the same day.<br><br>My surgery was booked for September 2023 and for the first time in my life, I couldn’t wait for that dentist appointment to arrive.<br><br>I arrived at 11am, they took my blood pressure and the dentist explained the surgery would take two hours. I couldn’t believe that soon I would be walking out of that clinic a new man.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
