    <p>Taylor Swift has touched down in the UK and we’re in the grip of Swiftie fever, with fans accidentally triggering earthquake monitors in Edinburgh, and Liverpool being renamed Taylor Town. This Friday, she finally begins her run of eight shows at London’s Wembley Stadium.<br><br>The megastar’s Eras Tour first arrived on the continent last month in Paris – and I got the golden ticket.<br><br>As I listened to her surprise song choice (Paris, obviously) it was the realisation of a long-term dream come true.<br><br>I saw Taylor perform at La Défense Arena – which will soon be playing host to the Olympics and Paralympics. It’s been estimated that 16,000,000 people could visit the French capital between July and September, and La Défense Arena is just one of the 35 venues hosting the events.<br><br>As the home for the hotly anticipated swimming events and water polo finals, it promises to be a major hub for the games.<br><br>A western suburb of Paris (about seven miles from Notre Dame), La Défense isn’t exactly known for being a tourist hotspot – think of it as the Canary Wharf of the city of love. But with so many expected to descend on the area for the games, it’s certainly its time to shine.<br><br>After all, if La Défense can handle an army of Swifties, a few sports fans should be no problem.<br><br>While living out my Swiftie dreams, I explored the area to give you the low down on all there is to see and do in La Défense.<br><br>A purpose-built business district, La Défense is full of skyscrapers – a far cry from the low-rise romance of the city centre.<br><br>I arrived in Paris on Saturday night via the super convenient Eurostar from London St Pancras, so headed over to the area the following day – just a 40-minute Metro ride away.<br><br>As you might find strolling through The City of London on a weekend when all the office workers are at home, it was pretty quiet. But it meant I could enjoy a lovely sunshine walk through the residential areas near the Seine, and the public Axe de La Défense gardens that run through the centre of the district.<br><br>A commitment to green spaces is a key part of the area’s transformation project, which was launched at the end of 2021, to make La Défense ‘the first post-carbon global business district.’ Authorities in the area have committed to halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.<br><br>Another of the the objectives is to make the area greener – and the 11 acre park I walked through provided an opportunity for peace and quiet, an ideal respite if you have a busy schedule of Olympic events to watch.<br><br>There was also a great view of the Eiffel Tower and you’re in the shadow of the Grande Arche, the result of a national design competition, built in 1982 as a 20th century take on the Arc de Triomphe.<br><br>It’s certainly an impressive structure, but my only disappointment was that the observation deck is closed to visitors (as it has been, permanently, since April 2023 due to the ‘colossal operating cost’ of the building) meaning I had to make do with a view from below.<br><br>Nearby there’s the enormous Westfield Les 4 Temps, with its 238 shops, perfect if you want to escape the heat and enjoy the aircon – and the French shopping.<br><br>And, each year, the area is home to annual festivals. The Garden Parvis pop up, at the foot of the Grande Arche is described as an ‘urban oasis’ where visitors and residents can unwind, and is open until July 26. A programme of events includes DJ sets, comedy, and quizzes.<br><br>There’s also the Jazz Festival, running to June 30, which is in its 47th year. There’s a series of open-air concerts – all of which are completely free.<br><br>If you want to stay in the action during the Olympics, La Défense boasts around 2,600 hotel rooms. Most of these belong to the top-of-the-range hotel chains such as Hilton and CitizenM.<br><br>One of the big perks of the area however is how accessible it is from thecentre of Paris. Arena staff told us that 80% of attendees come via public transport, something they can determine by monitoring footfall in the nearby, spacious La Défense Metro station.<br><br>I stayed in the three star Hotel Lucien &amp; Marinette right by Gare Du Nord where the Eurostar comes in. During the Olympics, the cost of a double room comes in at €278 euros (£235) per night – more expensive than you usually expect for a hotel room in Paris considering prior the games you can get the same at the hotel for under €150 (£127) per night.<br><br>However, it’s nearly half the current price of a night in the cheapest room in the Hilton in La Défense during this period, so certainly a more affordable alternative.<br><br>The biggest plus for me was that I stayed in the heart of Paris, with easy access to all the world-famous highlights, from the Eiffel Tower to the quintessential Parisian bistros.<br><br>For all the Londoners heading to Wembley to see our girl this weekend, you’re in for a treat.<br><br>Having seen the recording of the Eras Tour on Disney+ more times than I care to admit, I was most excited to see the newly added The Tortured Poets Department section.<br><br>The crowd was on fire too – the noise from the audience just after Taylor finished Champagne Problems, which seemed to get louder and louder for at least five minutes, will be a core memory from now on. Taylor herself was so stunned, she took off her earpiece to her us roar.</p>

    <p>Ready For It, Paris? Taylor Swift taking the stage during the Eras Tour in Paris (Picture: TAS Rights Management)<br><br>I clocked about half way through that Travis Kelce was in attendance when she strutted out in her yellow and red 1989 outfit – a not-so-subtle nod to the Kansas City Chiefs – which only served as a reminder that this was truly a special show.<br><br>How three hours passed I wasn’t sure, but soon enough the Karma confetti came down and the show came to an end.<br><br>Okay, let’s state the obvious, from neighbourhood restaurants to Michelin eateries, you’re spoilt for choice for food in Paris.<br><br>And no, you’re probably not going to choose La Défense for that slap up French meal. However, if you’re in the area, and you need some sustenance, there are some decent options.<br><br>La Défense actually has 150 restaurants, 40 of which are in the Westfield. I treated myself to a big lunch at the pizza restaurant directly opposite the arena called Billy Billy – an ideal spot with fantastic views of the venue and a general buzz as Taylor fans started queueing up.<br><br>I had a margherita pizza and beer while people watching. At €17 it was on the pricy side, but delicious all the same.<br><br>I also enjoyed an afternoon meal at Italian restaurant Noccio. My cacio e pepe was deliciously washed down with a large glass of their French Bordeaux – while also not cheap at more than €20 per dish, it was the perfect treat to end my trip before getting my train home.<br><br>If you’re watching the swimming events this summer at the Olympics, this is where you’ll be spending most of your time.<br><br>Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour was the arena’s biggest event yet, since its grand opening in 2017 with an increased capacity of 45,000. It is Europe’s largest indoor arena, a fact I certainly appreciated when the heavens opened on the way to the venue.<br><br>Swifties will know well that Taylor is no stranger to a good rain show, but I was keen for a dry concert experience.<br><br>We would later be told that the arena was built especially for a quick and easy mass departure to avoid overcrowding, with exits placed all around the venue. The venue aims for crowds to empty out in between 20-30 minutes.<br><br>Leaving did seem very speedy and efficient, with the arena looking very empty even minutes after Taylor ended. I couldn’t help but compare it to my experience two years ago seeing Red Hot Chili Peppers at Stade de France where it took about an hour to filter through the crowds and police barriers – at La Défense, the exit strategy seemed far more optimised.<br><br>The next day I was back at the arena as the Eras stage came down. The Olympic organisers got the keys to the venue on May 15, and we were given an insight into how it will be transformed for the games.<br><br>Between the Eras Tour and the start of the games on 27 July, two enormous, 2.3m deep swimming pools were built with a curtain to separate them. If on track, the completion date for these is this week, ahead of test events on 25 June, a remarkably quick turnaround.<br><br>It was hard to imagine there would be two Olympic swimming pools where I’d just seen Taylor wow the crowds with Cruel Summer.<br><br>But staff there assured me the venue was versatile – used to switching between tours by icons like the Rolling Stones and P!nk, as well as key sporting events.<br><br>I’ll be frank, if you’re coming to Paris to find the pièce de résistance of Parisian culture, then La Défense is not it.<br><br>But is it built to effectively host, entertain and feed the millions descending on the French capital this summer? 100% yes. If you’re watching the Olympics then there is plenty to see and do in La Défense to keep you occupied.<br><br>Set sail to the Mediterranean in 2025 – here&#x27;s all you need to know<br><br>Private beach clubs, Art Deco delights and the world’s second-largest reef on the ultimate Caribbean cruise<br><br>Top 10 travel brands you need to know about for tour next adventure<br><br>British Airways launches new Italian routes from London – including ‘underrated’ spot<br><br>UK airport to bring back popular long-haul routes after 14 year absence<br><br>What’s more, because of how easy it is to get to from the centre of the city, you can have the traditional tourist experience of Paris amidst watching the games.
