    <p>There were unexpected echoes of the comedy rockers Spinal Tap as the songwriter Tamara Lindeman brought her meditative chamber-pop project, the Weather Station, to Dublin’s Button Factory. The earnest Toronto musician and her band were flanked by three huge menhir-like structures seemingly made from vast quantities of papier-mâché. These brought to mind the fake Stonehenge from Rob Reiner’s satirical rockumentary, though, in Lindeman’s case, the props appeared to symbolise nature’s stoicism in the face of human destruction. There were none of This Is Spinal Tap’s dancing dwarfs and that was probably for the best.<br><br>Lindeman isn’t the first Canadian to pour her trauma about the state of the planet into music, as she did on her acclaimed 2021 album Ignorance and the recent follow-up Humanhood. Joni Mitchell got there first with Big Yellow Taxi, her righteous tirade against urban development, while Neil Young has long raged against the evils of corporate America.<br><br>But the Weather Station’s songs were more abstract and a good deal less preachy than most eco-rock throughout an agreeably dark and stormy concert. Arriving to an instrumental from her musically adventurous ensemble — saxophone and flute solos abounded — the former teen actress plunged into the chilly Wear. Surreal imagery (“I tried to wear the world like some kinda garment”) and twitchy piano conjured an intense dread, the widespread response of many of Lindeman’s fellow millennials when thinking about challenges confronting humanity.</p>

    <p>With her sharp fringe and a voice that rose from the depths, Lindeman bore a superficial resemblance to the tragic Velvet Underground collaborator Nico, if she’d been massively into Greenpeace rather than heroin. As a conscientious Canadian, Lindeman also surely has opinions on Donald Trump’s designs on her country.<br><br>But this gripping show, which blended emotion-shredding balladry, artisanal jazz and ominous art-rock, was too sophisticated for a crude anti-Trump rant. Instead, the glitchy menace of Radiohead’s Kid A rippled through Neon Signs, a single from Humanhood. There were also some gorgeous pop moments, with Parking Lot and the closing torch song Sewing together suggesting a goth Fleetwood Mac. As Leonard Cohen famously observed, it’s the crack that lets the light in — and for all that it evoked mankind’s warped relationship with nature, this performance was an ultimately uplifting affair.★★★★☆St Luke’s, Glasgow, Mar 10, touring to Mar 13, theweatherstation.net<br><br>Follow @timesculture to read the latest reviews</p>
