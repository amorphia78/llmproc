    <p>A group calling itself People Demand Democracy later claimed that the protester had acted on its behalf.<br><br>In a statement, it said: &quot;During Keir Starmer&#x27;s Labour Party Conference speech this afternoon, a single demonstrator climbed on the stage and temporarily stopped the speech. The individual covered Starmer in glitter and wore a t-shirt saying &#x27;People Demand Democracy&#x27;.<br><br>&quot;People Demand Democracy is a new group calling for an upgrade to the UK political system using civil disobedience to get their message across. They are calling for a fair, proportional voting system for Westminster elections and a permanent, legally-binding national House of Citizens, selected by democratic lottery.&quot;<br><br>Click to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts<br><br>It said the protester, who it didn&#x27;t name, said: &quot;The Labour Party has been captured, donors and lobbyists have more control over Keir Starmer than his members.
