        <h1>Labour’s Richard Parker defeats Andy Street in tight West Midlands mayoral race after Sadiq Khan wins third term in London – as it happened</h1><p>Labour has secured mayoral victories in London, Greater Manchester, Salford, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and Liverpool today<br><br>Sadiq Khan is officially declared the winner in the London mayoral election with 1,088,225 votes, a majority of 276,707.<br><br>Here is some reaction to Sadiq Khan winning a historic third term and the other mayoral races.<br><br>Shirley Rodrigues, deputy mayor for environment and energy in London, wrote on X: “I’m back! And what a fantastic result - tackling the climate and ecological emergencies &amp; air pollution is the right thing to do! It was #ULEZ wot won it!”<br><br>Mel Evans, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, said: “Sadiq Khan’s win with an even bigger majority confirms the clear message from this election: bold climate and environmental action is a vote-winner. Anti-green populism has largely backfired at the ballot box.<br><br>“Many of the local and mayoral candidates that stood on bold green policy platforms won resounding victories. The people of London, Bristol, Manchester, Liverpool and the North East all elected mayors and councillors who have committed to boosting public transport, delivering green growth and cutting emissions. As Labour continues its resurgence to power, the gains made in these local elections demonstrate, once again, that the British public overwhelmingly support climate action.”<br><br>Neal Lawson, director of the campaign group Compass, said:<br><br>“We should celebrate the alliance of progressive voters uniting behind Sadiq Khan, but forcing people to vote Labour just to keep the right out is driving distrust, alienation, and short-termism in our politics. That’s the reality under first past the post.<br><br>“Under a more democratic system, we could still keep the right out without alienating voters and perpetuating democratic injustices.”<br><br>The results in the West Midlands mayoral election look set for a nail-biting finale, as it has just been announced a full recount is taking place in Coventry, one of the seven local authorities which make up the combined authority area.<br><br>This is apparently going to take another two hours, meaning we could be well into the evening before we get a result. It was due to be announced at about 3pm.<br><br>When it comes, it is bound to be incredibly close between the Conservative’s Andy Street and his Labour rival, Richard Parker.<br><br>Sadiq Khan has been elected mayor of London, winning a historic third term in a dramatic contest.<br><br>Khan was declared the winner on Saturday afternoon with the Conservative candidate Susan Hall finishing second.<br><br>The London mayor had described the battle as a “close two-horse race” when polls predicted he had a 25-point lead over his Tory rival, in what appeared to be an effort to encourage Labour loyalists and more apathetic Londoners to vote.</p>
