    <p>Farmers in Surrey say they are furious after a legal ruling gave the go-ahead to a gas drilling project.<br><br>The Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal against a government decision allowing UK Oil &amp; Gas (UKOG) to explore a site in Dunsfold.<br><br>Ashley Herman, who lives near the site, said the disruption to traffic, local businesses and the environment were not in proportion to potential benefits.<br><br>UKOG said the project would benefit energy and economic interests.<br><br>The application from the energy company had been approved by the government, despite it twice being refused by Surrey County Council.<br><br>Mr Herman raised concerns the access to the site.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s rolling hills and beautiful countryside, and has small, little lanes and sunken roads,&quot; he told BBC Radio Surrey.<br><br>&quot;It is so narrow, you can probably just about fit a bin lorry down it. I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re going to access this site at all.&quot;<br><br>He said the entire village had worked together to try to prevent the project.<br><br>&quot;The mood here is absolutely furious,&quot; he said. &quot;The disruption it is going to cause to the village and to the people who live around the site will be enormous and out of proportion to any potential benefits.&quot;</p>

    <p>Kirsty Cluff, a campaigner from Extinction Rebellion and the Weald Action Group, said the decision was unbeneficial to the climate emergency.<br><br>&quot;It was the hottest year on record last year. Climate change is happening now, and burning fossil fuels is by far the biggest contributor,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;This is not justice for the people, for the climate or the environment.&quot;<br><br>UKOG said it would be able to extract gas from the Dunsfold site worth Â£123m.<br><br>&quot;We are pleased that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has once again dismissed the legal challenge to our Loxley project and has confirmed that its planning consent is entirely lawful, as the company and its counsel has maintained,&quot; a spokesperson said.<br><br>The firm also said the project was in keeping with the government&#x27;s Hydrogen, Energy Security and Net Zero strategies.<br><br>On Tuesday, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said he was &quot;bitterly disappointed&quot; in the decision that gave the go-ahead to the project in his South West Surrey constituency.<br><br>Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.
