    <p>‘The villain in The Marvels’ diabolical plan involves robbing entire planets of their atmosphere: perhaps if she’d wanted to speed things up, she could have screened the film there instead.’<br><br>In a biting one-star review in The Telegraph, renowned film critic Robbie Collin joined a league of disappointed audiences responding to Marvel’s latest flop, The Marvels.<br><br>It just proves that, regrettably, this ‘unrelievedly bland’ (according to the New York Times) sequel is another misfire in a long line of recent bombs – and it’s time for Marvel to stop.<br><br>When you examine the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2023, the phrase from ‘hero to zero’ has never been more apt.<br><br>It’s hard to believe that, only a few years ago, the franchise was riding high. Avengers: Endgame was the highest-grossing film of all time, and – thanks to Marvel – superheroes were a credible force in the cultural zeitgeist.<br><br>Up Next<br><br>I remember being pleasantly surprised by the panache and humour of Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man (2008), which was the very first MCU film. Then, as a huge Parks and Recreation fan, I was thrilled that Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) had given Chris Pratt the part of a lifetime in Peter Quill. Seeing Black Panther (2018) for the first time, I was amazed by the richness and complexity of the world the filmmakers had created.<br><br>But gone are the days when the latter was taking a billion dollars at the box office. For me, Marvel has been dead in the water for a long time.<br><br>While everyone around me seemed enraptured by Avengers: Infinity War, I despaired over a never-ending list of sequels, spin-offs and thinly connected characters. I laughed at the idea that an intergalactic warlord who resembled an aubergine emoji (Thanos) was being celebrated as one of cinema’s greatest villains.<br><br>Then, just two years ago, I wrote an article criticising Marvel’s lacklustre Eternals (2021), and I vowed to never watch another Marvel offering again. I’ve kept to my vow, and I continue to lament the MCU’s domination of the box office with its repetitive storytelling, characters, and overreliance on CGI.<br><br>To me, these films were devoid of any artistry, complexity, and original vision. They were conceived to follow a formula and simply to fulfil a quota.<br><br>Many people argued that Eternals was merely a ‘blip’ (which gives an unfortunate flashback to our friend Thanos from The Avengers and his ridiculous bejewelled glove wiping out the universe). But Marvel is now just a constant cycle of diminishing returns, and it’s hardly surprising because a true cultural phenomenon is not something that can be endlessly replicated and recycled.<br><br>That same year, audiences went wild for Spider-Man: No Way Home. As someone who loves Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man (and Willem Dafoe’s devilishly campy Green Goblin), I should have been thrilled at this, alongside former incarnations of Spider-Man Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield being reunited on the big screen.<br><br>But to me, it was utterly cringe-worthy. In the absence of inventive storytelling and original characters, why does Marvel consistently resort to empty gimmicks and nostalgia?<br><br>I should note that I didn’t see it, but I’ve watched the clips online. Social media exploded at the time and the gimmick twist was all anyone could talk about.<br><br>Since then, we’ve had the ‘incredibly tired’ and ‘genuinely properly terrible’ (according to famed critic Mark Kermode) Thor: Love and Thunder. A film apparently so over-stuffed with gags and goofs, it was likened to being hit over the head with Thor’s hammer.<br><br>This was followed by the ‘baffling and illogical’ (so says The Guardian) Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Marvel’s most poorly-reviewed film to date, Ant-Man racked up only 46% on the cinema aggregate Rotten Tomatoes.<br><br>And now The Marvels, the MCU’s latest offering, is expected to end its theatrical run with up to $240million (£191million) at the global box office, which is under its $270million (£215million) budget – making it the lowest total ever for a Marvel film.<br><br>But with 33 Marvel films to date and another 10 in development, it feels like a cinematic universe that simply won’t die.<br><br>Worse still, the MCU isn’t just happy steamrolling audiences in the cinema. Their takeover of the TV streaming service Disney+ is another nail in its decaying coffin, with star-led empty vessels like Secret Invasion, the aimless She-Hulk: Attorney at Law and an ‘ill-advised’ (wrote The Independent) anti-hero spinoff in Loki, season two.<br><br>Now, even Disney CEO Bob Iger is tired of entertainment’s most unrelenting machine diluting audiences ‘focus and attention’.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.</p>

She says she was overwhelmed by the strength of the nicotine pouch and now has a warning for parents.<br><br>I’ll admit, as someone who has long tired of the mediocrity of Marvel, I’m delighted. While the prolific author Stephen King has criticised people online for ‘gloating’ over The Marvels’ low box-office numbers, I believe there are countless reasons to celebrate what I hope will be Marvel’s demise.<br><br>We don’t need any more remakes, reboots or relaunches. And, after 15 years, it’s time the MCU was stopped in its tracks.<br><br>There’s a reason why – 30 years on – I still feel a shiver down my spine the first time Sam Neill and Laura Dern see a live dinosaur in Jurassic Park, or I re-watch Titanic and my heart soars as Rose cries, ‘I’m flying, Jack!’ at the bow of the ship.<br><br>These are rare and precious moments in film history when the stars seem to align – everything is perfectly matched from the acting, to the cinematography, the score, the story. As a viewer, you are truly transported and immersed in a world beyond comprehension.<br><br>It’s a feat that the Marvel formula simply cannot match, so when will Marvel executives, producers and fans finally realise this?<br><br>Up Next<br><br>But it seems that, for many, the MCU is dangerously immune from criticism.<br><br>Following my article about Eternals, I was tracked down by toxic male trolls on social media. I was called ‘f***ing stupid’ and a ‘fart personified’ (admittedly a creative insult) simply for having an opinion on a film series.<br><br>I remain deeply concerned that something as flippant and trivial as a superhero film series can inspire such vitriol. Even award-winning filmmakers aren’t exempt.<br><br>When Martin Scorsese said in a 2019 interview that Marvel films were ‘not cinema’, the internet exploded.<br><br>Then just last month, Avengers director Joe Russo mocked the famed director for his remarks, boasting about his own box office success compared with Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon.

There are also rumours Robert Downey Jr could return as Iron-Man, and Pedro Pascal will star in an unwelcome remake of the Fantastic Four.<br><br>I routinely see anguished articles and comments online asking how Marvel can be ‘saved’, with fans calling for Iron-Man’s return, as well as the introduction of a new super-villain, such as Doctor Doom, to spice things up.<br><br>I’m rarely proven right, and while my premonition from two years ago is coming true, I’m not looking to laud Marvel’s failure. These films have brought genuine enjoyment to many, but I truly believe there is better non-superhero content coming.<br><br>The ‘multiverse’ couldn’t last forever, and its declining popularity has given the box office room to breathe, encouraging audiences to focus on uniquely brilliant films such as Past Lives or The Menu instead.<br><br>The best is certainly not yet to come, so please Marvel, quit while you’re ahead.<br><br>Cineworld is going all out for the release of Wicked, and we couldn’t be more excited<br><br>It’s time for the world to finally say goodbye to the multiverse.<br><br>Do you have a story you’d like to share?
