    <p>On a solo masturbation session a few months ago, I was after porn for convenience, not excitement.<br><br>So after scrolling through a popular website, I settled on a generic video of a straight couple shagging in a bed with crumpled white sheets.<br><br>It was a quick and easy orgasm, not an attempt to broaden my horizons or explore a new kink.<br><br>I like adventurous sex as much as the next person but I’ve found that, as a woman, it’s often ‘safer’ to stick to the basics (a cis couple having fairly ordinary sex) when it comes to mainstream sites.<br><br>It means I can avoid spending time having to pause or skip past the grim scenes that dominate a lot of male-focused content, whether it’s women gagging with mascara running down their faces, or the mind-numbing penetration shots.<br><br>I don’t judge anyone’s preferences, but let’s be honest and admit that most is made from a man’s point of view.<br><br>As a female friend recently told me: ‘I like watching X-rated films but I struggle to find anything created with women in mind, which puts me off.’<br><br>I get it – I used to believe porn was just for men. But I’ve gradually changed my tune and I hope that, by reading this, you will too, and might even be inspired to watch some dirty films yourself.<br><br>When younger, I felt detached from this type of entertainment because no women I knew admitted to watching X-rated content, and most of what I heard and read was seedy endorsements from men, or horror stories from the actors who took part – so it didn’t occur to me that I might get pleasure from it.<br><br>Love reading juicy stories like this?

We can&#x27;t wait for you to join us!<br><br>My first encounter with adult entertainment was jarring, to say the least. An ex of mine put on a gang bang film during sex and I was horrified from the moment he pressed play. It would be many years before I watched porn again.<br><br>But thanks to more women taking charge behind the camera in recent years, it’s now far easier to find good stuff aimed at a female audience.<br><br>And it has spurred on a revolution in the industry, and for me personally.<br><br>In my late 20s, struggling with my sex drive due to anxiety and stress, and fed up with men having all the fun, I decided it was time to mix things up, and use porn to try and reclaim that sense of pleasure – it was a smashing success.<br><br>But I can’t deny there was also a strange sense of shame lingering in the background after I’d climaxed.<br><br>Logically, I knew I’d done nothing wrong by watching it but the act still felt almost dirty, and not in a good way.<br><br>It took a few more tries to truly let go and enjoy myself, scrolling through more man-focussed videos to find what I liked.<br><br>I felt a buzz, like I’d opened a new door to my own pleasure, and it was exciting to keep discovering new things I enjoyed (like using sex toys while watching or choosing a film to later watch with a partner).<br><br>Curious to hear from other women, I recently conducted a mini-poll on Twitter,  and the results were surprising.<br><br>Of the 200 who replied, nearly a third said they don’t watch porn, 34.5% said they do so ‘rarely’, while one in 20 feel ‘intimidated’ by the idea.<br><br>To these women, I say: while it may not seem like it was created for us, things have changed.<br><br>But it helps to know what to look for, so here are a few tips.<br><br>Firstly, some experts recommend paying for your adult content and ditching sites that rely on ads, so you can get a more tailored approach rather than the broad brushes of mainstream sites.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.

She says she was overwhelmed by the strength of the nicotine pouch and now has a warning for parents.<br><br>It can also be more ethical, as you know performers are consenting and have been properly compensated.<br><br>There are also many sites that focus purely on feminist porn, like FrolicMe or Erika Lust, to name but two.<br><br>You’ll notice that much of the content found on these female-friendly sites focus less on the cheesy scenarios and relentless banging you may be used to seeing, and more on connection and touch, as well as women being the instigators of sex.<br><br>You could even scroll through OnlyFans, where creators are empowered to make their own money and you could get personalised content, if that’s your thing.<br><br>But not everyone can afford to pay for this pleasure.<br><br>If you’re using more mainstream sites, the search bar, rather than the homepage, is your friend – and I often find myself using terms like ‘romantic’ to get a somewhat softer video.<br><br>I know people – myself included – sometimes struggle to actually rationalise what turns us on.<br><br>But take it from someone who has interviewed people about everything from watersports (it involves urine) to penis humiliation – we all have our fantasies.<br><br>Porn is a great way for you to discover new kinks, if you’re brave enough to try.<br><br>I won’t share specifics but my own viewing has changed over the years.

If you come across something illegal or a film you deem unsafe, please report it.<br><br>Nevertheless, despite these issues, remember that you are still allowed to enjoy watching other people enjoy each other, no matter what form that takes.<br><br>While this column is about watching porn alone, that doesn’t mean it can’t have an impact with your partner – watching X-rated movies alone can also be a great form of foreplay. Get yourself randy and then use this ‘charged’ energy to seduce your other half.<br><br>As for myself, these days, I treat porn as a way to enhance my sex life, not an everyday occurrence.<br><br>That old feeling of shame is rare. If it does pop up, I promptly remind myself that I’m allowed pleasure, in whatever shape it comes.<br><br>And so are you.<br><br>Happy watching.<br><br>Do you have a story you’d like to share?
