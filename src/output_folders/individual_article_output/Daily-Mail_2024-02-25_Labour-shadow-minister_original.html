    <p>Labour&#x27;s Lisa Nandy today revealed she carries a police alarm &#x27;everywhere I go&#x27; amid growing fears for MPs&#x27; safety.<br><br>The shadow international development minister spoke of how she has &#x27;security on my home&#x27; and now only sees constituents &#x27;by appointment&#x27;.<br><br>She described this as a &#x27;very typical experience&#x27; for MPs at a time when British politicians are receiving threats &#x27;on multiple issues in multiple directions&#x27;.<br><br>Ms Nandy&#x27;s disclosure of her personal security measures comes after it was revealed three unnamed female MPs have been given taxpayer-funded bodyguards and cars.<br><br>Concerns about MPs&#x27; safety have grown amid widespread protests over the conflict in Gaza following the Hamas terror attacks and Israel&#x27;s bloody military response.<br><br>Just Stop Oil has also been condemned for recently calling for MPs to be targeted by climate campaigners at their offices and homes.<br><br>The House of Commons descended into chaos on Wednesday night when Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle tore up convention over a vote on calls for a Middle East ceasefire.<br><br>He said his concern about the security of MPs had played a part in his decision to break with precedent on the issue.<br><br>Speaking to Times Radio this morning, Ms Nandy described how she no longer does &#x27;publicly advertised&#x27; constituency surgeries but does them &#x27;by appointment&#x27; instead.<br><br>&#x27;We have security present. I carry a police alarm everywhere that I go. I have security on my home,&#x27; she said. &#x27;And that is a really very typical experience for MPs.&#x27;<br><br>She added: &#x27;I went to a party meeting just last week and had people gathering around the entrance of that, shouting &quot;genocide&quot; and accusing me and others of committing genocide.<br><br>&#x27;We&#x27;ve had a couple of senior members of the shadow cabinet surrounded by people as they were going about canvassing, being filmed on their phones, and very aggressive comments about their own families.<br><br>&#x27;There was the Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who had people outside of his home. And that actually isn&#x27;t an isolated incident - that&#x27;s happened to lots of MPs.&#x27;<br><br>Ms Nandy insisted that MPs &#x27;won&#x27;t stand for&#x27; threats and intimidation directed at them.<br><br>&#x27;When you threaten and intimidate us, you&#x27;re not just trying to us, you&#x27;re trying to silence people out in the country as well,&#x27; the Wigan MP added.<br><br>&#x27;And that&#x27;s unacceptable. And we won&#x27;t stand for it.&#x27;<br><br>Ms Nandy had earlier told Sky News how she thought &#x27;many MPs&#x27; will have been in touch with the Speaker to express &#x27;concerns about their safety&#x27; in recent weeks.<br><br>She described how MPs were receiving threats &#x27;on multiple issues in multiple directions&#x27;.<br><br>Just Stop Oil were recently condemned for urging climate campaigners to target Labour MPs in their homes as they protest against new oil and gas licences.</p>

    <p>It came after a Mail On Sunday investigation revealed how activists are plotting to &#x27;occupy&#x27; politicians&#x27; offices and homes ahead of the general election.<br><br>The Sunday Times today reported three female MPs, including from the Tories and Labour, have been given taxpayer-funded bodyguards and cars.<br><br>The newspaper did not name them but said they had their security upgraded following a risk assessment carried out with support from the Ravec committee, which is responsible for the security of the Royal Family and senior politicians.<br><br>The MPs were revealed to have been provided with close protection by private companies, along with chauffeur-driven cars, which are normally provided only to senior members of the cabinet and the leader of the opposition.<br><br>The security of other MPs deemed at risk was also reported to be under review.<br><br>The Sunday Telegraph reported that Sir Lindsay has written to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to seek more funding for the scheme to protect politicians by installing security measures at MPs&#x27; homes and constituency offices.<br><br>The Commons chaos on Wednesday night came after Sir Lindsay broke with precedent on an Opposition Day motion on a Gaza ceasefire tabled by the SNP.<br><br>The Speaker&#x27;s handling of events prompted a fierce backlash and sparked demands for him to resign, with 71 MPs now supporting a motion of no confidence in Sir Lindsay.<br><br>MPs are set to again debate calling for a ceasefire after the SNP said it would take up the Speaker&#x27;s offer of a  meaningful debate on a fresh ceasefire motion.<br><br>SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said his party will seek to &#x27;move the Gaza ceasefire debate forward&#x27; by tabling a motion that will press Parliament to back &#x27;concrete actions&#x27; to achieve an end to hostilities<br><br>Mr Sunak said MPs had been &#x27;verbally threatened and physically, violently targeted&#x27; in recent weeks as protests were &#x27;hijacked by extremists to promote and glorify terrorism&#x27;.<br><br>In a statement, Mr Sunak said: &#x27;The events of recent weeks are but the latest in an emerging pattern which should not be tolerated.<br><br>&#x27;Legitimate protests hijacked by extremists to promote and glorify terrorism, elected representatives verbally threatened and physically, violently targeted, and antisemitic tropes beamed onto our own Parliament building.<br><br>&#x27;And in Parliament this week a very dangerous signal was sent that this sort of intimidation works. It is toxic for our society and our politics and is an affront to the liberties and values we hold dear here in Britain.<br><br>&#x27;Our democracy cannot and must not bend to the threat of violence and intimidation or fall into polarised camps who hate each other.&#x27;</p>
