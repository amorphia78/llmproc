    <p>PRIMARY: Three Just Stop Oil protesters - Stephen Simpson (61), Phillipa Green (24), and Mary Somerville (77) - threw Heinz vegetable soup at two Van Gogh &#x27;Sunflowers&#x27; paintings at the National Gallery&#x27;s exhibition. They demanded accountability for fossil fuel executives and politicians, stating &quot;Future generations will regard these prisoners of conscience to be on the right side of history.&quot; All three were charged with criminal damage.<br><br>SECONDARY: The article extensively covers the earlier jailing of Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland for a similar soup attack on the same painting in 2022, receiving sentences totaling three years and eight months. Previous protests included activists gluing themselves to Constable&#x27;s The Hay Wain.</p>
