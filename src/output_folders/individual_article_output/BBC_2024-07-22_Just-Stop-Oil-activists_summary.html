        <h1>Just Stop Oil activists bailed</h1><p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil protesters, Jennifer Kowalski (28) and Cole Macdonald (22), are accused of using angle grinders to breach Stansted Airport&#x27;s fence and spraying two planes with orange paint using fire extinguishers. They accessed the airport at 5:00 AM on June 20th, causing an estimated Â£52,000 in cleanup costs. Both have pleaded not guilty to criminal damage and interfering with national infrastructure.</p>
