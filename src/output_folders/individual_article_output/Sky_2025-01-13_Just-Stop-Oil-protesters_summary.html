    <p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil protesters spray-painted &quot;1.5 is dead&quot; in chalk paint on Charles Darwin&#x27;s grave at Westminster Abbey at 9:30am Monday. The protesters were Alyson Lee (66, retired teaching assistant) and Di Bligh (77, former council CEO). They demand governments stop burning fossil fuels by 2030, protesting that global temperatures have passed the 1.5C threshold set by the Paris Climate Agreement.</p>
