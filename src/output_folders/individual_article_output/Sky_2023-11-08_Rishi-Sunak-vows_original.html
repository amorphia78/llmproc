        <h1>Rishi Sunak vows to hold Metropolitan Police chief 'accountable' for allowing pro-Palestinian protest on Armistice Day</h1><h2>The prime minister's comments come after Steve Barclay, the health secretary, told Sky News that 11 November was the "wrong day" for protest action in London calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. But the police say they can protect remembrance events.</h2><p>Rishi Sunak has said he will hold the chief of the Metropolitan Police &quot;accountable&quot; for allowing a pro-Palestinian demonstration to go ahead on Armistice Day.<br><br>The prime minister met Sir Mark Rowley to discuss the planned protest, which is set to go ahead on 11 November.<br><br>Sky News understands Sir Mark pulled out of a Q&amp;A event with the Institute for Government to make the meeting.<br><br>It comes a day after he resisted pressure heaped on the force by politicians to try and block the protest, which will call for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.<br><br>Politics live: Top civil servant sorry for &#x27;heartless&#x27; pandemic suggestion<br><br>Speaking during a visit to a school in Lincolnshire on Wednesday, the prime minister said: &quot;This is a decision that the Metropolitan Police commissioner has made.<br><br>&quot;He has said that he can ensure that we safeguard remembrance for the country this weekend as well as keep the public safe.<br><br>&quot;Now, my job is to hold him accountable for that.&quot;<br><br>Sir Mark said the demonstration on Saturday would go ahead because the &quot;legal threshold&quot; to stop it on security grounds &quot;had not been met&quot;.<br><br>The commissioner said people &quot;should be very reassured that we&#x27;re going to keep this away from the remembrance and armistice events&quot; - but legally, there was &quot;no mechanism to ban a gathering, a static protest&quot;.<br><br>Mr Sunak&#x27;s comments come after Steve Barclay, the health secretary, told Sky News that 11 November was the &quot;wrong day&quot; for protest action in London and &quot;there&#x27;ll be ongoing discussions on this&quot;.<br><br>Downing Street denied seeking to put pressure on the Met, which is operationally independent, insisting the meeting is about &quot;seeking assurances&quot; that their approach is &quot;robust&quot;.<br><br>By Graham Wettone, policing analyst<br><br>Sir Mark Rowley was very careful with his words about why the pro-Palestinian protest this Saturday has not been banned.<br><br>He spoke about the legal issues around banning a gathering and then explained the possible options for a ban.<br><br>He has interpreted the law correctly and some in government appear to have misunderstood or misinterpreted it, and forgotten the police have operational independence.<br><br>Section 12 of the Public Order Act 1986 allows for marches and processions to have conditions placed on them if the senior officer &quot;reasonably believes&quot; it may result in serious disorder, damage or disruption.<br><br>The Met can impose conditions relating to the duration and route of a march, as placing a number restriction is totally unworkable. That is what they will be doing with the organisers this Saturday, as the organising groups have refused to cancel the protest.<br><br>Section 13 of the Public Order Act relates to banning a march. This is only applicable if the commissioner reasonably believes that the powers under Section 12 - any conditions he imposes on the procession - will not be sufficient to prevent serious disorder.<br><br>Sir Mark clearly stated that, at the moment, the intelligence does not support the &quot;reasonable belief&quot; that serious disorder is likely, hence he cannot legally apply for a ban under Section 13. I would agree that is probably the case - but intelligence will be developing over the next few days, and the commissioner did not rule out the situation may change before Saturday.</p>

    <p>Sir Mark then explained the law around gatherings or assemblies. Police can impose conditions on these under Section 14 of Public Order Act, which is similar to Section 12 in that there needs to be a &quot;reasonable belief&quot; of &quot;serious disorder&quot;.<br><br>However a key difference is that Section 13 only applies to processions or marches under Section 12 - and not gatherings under Section 14.  There are no legal powers to ban people gathering.<br><br>The Met tried to prevent unlawful assemblies using Section 14 across London a few years ago with Just Stop Oil, but the High Court ruled it was unlawful and that gatherings cannot be legally banned.<br><br>The likely scenario as it stands is that if a ban went in for the march, the organising groups would still have people attend a &quot;gathering&quot; - and the fact a ban is in place may well increase numbers. If groups then decide to separate off in different directions, and if there are significant numbers in the thousands, then arresting all is impossible.<br><br>PM &#x27;picking a fight with police&#x27;<br><br>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said while remembrance events should be respected, &quot;the person the PM needs to hold accountable is his home secretary&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Picking a fight with the police instead of working with them is cowardice,&quot; he said on X.<br><br>Home Secretary Suella Braverman has been criticised for divisive language in recent days, including calling pro-Palestinian demonstrations &quot;hate marches&quot;.<br><br>Tens of thousands have demonstrated in London in recent weeks over Palestinian deaths in the Israel-Hamas war, with 29 arrests during a fourth week of protests last Saturday, during which fireworks were thrown.<br><br>Organisers of this Saturday&#x27;s protest say it will be &quot;well away&quot; from the Cenotaph - going from Hyde Park to the US embassy - and it won&#x27;t start until after the 11am silence.<br><br>Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player<br><br>Police chief explains why protest will go ahead<br><br>Police can ask the home secretary to approve a ban under the Public Order Act if they believe there will be serious public disorder, serious criminal damage, or serious disruption to the community.<br><br>However, Sir Mark said the use of this power is &quot;incredibly rare&quot; and must be reserved for cases where there is intelligence to suggest a &quot;real threat&quot; of trouble.<br><br>In a statement, he said: &quot;The organisers have shown complete willingness to stay away from the Cenotaph and Whitehall and have no intention of disrupting the nation&#x27;s remembrance events.<br><br>&quot;Should this change, we&#x27;ve been clear we will use powers and conditions available to us to protect locations and events of national importance at all costs.&quot;<br><br>Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player<br><br>Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was not invited to the meeting between Sir Mark and the prime minister.<br><br>But a spokesman for the senior Labour figure said he supported the protest going ahead.<br><br>&quot;The right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, and the vast majority of those protesting over the last few weeks have done so peacefully and lawfully,&quot; the mayor&#x27;s spokesman said.<br><br>&quot;Sadiq has been clear that the police will move against anyone found breaking the law, including taking strong action against anyone committing a hate crime.&quot;</p></body></html>
