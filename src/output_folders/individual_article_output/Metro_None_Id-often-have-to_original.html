    <p>Flushing the toilet, I washed my hands, then collapsed into bed, exhausted.<br><br>It was the end of another full-on day with my two children, five and two, and I couldn’t wait to finally close my eyes.<br><br>Yet, within five minutes, I was throwing back the duvet, pulling myself back to my feet, heading, once more, to the toilet.<br><br>This was just the start of my numerous night-time visits to the loo.<br><br>As someone with an overactive bladder, I can easily be up four or five times in the night, needing a wee.<br><br>Although it sounds like a small problem, or minor inconvenience, it impacts my whole life.<br><br>For as long as I can remember, I’ve gone to the toilet before I leave the house, even when I don’t need it, and checked where the toilets are whenever I go somewhere new.<br><br>But it was only in secondary school that I realised not all of my peers would need a wee every single break and lunch – then, minutes later, feel the urge in the middle of class.<br><br>I even had to walk out of a lesson on multiple occasions when the teacher said I couldn’t go. I was desperately trying not to have an accident.<br><br>My constant need to do a wee affected every single part of my life.<br><br>If I was out with friends, whether that be a long walk or even if I was caught short between pubs, I’d often have to find a quiet place to squat down. Most understood, but a few would look at me in shock.<br><br>‘Can you not just keep it in?’ they’d ask, horrified. But I couldn’t.<br><br>When I left school and did an apprenticeship in teaching, then got my first job, I worried that my bosses would think I was skiving, as I was constantly up and down to the toilet.<br><br>If I was ill or hungover, I’d have to put towels down over the bathroom floor because whenever I’d vomit, I couldn’t stop myself weeing at the same time.<br><br>It just consumed me.<br><br>The only thing it didn’t affect was my relationships with men. I always told them I needed to wee a lot and actually, I found they were generally more understanding than women. ‘It’s just going to the toilet,’ they’d shrug.<br><br>By the time I hit my early 20s, I knew this wasn’t right and went to my GP. Thankfully, they took me seriously and referred me to the urology department of my local hospital.<br><br>At first, I was just given medication and told to do pelvic floor exercises.<br><br>But when I returned after that didn’t help, a different nurse shook her head. ‘At your age, with no children, there is clearly an underlying problem. We’ll send you for tests.’ I nodded, glad they were listening.<br><br>These tests weren’t particularly pleasant or dignified. I had to have a catheter inserted and doctors then filled my bladder, asking me to let them know when I needed the toilet.<br><br>‘Now,’ I said, almost immediately.<br><br>With my toilet downstairs, I’d grope my way down the steps five times a night, terrified I was going to fall down<br><br>It was then I was diagnosed with an overactive bladder – a condition that causes sufferers to feel sudden and frequent urges to urinate, which can be difficult to control.<br><br>I cannot tell you the relief I felt. It wasn’t just me – it was an actual condition. A condition that could be treated.<br><br>They advised me to have Botox injected into my bladder, which relieves symptoms by relaxing the organ – again, not particularly comfortable. But it was worth it.<br><br>I instantly noticed a huge difference. Rather than getting up three, four, even five times, in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, I was only getting up once.<br><br>Sometimes I even slept through – I felt incredible.<br><br>I could get in the car for 15 minutes and not panic about how bad the traffic was going to be. I could finally relax.<br><br>Then, I fell pregnant with my partner. Not only had I been dreading the effect this would have on my condition – the stories of the pressure unborn babies put on your bladder were rife amongst my friends who already had children – but it also meant I couldn’t have my second Botox injection.<br><br>It was unbearable. With my toilet downstairs, I’d grope my way down the steps five times a night, terrified I was going to fall down. At work, I was up and down all the time.<br><br>When I had my son, things got even worse. I’d leak and dribble all the time. I couldn’t even go out with my friends for a dance without having an accident.</p>

    <p>I felt so uncomfortable – constantly embarrassed and conscious.<br><br>I was still on the waiting list for my second Botox injection when I fell pregnant with my second child.<br><br>Even when I did have my second injection earlier this year, it wasn’t as effective as the first one had been. It helped with the urgency of needing to go there and then – but I still needed a wee all the time!<br><br>Fed up of missing out, I resigned myself to wearing incontinence pants when I went to festivals with friends. I did so with a complete feeling of defeat – but otherwise, I simply couldn’t go to these places, where you had to queue for hours to just go to the toilet.<br><br>And it was certainly better than wetting myself and having to carry around clean underwear to get changed into.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
