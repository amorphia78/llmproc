    <p>Hearing the letting agent’s words, my heart dropped and my breath caught in the back of my throat.<br><br>‘He’s selling the house,’ she told us. ‘Unfortunately, I’m having to give you your notice to move out.’<br><br>It was news no renter ever wanted to hear.<br><br>I had been in the house for three years, got on well with my three flatmates and loved the location, right in the centre of Lincoln. A situation anyone who rents will tell you is hard to come by.<br><br>But there was another, more terrifying, reason why the news knocked the wind out of me.<br><br>Just the year before, in June 2022, I had been told I had malignant tumours in my right lung and chest.<br><br>My future was already uncertain, and now it looked even bleaker than ever.<br><br>When I look back, it’s crazy to think how quickly everything had turned around. Until recently, my life had been much the same as anyone else’s.<br><br>I worked as an electrical technician and instructor at Doncaster College, I had good friends and regularly ate with my flatmates.<br><br>But then, after feeling unwell, I had been diagnosed with the lung condition, COPD at 55. With medication though, I still managed to go to work, then get out and about.<br><br>Then, in 2020, lockdown hit. Gradually, I started to feel worse than ever.<br><br>Even just walking around my house left me exhausted, and panting for breath.<br><br>Going back to the hospital in May 2022, I was given a CAT scan. I was told, ‘We need to do a biopsy.’<br><br>I will always remember, I was sitting in a bustling coffee shop when the hospital called me with the results.<br><br>‘You have cancer’ they informed me. ‘It’s sinister. Within 7 to 10 days we should receive the result of your biopsy and the oncologist will get in touch.’<br><br>I had been preparing myself for bad news, finding anything suspicious on your lungs was never going to be good. But those words…<br><br>Getting up, and walking out of the café, I felt strangely distanced from my body. As if it belonged to someone else.<br><br>I just had no idea what to do.<br><br>I had no family in this country and, although I was close to my friends, I didn’t want to burden them with my worries, my fears.<br><br>Yet, with them racing around endlessly in my head, I felt like I was going to explode.<br><br>It was shortly afterwards that someone recommended I go in to see the Macmillan Cancer Support team in their centre at Lincoln County Hospital.<br><br>And I am so glad I did. Because the lady who greeted me there, a Macmillan Information Facilitator, couldn’t have been nicer. She introduced herself as Beverley, and when she asked me what I needed, it all came blurting out.<br><br>The cancerous tumours on my lungs, how scared I felt, how I had no-one to talk to…<br><br>As she listened sympathetically, it was such a relief just to get it all off my chest.<br><br>From then on, whenever I passed the centre, I’d pop in and say hello. Although, it was never just hello – Beverley always asked me how I was doing, if I needed help. She lit up my day.<br><br>And not only was she there for me emotionally, Beverley was there for me in practical terms too.<br><br>She went through what benefits I was entitled to, helped me fill in the right forms to get Personal Independence Payment and even attended my hospital appointment with me in August 2022 to discuss my treatment plan with my consultant.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times. Then, one day, he opened his front door and started walking. He didn&#x27;t stop for three years, by which time he&#x27;d walked the coast of the UK and improved his mental health.</p>

It just destroys you. I cannot explain the fatigue, the pain…<br><br>I was so grateful for my flatmates, and my kindly neighbours, who brought me shopping when I was too poorly to go out, made meals for me when I was too exhausted to get out of bed and cook.<br><br>So, when at the end of July 2023, my landlord gave us two months’ notice to find somewhere else to live, it just felt like the last straw. A truly devastating blow.<br><br>Thankfully, Beverley was there for me again. She helped get me on the emergency list for a council house. And when they found me one, she arranged a Macmillan grant to help get some essentials – a bed, a sofa, a table – from local charity shops.<br><br>My life now couldn’t be more different from what it was.<br><br>I live on the outskirts of the city, and no longer have the daily support of my friends and flatmates. My house is still bare.<br><br>Back when I was well, I never thought twice about buying toilet roll or tea bags, but now, I fret about the cost of even these minor purchases.<br><br>Every day, I find myself asking, am I going to have a shower or put the heating on? Put the heating on or should I eat?<br><br>I have recently heard that my treatment wasn’t successful and I am currently waiting to hear what steps I can take next.<br><br>I can’t deny my future looks dark, but without support, it would be unbearable. And I want to thank Beverly from the bottom of my heart for what she has done for me.<br><br>Macmillan Cancer Support has launched its first ‘Winter Gift Guide’, which highlights the huge variety of essentials many people living with cancer need but can’t afford, such as blankets or hygiene products, and the vital impact a Macmillan Grant can have.
