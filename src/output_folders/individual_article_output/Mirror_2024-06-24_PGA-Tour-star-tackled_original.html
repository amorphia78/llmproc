    <p>PGA Tour star Adam Hadwin couldn&#x27;t resist a cheeky dig at his own past mishap after Extinction Rebellion activists disrupted the Travelers Championship.<br><br>The protestors invaded the 18th green at TPC River Highlands on Sunday at the climax of the tournament, with security guards and police on hand to quickly detain them in a scene all too familiar for Hadwin.<br><br>At last year&#x27;s Canadian Open, in a moment of high spirits, he bolted onto Toronto&#x27;s Oakdale Golf and Country Club to join in celebrating Nick Taylor&#x27;s historic win - the first Canadian in 69 years to clinch the title at their national tournament.<br><br>However, in the midst of the jubilation, Hadwin had overlooked one small detail - wearing his credentials. His attempt to douse the victory in champagne was abruptly interrupted by a vigilant guard who tackled him to the ground, with the mix-up eventually being sorted out.<br><br>Following the Extinction Rebellion protest, Hadwin took to X and joked (via the Express ): &quot;I&#x27;d like to point out that when I was tackled, I held onto the bottle. Unlike this guy.&quot;<br><br>One of activists in question was gearing up to unleash a bag of orange powder before being taken down, losing grip of it as a result. This incident unfolded just as frontrunner Scottie Scheffler and close contender Tom Kim were wrapping up their final round in Connecticut.<br><br>Despite the commotion, the game&#x27;s integrity remained intact as no golf balls or markers were affected, allowing play to continue after a brief five-minute pause. But the interruption may have impacted Scheffler slightly, as he fluffed a birdie putt, while Kim seized the moment to sink a 10-yarder, pulling even with the lead.</p>

    <p>The green was cleared of any powder and the hole moved for the play-off, which Scheffler won with a par after Kim was unable to get up and down from the bunker. The world No.1 therefore became the first player to win six times before July since Arnold Palmer in 1962.<br><br>It follows his victories at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, The Players, The Masters, RBC Heritage and Memorial Tournament, extending his lead at the top of the Official World Golf Ranking even further.<br><br>Recognising the magnitude of his achievement, Scheffler admitted during his post-round media duties: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty special. It&#x27;s been a great season, I&#x27;ve been fortunate to come away with some wins and it&#x27;s been a lot of fun. Tom played his heart out. He&#x27;s a great player, a great champion and it was fun battling with him.&quot;<br><br>Touching on the protests, he added: &quot;Fortunately for Tom and me we&#x27;re great friends so we were able to kind of relax each other. You don&#x27;t really understand the situation, there&#x27;s people running around everywhere and you don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s going to happen, so it&#x27;s a bit confusing.&quot;<br><br>Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.
