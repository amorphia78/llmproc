    <p>I used to spoil my only daughter, Sania – now aged 16 – for Christmas.<br><br>We’d decorate our house with lights, buy a large tree, wear matching pyjamas, and even go on an annual trip. We’ve been to the big adventure water parks in Stoke-On-Trent, the Black history museum exhibitions in Liverpool and the pier in Brighton.<br><br>Then there were the presents – sometimes up to a dozen for her. One year, she was begging me for an electric scooter, so I saved up months for it and bought one for her.<br><br>As a mother, to see the smile on the face of my child when she unwraps her gifts or experiences Christmas joy is everything.<br><br>But this year, it won’t be a big occasion. In fact it won’t be an occasion at all.<br><br>Christmas is cancelled in our house. The cost-of-living crisis has meant that properly celebrating this holiday for disabled people is simply impossible.<br><br>Everything changed for me in 2015.<br><br>I was working as an English language teacher, but I had a stroke at the age of 38 and then had emergency open-heart surgery. Sania was only eight then, and it was a tough time.<br><br>Unfortunately, the stroke brought on all my current health problems – including diabetes and high blood pressure. Ever since, I use an electric wheelchair and it’s why I have to sleep with oxygen.<br><br>I also went into a serious depression, but I didn’t want to accept it. As a result, I locked myself away from everyone and the only person I wanted to see was my daughter. She is what keeps me going.<br><br>At the time, she knew mummy wasn’t well, but she didn’t realise how bad until she reached the age she is now.<br><br>I couldn’t work so I applied for benefits, which came to about £600 a month.<br><br>It was a hard adjustment but you end up having to make do. Until the pandemic, I was managing my money and budgeting accordingly, but we were only just getting by.<br><br>In the last few years, however, things have become unmanageable. The cost of everything is so high that we couldn’t afford Christmas last year.<br><br>At the time, I explained to Sania: ‘Mummy is broke and has no money’. I told her that things had become so expensive that – until we can afford it – we wouldn’t be able to have Christmas.<br><br>She was disappointed, to say the least – she’s still a child after all. But she was understanding.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times. Then, one day, he opened his front door and started walking.

    <p>So last Christmas Day, the strength of my medication meant I just slept. Sania wanted to be near me so she came into my room and she sat with me, shaking me awake so we could watch a film together.<br><br>Thankfully, my niece in the US sent her $100 (£80) for her 16th birthday last year, which was in December.<br><br>Our financial situation hasn’t improved since then so, unfortunately, we have to cancel Christmas this year too. We’ll spend it the same way as last year.<br><br>No mother wants to cancel Christmas, so it feels awful. My spirits are really dampened.<br><br>People might tell me to budget better, but how do I do that when there is no budget? Day-to-day, if Saina and I can’t afford food in the shops because we have to pay for the electricity, then we have to put that food back on the shelf.<br><br>It’s not just Christmas we are cancelling, it’s life in general – including Sania’s birthday.<br><br>To not be able to make days like these special for your child is just unimaginably hard. But there’s nothing I can do.<br><br>She’s such a good girl and she says to me: ‘Oh mummy, I want to help you so much, I want a job.’ but she’s at college and it’s so tricky for her to get employed at such a young age.<br><br>I know our family is not alone.<br><br>Research commissioned by disability charity Scope found that almost one in three disabled people say they expect to be struggling financially this winter – while a third say they will struggle to enjoy Christmas due to the cost.<br><br>So I’m trying to use my story to try and raise awareness, and support Scope’s vital helpline for people who are unable to cope.<br><br>I’ve been helped by their Disability Energy Support (DES) with advice and a voucher. They gave me £30 to put towards my energy bill when I needed it most.<br><br>They also gave me advice about how I can save energy in a practical way at home, like turning off switches and things. It was definitely helpful.<br><br>The way I feel now and the life we have is really pushing me to try and go out and work, even though I’m too ill. It’s a desperate situation.<br><br>Some people might wonder if I have a message to the Government – but what’s the point? I know they aren’t listening to people like me.<br><br>So, until someone does listen, Christmas is cancelled. For me, and many others.<br><br>And I don’t know how we’re expected to keep living like this.<br><br>Life admin apps to save the day?
