    <p>PRIMARY: At least five climate change protesters from Extinction Rebellion stormed the 18th green during the final round of the Travelers Championship, disrupting crucial putts by Scottie Scheffler and Tom Kim. The protesters wore t-shirts reading &quot;No Golf On A Dead Planet&quot; and threw red, white and yellow powder on the course before being arrested. Their stated demand was to highlight the &quot;worldwide danger of climate breakdown.&quot;<br><br>SECONDARY: Extinction Rebellion released a statement connecting their protest to Saturday&#x27;s lightning strike that injured spectators, citing it as evidence of extreme weather caused by climate change.</p>
