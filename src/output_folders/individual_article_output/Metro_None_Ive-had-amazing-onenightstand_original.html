    <p>It was 8am and I was scurrying down the pavement, carrying my high heels in my hands and with my hair in serious knots – a universal look that practically screams ‘guess who had sex all night’.<br><br>It had been a great evening; I’d hit it off with a very attractive man on the dance floor and after furiously making out for an hour, we headed back to his place.<br><br>I really should have taken a cab home but my lover only lived 15 minutes from my house, and I don’t like to be wasteful with money.<br><br>However, judging by the stares from drivers on the main road, and the fact three cars honked at me in the space of a few minutes, it was evident that they knew this was my ‘walk of shame’. (I loathe this phrase but I’ll get to that later).<br><br>Some of them even shouted from their windows; though I can’t remember the exact words, they weren’t nice ones.<br><br>At the time, I tried not to think too much of the situation but the memory of walking home that day is burned into my mind. I can still recall the anger I felt at being shamed by strangers for having a one-night-stand.<br><br>Whether intended or not, these people made me feel embarrassed about having enjoyed my body and someone else’s, which is ridiculous.<br><br>This was around 2012 and while the world is more progressive now, there is still a negative attitude towards no-strings sex.<br><br>Love reading juicy stories like this?

We can&#x27;t wait for you to join us!<br><br>I’d like to put this issue to bed once and for all and explain why one-night-stands can actually be a great way for you to explore sex.<br><br>Let’s start by tackling a common myth.<br><br>Many people believe that having a one-night-stand somehow means that you don’t respect yourself, which is absolutely not true.<br><br>Now that I’m in my 30s, I prefer to have more long-term sexual connections. Not because I’m opposed to a great casual shag but I had a very active sex life in my 20s, so I’ve been there, done that.<br><br>But a few years ago, I found myself in a pub, watching a football game with mates when a sexual opportunity presented itself.<br><br>One of the men in our group was a friend of a friend, and we had an instant attraction.<br><br>During half time, we snuck away to have a fumble. A few hours later, we were in my bed – where we remained until the next morning.<br><br>This man (let’s call him Josh) was only in town for the weekend so we both knew there was no prospect of romance.<br><br>Sometimes, shagging strangers is easier because it lifts our inhibitions<br><br>But that didn’t mean we respected each other any less.<br><br>We were both consenting adults chasing an orgasm. He was attentive, sweet and we cuddled for a few hours afterwards.<br><br>When he left the next morning, I didn’t feel any shame.<br><br>But it’s taken me a long time to get to this point.<br><br>Unfortunately, society likes to tell us that sex must have an emotional component. If it doesn’t, it’s not ‘worth’ as much.<br><br>This is another myth.<br><br>Sex shouldn’t be assigned a value and neither should you.<br><br>I’ve had some of the best sex of my life with one-night-stands.<br><br>Sometimes, ‘no strings’ is exactly what we need. Casual sex can serve as a confidence booster, libido awakener and many other things.<br><br>For instance, after I broke up with a long-term boyfriend, I wasn’t remotely interested in sex for months.<br><br>My sex drive was all but switched off until one day, out of the blue, I met a man at a friend’s birthday party and we swapped numbers.<br><br>Meeting up a few days later for a drink, my sex drive fired up. It didn’t hurt that he was an amazing kisser and knew exactly which buttons to push.<br><br>We went home and had mind-blowing sex for hours. It was the kind of shag that makes you weak in the knees afterwards.</p>

    <p>I liked this man but I didn’t have any particular romantic feelings towards him. I had no idea if we’d ever see each other again (we didn’t).<br><br>Funnily enough, he wasn’t such a nice guy in the end – he ghosted me after the sex – but I still don’t regret what happened.<br><br>I’d gone into this with open eyes, knowing that sex might be all we had in common so I wasn’t particularly upset.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
