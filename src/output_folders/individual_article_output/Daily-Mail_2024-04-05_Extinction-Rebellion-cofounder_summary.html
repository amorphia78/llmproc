    <p>PRIMARY: Roger Hallam (Extinction Rebellion co-founder), Larch Maxey, and Michael Lynch-White plotted to close Heathrow Airport by flying drones near it in September 2019 under the banner &quot;Heathrow Pause.&quot; Their demand was to force the Government to abandon plans for a third runway at Heathrow. The protest failed to attract hundreds as planned and caused no actual flight disruptions, though policing costs exceeded £1 million. All three received suspended prison sentences.</p>
