They caused Â£10,000 damage to the frame and were sentenced to two and 20 months in jail respectively for the October 2022 action.<br><br>SECONDARY: JSO supporters gathered outside court with posters of historical activist figures. Plummer was also involved in a slow march causing traffic delays and arrested for spraying paint on Heathrow departure boards. JSO previously targeted Constable&#x27;s The Hay Wain.</p>
