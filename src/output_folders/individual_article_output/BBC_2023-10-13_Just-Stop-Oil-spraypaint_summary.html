    <p>PRIMARY: Just Stop Oil activists sprayed orange paint on universities across England including Leeds, Manchester, Cambridge, Bristol, Exeter, Oxford, Falmouth, Sussex, Birmingham and UCL over several days.

Named protesters include recent Leeds graduate Sam Holland (21), Chiara Sarti (24) at Cambridge, philosophy student Harrison (20) at Birmingham, and Oscar (20) at Sussex who wanted to be a teacher. Multiple arrests were made for criminal damage.</p>
