    <p>‘So, how many people have you slept with?,’ he asks as I take another sip of my drink.<br><br>I’m on a date in a busy pub and we’ve reached that special moment of the night where the sexy chat slips in.<br><br>The bit where you’ve covered the small talk and are just about tipsy enough to ask more intimate questions.<br><br>Looking over at him, I play out scenarios in my head.<br><br>I know all too well how he might react if he doesn’t like the answer. I’ve been here many times before.<br><br>I’m not ashamed of my sex life but I can’t be bothered to get that look – the one that says, ‘Wow, really? You’re a woman, shouldn’t your number be lower?’.<br><br>So, in the end, I fob the question off.<br><br>This was a long time ago, back when I thought I had to keep my sexual experiences a secret.<br><br>These days, I know better (and I also date more respectful men) – but, while I no longer feel awkward about my so-called ‘body count’, I still won’t share how many sexual partners I’ve had.<br><br>Love reading juicy stories like this?

We can&#x27;t wait for you to join us!<br><br>Firstly, I’ve realised that nothing good ever comes from this conversation.<br><br>You see, it doesn’t matter what the figure is, because the other person isn’t actually asking you how much sex you’ve had.<br><br>In reality, they are – consciously or subconsciously – collecting information to assign a value to your sexual habits and trying to find out if your experiences align with their own.<br><br>As a woman, this type of situation is extra tricky because our patriarchal society likes to dictate what we do in the bedroom.<br><br>And it gets even more difficult if, like me, you’ve had a lot of sexual partners.<br><br>(Side note: ‘a lot’ means different things to different people, so for the sake of my argument, let’s say it’s above the global average, which is nine lovers in a lifetime).<br><br>An ex of mine was adamant about knowing this detail. When I finally told him, it backfired spectacularly – because his figure was lower than mine.<br><br>While he didn’t say it out loud, it became clear that my experiences bothered him.<br><br>Insecurity is understandable and we should always be sensitive to other people’s feelings but in my situation, this ex suddenly began acting jealous whenever I spoke to another man, even if it was just to order drinks at the bar.<br><br>This new information had changed his perception of me.<br><br>I’ve never been OK with someone telling me what I should or shouldn’t do so, as you can probably guess, this relationship didn’t last.<br><br>But it’s not just romantic or sexual partners who changed their view of me – some mates have treated me differently too.<br><br>On a night out, one male friend suggested I have sex with one of the other men in our group because ‘he needed a good shag’.<br><br>It was incredibly hurtful that he thought my ‘number’ meant I would sleep with anyone, if the offer was good enough.<br><br>Which isn’t the case at all.<br><br>I like sex but I choose my sexual partners, I don’t just fall into bed with the first penis I see.<br><br>This incident happened when I was in my 20s and I didn’t feel comfortable telling this ‘friend’ off at the time, but I cut ties with him the next day.<br><br>Oddly, back then, these experiences spurred me on to share my figure as a point of pride.<br><br>It was an act of rebellion. I was a woman in charge of my pleasure and I was tired of society telling me that it was ‘unladylike’ to discuss my sex life.</p>

    <p>Why should men get to have all the fun, right?<br><br>But, while I had good intentions, this wasn’t a healthy approach.<br><br>Because I felt like I had something to prove. I wanted to show those who called me names that I was a ‘proud slut’ and that I could f**k whoever the hell I wanted.<br><br>By justifying my sex life, I gave them power over me.<br><br>And eventually, part of me began to believe that this number said something about my character – when it really didn’t.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
