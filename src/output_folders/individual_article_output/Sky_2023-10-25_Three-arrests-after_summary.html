    <p>Three people have been arrested after orange paint was sprayed on Wellington Arch in London by Just Stop Oil protesters.<br><br>Smoke flares were also set off alongside the Grade I-listed monument, which is nearly 200 years old.<br><br>Campaigners used fire extinguishers to spray the paint as part of the protest against new fossil fuel licences.<br><br>According to the Just Stop Oil website, one of those taking action at the monument was Joshua Lane, 26, an engineer from Sheffield, who said: &quot;I am compelled to take action due to the severity, and sheer emergency we find ourselves in today.<br><br>&quot;Future generations live in uncertainty, and we are given false promises time after time by endless pantomime governments.&quot;<br><br>Another of the activists, Joe Hogan, 40, from Hertfordshire, said: &quot;Traditional, managed, sanitised forms of protest have done nothing.</p>
