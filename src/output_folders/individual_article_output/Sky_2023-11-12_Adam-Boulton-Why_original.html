        <h1>Adam Boulton: Why Met Police chief has a firmer grasp on liberal democracy than Suella Braverman</h1><h2>If one aim of the Hamas terror attack on 7 October was to spread confusion and panic among Israel and its allies they have certainly succeeded in the UK, setting the prime minister, the home secretary and the nation's chief of police at odds.</h2><p>&quot;The right to freedom of expression and assembly are fundamental aspects of a liberal democratic society.&quot; The House of Commons Library briefing for MPs, issued this August, could not be clearer.<br><br>The home secretary began her controversial Times article last week by declaring &quot;peaceful marches are never banned and even controversial and disruptive ones are policed rather than blocked&quot;.<br><br>Yet both the prime minister and home secretary expressed the opinion that this weekend&#x27;s pro-Palestinian march should not take place, contrary to the decision by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley not to seek a ban from the home secretary.<br><br>Rishi Sunak warned ominously &quot;it is my job to hold him accountable&quot;.<br><br>Suella Braverman went further, accusing the Met of &quot;double standards&quot; and the perception that they &quot;play favourites when it comes to protesters&quot;. She repeated her view that the pro-Palestinians are &quot;hate marchers&quot;.<br><br>The prime minister&#x27;s office equivocated that Downing Street had seen her article in advance without approving it and that Mr Sunak still had full confidence in his home secretary.<br><br>If one aim of the Hamas terror attack on 7 October was to spread confusion and panic among Israel and its allies they have certainly succeeded in the UK, setting the prime minister, the home secretary and the nation&#x27;s chief of police at odds.<br><br>An accident of the calendar added to the tension. This year Remembrance Day, 11 November, the traditional date to commemorate those who died defending their country in war, happened to fall on a Saturday, the traditional non-working day for major protest marches in the capital.<br><br>Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player<br><br>Ms Braverman seemed anxious to foment this apparent clash of cultural attitudes, however unwilling the organisations involved with the two events were to be drawn in.<br><br>Both the Royal British Legion and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign argued that both their plans should go ahead and that they should not disrupt each other. Jewish representatives were clear that they did not want the Palestinian march banned on their account.<br><br>The pro-Palestinians chose to set aside Sir Mark&#x27;s earlier request to &quot;urgently reconsider&quot; a protest on 11 November as &quot;not appropriate&quot;.<br><br>10 out of 12 marches not permitted were planned by right-wing groups<br><br>Meanwhile other events went ahead on Saturday, including the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show, which shuts down roads in the City of London for a 24-hour period.<br><br>The usual Remembrance Sunday Service at the Cenotaph, attended by the Monarch and political leaders, is due to go ahead with no scheduled conflict with other protests. The Met usually permits, and monitors, a Remembrance march by the English Defence League.<br><br>Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player<br><br>Statistics are not published on marches which are denied permission. The last known ban was on the EDL in 2011. Ten out of 12 of those not permitted under the Public Order Act were planned by right-wing organisations.<br><br>This seems to be of concern to Ms Braverman, who complains that &quot;pro-Palestinian mobs&quot; and Black Lives Matter have not met with the same &quot;stern response&quot; as &quot;right-wing and nationalist protesters&quot;.<br><br>Conversely she is unhappy with the &quot;tough&quot; treatment of &quot;lockdown objectors&quot; and &quot;football fans&quot;.<br><br>Job of controlling crowds used to fall to military<br><br>The point of public protests is to register dissent from positions taken by those in authority, often governments, and to support sides in issues over which there is controversy.<br><br>Not surprisingly, this has often brought protesters into confrontation with governments and sometimes into conflict with the forces they task with maintaining order.<br><br>Before the establishment of civilian police forces, the job of controlling crowds usually fell to the military, sometimes with violent consequences.<br><br>In 1819, 18 people were killed and over 400 injured when cavalry charged protesters for civil rights at Peterloo in Manchester. In 1834 in Newport, around 20 people were killed and 50 wounded in a firefight between soldiers in the 45th Regiment of Foot and armed Chartists, demanding political reform.<br><br>Subsequently the principle was established that the primary role of the police force is to protect the right of free speech, including protest, provided that those taking part were not breaking the law in some other aspect.<br><br>This could prove highly controversial.<br><br>In 1936 the Metropolitan Police were mobilised to protect a march by the British Union of Fascists, Sir Oswald Mosley&#x27;s &quot;Black Shirts&quot;, through the East End of London, including areas with a significant Jewish population.</p>

Clashes between police and rival demonstrators followed, with over 150 arrests, most famously when the police attempted to remove a barricade which had been placed across Cable Street.<br><br>The Public Order Act 1936, which followed &quot;the Battle of Cable Street&quot;, established some key restrictions on future protests in the UK. It outlawed the wearing of political uniforms and it forced organisers of large meetings and demonstrations to obtain police permission.<br><br>Crucially the police gained powers independently to impose conditions relating to the duration and route of marches.

By then a previous convention banning demonstrations in the area had been abandoned and permanent encampments had been set up by a number of protest movements including Anti-Pinochet, the Countryside Alliance and Stop the War.
