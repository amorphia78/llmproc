        <h1>Gatwick second runway backed by government</h1><p>A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.<br><br>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was &quot;minded to approve&quot; the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed.<br><br>The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.<br><br>The transport secretary&#x27;s support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.<br><br>If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The Â£2.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.<br><br>&quot;I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,&quot; Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.<br><br>Gatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October.<br><br>Stewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has &quot;outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year&quot; and that the airport would &quot;engage fully&quot; in the process.<br><br>The Transport Secretary&#x27;s support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.<br><br>Gatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe&#x27;s busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year.<br><br>On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was &quot;not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior&quot;.<br><br>The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK&#x27;s two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.<br><br>An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow&#x27;s longer-haul flights.<br><br>Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is &quot;full&quot;.<br><br>Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued.<br><br>It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.<br><br>But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.</p><p>Greenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. &quot;The only thing it&#x27;s set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,&quot; he added.<br><br>Alex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country.<br><br>&quot;People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,&quot; he added.<br><br>Union Unite general secretary Sharon Graham backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need &quot;to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers&quot;.<br><br>Bronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be &quot;a win for everyone&quot;.<br><br>She said it would create more flight slots across both runways.<br><br>&quot;That allows us to offer new routes, new airlines, more frequencies on existing routes, so that passengers have more choice.&quot;<br><br>Sally Pavey, chair of Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions (CAGNE), is worried about &quot;uncontrollable noise, ramifications on the roads, decline in air quality... and climate change&quot;.<br><br>&quot;We can&#x27;t keep ignoring climate change and it would be wrong to allow a new &#x27;bucket and spade&#x27; runway, as we put it, at the expense of residents and the economy,&quot; she said.<br><br>The group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added.<br><br>Gatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise.<br><br>On Wednesday the government&#x27;s independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country&#x27;s climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country&#x27;s aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels.<br><br>Some of the pollution from flying, it said, could be reduced by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and by capturing the planet-warming gases released.<br><br>But experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF.<br><br>The UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry&#x27;s impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying.<br><br>At current levels demand is expected to grow by 53% by 2040, while the UKCCC says this should be closer to 16%.<br><br>Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.
