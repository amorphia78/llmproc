    <p>PRIMARY: Greta Thunberg and 25 other protesters from Fossil Free London blocked the entrance to London&#x27;s InterContinental Hotel on October 17, preventing access during an oil executives&#x27; conference. Some climbed onto the roof and abseiled down while others sat in the road. After 5 hours, police ordered them to move to the pavement but they refused and were arrested.<br><br>SECONDARY: Greenpeace members separately rappelled down the building to unfurl a &quot;Make big oil pay&quot; banner during the same protest.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article focuses significantly on Thunberg&#x27;s court appearance where she pleaded not guilty to public order charges and was granted bail for a February trial.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a relatively neutral tone while emphasizing Thunberg&#x27;s cheerful demeanor throughout the legal proceedings.</p>
