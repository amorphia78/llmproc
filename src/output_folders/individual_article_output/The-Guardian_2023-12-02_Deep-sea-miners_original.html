    <p>The Metals Company sought an injunction in the Netherlands, where the Arctic Sunrise is registered, to force protesters to stay 500 metres from the Coco. But in a summary ruling, Amsterdam district court said protests could continue around the ship, although it ruled that Greenpeace’s climbers had to come down or the organisation would face fines of €50,000 a day.<br><br>Both sides have claimed victory in the case. Greenpeace called the ruling “a massive setback for the deep sea mining industry”. It also lashed out at The Metals Company, claiming it “has never been interested in scrutiny and they can’t stand that Greenpeace is watching and opposing them at every turn”.<br><br>Sign up to Down to Earth<br><br>The planet&#x27;s most important stories.
