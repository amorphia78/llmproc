        <h1>Retired priest speaks of ‘painful’ treatment by church over her climate protests</h1><p>PRIMARY: 82-year-old retired priest Rev Sue Parfitt was arrested in May for allegedly damaging glass around Magna Carta at the British Library during a Just Stop Oil protest. Following her arrest, Bristol diocese denied her Permission to Officiate (PTO), preventing her from conducting religious ceremonies. Parfitt has participated in dozens of climate protests and refuses to commit to avoiding future illegal actions.<br><br>SECONDARY: The article mentions Parfitt&#x27;s broader involvement with Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain protests over recent years, and references other activists facing professional consequences including GPs awaiting tribunals and five activists receiving 4-5 year prison sentences.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article highlights tensions within the Church of England regarding climate activism, particularly the irony that Bishop Vivienne Faull, who led progressive climate action, denied Parfitt&#x27;s license despite their shared history as early female priests.<br><br>TONE: The article presents a sympathetic portrayal of Parfitt&#x27;s situation, emphasizing her pain and disappointment while highlighting contradictions in the church&#x27;s stance.</p></body></html>
