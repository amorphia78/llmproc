    <p>Iconic football star Paul ‘Gazza’ Gascoigne recently hit the road to speak live in front of audiences across the world – a tour he compared to Taylor Swift’s Eras tour.<br><br>The icon, 57, joked that his Audience With Paul Gascoigne show is just like the pop icon’s record-breaking tour and, in a recent interview, opened up about what it’s like to be back in front of crowds again, saying the buzz makes him ’emotionally soft.’<br><br>During his shows, he relives his career as one of the most legendary midfielders of all time, as well as sharing anecdotes from his personal life.<br><br>‘I tell them jokes and say “I did play football as well during my career”,’ he told The Mirror. ‘It’s good seeing the fans again. I did 460 selfies at one show in Sheffield.’<br><br>Gazza’s return to the limelight has only been made possible by his hard-won sobriety, which he’s been able to maintain by moving into his agent Katie Davies’ spare room in Poole.<br><br>During an interview with High Performance, Gazza explained what changed with his relationship to alcohol: ‘I used to be a happy drunk. I ain’t anymore. I’m a sad drunk. I don’t go out and drink, I drink indoors.<br><br>‘People know Paul Gascoigne but Gazza, no one knows. Even me sometimes. I’ve spent a lot of years being down, when I did my ligaments and then my kneecap, I missed four years of football. I would’ve got 100 caps (for England).<br><br>‘I try not to get down because the world’s already down enough. And when I’m really down, that’s when I pick up a drink to cheer myself up.<br><br>‘I don’t think I let any managers down, or the players or the fans you know. If there was anyone I let down, it was myself. But more the drinking side of it, when I finished playing.’<br><br>He explained to The Mirror his decision to get sober: ‘I called Katie up in November a few years ago crying my eyes out.<br><br>‘What I put myself through and other people, jail and rehab – taking cocaine off toilet seats – and then I’m asked to be ambassador for my country, I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.<br><br>‘When I do these venues, I hardly talk about football, more the crazy stuff I used to get up to. I’ve got to get straight in and get them laughing.<br><br>‘There’s a few times when I’ve cried on stage. You miss it on a Saturday, you know, entertaining people. I got such a f***ing buzz from it and you miss that.<br><br>‘I can be emotionally soft. It doesn’t take long for us to cry sometimes. I keep a lot of stuff in, stuff I should share but get scared of sharing with people. I don’t think I’ll ever grow up, which I don’t mind you know?</p>

    <p>‘I’m proud of what I’ve given people. I gave nearly a million quid to 10 different charities and called them to keep it quiet.<br><br>‘I’ve never (given up). I think the time I’ll give in is when I’m in a wooden box. Apart from that, I’ll keep on fighting on.’<br><br>He spoke extensively about this difficult time in his life while on tour as well as some of the more iconic stories from his football career.<br><br>He reminisiced during the interview: ‘At Euro 96, there was a great atmosphere in the team hotel. Gareth Southgate, David Batty and Stuart Pearce would be playing cards, I would be playing snooker with Steve McManaman and Robbie Fowler.<br><br>‘Southgate was quiet, a great defender, solid in training and really well organised. I always joke that I scored my penalty in the semi, and ended up in rehab. He missed and got a £30,000 pizza advert and the England manager’s job.’<br><br>He also discussed some of the moments of glory from his iconic career, reminiscing: ‘There were 90,000 people singing “there is only one Paul Gascoigne” for our win against Holland, there were tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat,’ he shared.<br><br>He also recalled a moment after Italia 90 when he met Pope John Paul II, Princess Diana, Elton John, Robbie Williams, George Clooney, and Dustin Hoffman.‌<br><br>Another crowd-favourite story was the time he had to literally pull his hair out before a game: ‘I had a weave on top,’ he said.<br><br>‘But I got some plaids put in and Archie Knox said to me “you cannot go out like that. They will have to go or you’ll be dropped.” So I had to pull them all out. It was sewn in, not syrup but a weave. It took so long to get it all out.<br><br>‘It came out in clumps.’<br><br>Got a story?<br><br>If you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: From Taylor Swift to the Olympics, the spotlight is on this little-known part of Paris<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: Just Stop Oil cover planes in paint ‘hours after Taylor Swift’s private jet arrived’<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: Joe Alwyn breaks silence on ‘long, loving, fully committed relationship’ with ex Taylor Swift</p>
