    <p>PRIMARY: Cambridge music student Cressida Gethin, 22, is on trial for scaling a motorway gantry above the M25 near Heathrow on July 20, 2022, as part of a Just Stop Oil protest. The action caused 4-5 hours of traffic disruption the day after the UK&#x27;s hottest temperature was recorded. She denies causing public nuisance, claiming she didn&#x27;t intend &quot;spectacular disruption&quot; but realized it was more effective than expected.<br><br>SECONDARY: No secondary protest actions mentioned.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: BBC broadcaster Chris Packham testified as a defense witness, stating he &quot;selectively&quot; supports Just Stop Oil actions. Despite being stuck in the resulting traffic jam, he said he came to sympathize with the protesters&#x27; motivations regarding climate change.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral, factual tone focused on court proceedings rather than expressing judgment about the protest.</p>
