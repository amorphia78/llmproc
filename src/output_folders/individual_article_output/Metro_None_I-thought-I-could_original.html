    <p>The moment my husband told me our dog had disappeared on Guy Fawkes Night, I thought it was a joke.<br><br>He was deliberately walking the dog early because Gatsby is scared of fireworks, and we wanted him safely back at home before it got dark and celebrations began.<br><br>Despite being just around the corner – metres from the front door and on the lead – Gatsby bolted after someone let off a firework nearby while it was still light.<br><br>We’d had our a gorgeous, friendly and energetic cockapoo for two years at the point and were both terrified about where he was.<br><br>As the sun went down, I felt sick and anxious. Our wonderful dog was on his own, running scared on the worst night of the year, with fireworks now starting to explode around us.<br><br>Fireworks can be traumatic for lots of pets (and people). According to the Kennel Club, nearly half of dogs are scared of fireworks, and 80% of dog owners notice changes in their pet’s behaviour when fireworks go off.<br><br>Dogs have a stronger sense of hearing than humans, so explosions that are loud for us can be overwhelming for them.<br><br>It’s not just dogs that can find fireworks hard. Other animals, like cats, can find them stressful, as can wildlife and livestock.<br><br>Fireworks have been used for centuries as a form of celebration and lots of people do enjoy them responsibly – but we have to work out how we can keep each other, and our animals safe, while we use them.<br><br>The impact of just one firework was huge for us, but I doubt the person who lit it knew anything about that.<br><br>After Gatsby ran away, we rushed out to look for him, combing our local park and streets for hours. After helplessly looking for him, I posted on social media and hundreds of my friends, neighbours and even strangers came out to help us search for him. I felt both hopeful that any minute we’d find him, and extremely scared that we wouldn’t while we searched.<br><br>Local dog walkers started organising search parties and the streets were lit up with phone torches and people shouting Gatsby’s name.<br><br>I was contacted by Dogs Lost, a group that helps coordinate efforts for missing dogs. They told me to contact local vets, and to make sure someone was at home as many dogs return there. Despite the horrible circumstances it was incredible to see so many people desperate to help.<br><br>At 4am, just as I was giving up hope, I got a call. Someone living a few streets away had heard barking and found Gatsby outside her house, his lead caught under a tyre. I rushed over to pick him up.<br><br>I was overjoyed and unable to process that he’d been found. He was cold and shivery but ultimately fine.<br><br>Luckily our story had a happy ending, but according to research there’s nearly a 100% increase in missing dogs during firework season.<br><br>Thousands of pets go missing each year, and with the rise in pet ownership during the pandemic this is sure to increase.<br><br>Since getting a dog, I see 5 November in a new light. While I love a firework display as the next person, Bonfire Night is now more about damage limitation than enjoyment.<br><br>If you have a pet, take our story as a reason to be extra careful all the time during firework season.</p>

    <p>And if you are planning fireworks this year, please think about your four-legged neighbours. You could consider letting people nearby know in advance so they can make plans and think about the time you are setting off fireworks – too early and people might not be prepared.<br><br>You might want to opt for low noise fireworks for less disruption. Take extra care if you are letting off fireworks outside of traditional times like Bonfire Night, Diwali or New Year’s Eve as this can catch people by surprise.<br><br>For pet owners, be extra cautious. Get your pets home well before it’s starting to get dark. Keep them inside and your doors and windows shut. Make sure your pet is microchipped and has your phone number on their collar in case they go missing at any time.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
