        <h1>Glastonbury Festival veterans share one item to bring that will save you a fortune</h1><p>Glastonbury Festival fans have shared their ultimate must-haves for enjoying the iconic Worthy Farm event. One item in particular is key to the full experience, according to veterans of the festival who shared their experience of travelling solo with a first-timer.<br><br>A new festival-goer took to the r/GlastonburyFestival group to seek tips from veterans for this year&#x27;s event, which will feature top billing acts like The 1975, Neil Young, and Olivia Rodrigo. With tickets for Glastonbury selling out in a mere 35 minutes, those who managed to nab a spot are eagerly swapping advice on what essentials to pack for their adventure at the legendary fest.<br><br>The Reddit inquiry asked: &quot;What to take to Glastonbury when travelling by train and going solo? I&#x27;m doing Glastonbury for the first time and travelling there from London by train. A lot of the packing lists I see suggest taking a trolley, portable showers, portable chairs etc but do you need all of that?<br><br>&quot;Space on the train will be limited but I want to make sure I have all of the essentials. What would you advise taking if it&#x27;s just me and whatever I can carry on my back? Thanks.&quot;<br><br>Festival attendees have taken to social media to dish out advice for those new to the game. One reveller posted: &quot;Prioritise spirts maybe for booze, you can buy cheap mixers there.&quot;<br><br>Another joked: &quot;100% this. Take your tent, about 20 litres of vodka, a toothbrush, and a spare pair of underpants. Everything else is superfluous.&quot;<br><br>The chorus of booze suggestions continued as a third wrote &quot;spirits, spirits, spirits&quot; as the go-to festival essential. Another advised newcomers to the festival &quot;concentrate on spirits in the reusable pouches&quot;.<br><br>A practical attendee even recommended using the trolley mentioned in the original post for hauling alcohol and shower necessities but acknowledged &quot;spirits&quot; as a simple addition.</p><p>While it may seem like a joke to advise festival-goers to bring their own booze, it&#x27;s actually a pretty practical tip as drinks prices can be so expensive.<br><br>Last year, attendees were furious about the cost of beverages at Glasto. At the standard bars on site, a single bottle of Prosecco was priced at £43 - almost two times more than you’d pay at the average restaurant. Meanwhile, a pint of beer set festival goers back between 6.75 and £7, with a glass of wine costing £7.75 and double spirits and mixers set at £12.50.<br><br>However, it goes without saying you should be mindful about how much alcohol you are consuming for the sake of your health.<br><br>Other Redditors offered genuine guidance, sharing their own survival lists online. An experienced festival-goer penned a checklist, which reads: &quot;Camping backpack, tent, sleeping bag, camping mat, lightweight chair of some type (check decathlon for some that pack very small).<br><br>&quot;Maybe a small stove if you like hot beverages in the AM. Some emergency food/bars etc. Then clothes, usual supplies, and 2/3 black bin liners for multi purpose usage.&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, another shared their solo train journey experience to the festival, detailing: &quot;I went solo by train in 2023, it&#x27;s a bit of a trek but definitely doable!<br><br>&quot;I had a 40L backpack with my sleeping bag attached to it, a shopping bag with my inflatable mattress and some food on one shoulder, and my tent on the other (the Quechua ones that pack round, but now I have a normal one that packs in a cylinder which is easier to carry).<br><br>&quot;So I didn&#x27;t bring much food and booze, no chair, no portable shower (washcloth + soap +/- going once or twice at Greenpeace showers at non busy times were fine), sure it&#x27;s nice to have but I survived without all this I promise!&quot;</p></body></html>
