        <h1>A seven-day strike by immigrants would make a point</h1><p>Tackling ignorance | The best place for rioters | Unequal before the law | Worrying radio signals | Trump’s weirdness<br><br>Diane Taylor is right, but defensive in her approach (Politicians: there’s an easy remedy to the violence we’re seeing across the UK. Start telling the truth, theguardian.com, 7 August). I suggest that everyone who is an immigrant, or who has a parent or grandparent who is, downs tools for a week. Then we might begin to appreciate the part immigrants play in our lives.Stephen CrossickBarnet, London<br><br>Detaining rioters on the Bibby Stockholm is a good idea (Letters, 7 August), but it would be better to let them serve their sentence in Rwanda. On release, they could be made to make their own way home and thus experience some of the trials of those they persecute. Pete LawtonDore, South Yorkshire<br><br>I note that the “full force of the law” for violent disorder resulted in sentences of 20, 30 and 36 months (Report, 7 August). Should Just Stop Oil and others who are trying to save the world through peaceful means change their tactics? Laura CottonLondon</p>

    <p>I understand that the planned radar facility in Wales to protect the UK from “space warfare” (Deep space radar site in Wales to go ahead to protect UK from ‘space warfare’, 8 August) was proposed after radio signals from deep space were translated as “All your base are belong to us”. Worrying if true.Phil CoughlinHoughton-le-Spring, Tyne and Wear<br><br>Tim Walz was not the first to describe Donald Trump as “weird” (Opinion, 7 August). George W Bush was said to have described Trump’s inauguration speech as “some weird shit”.
