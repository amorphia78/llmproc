    <p>An engineer has narrowly avoided jail after attacking an Asda lorry with a crowbar.<br><br>Sidney Smith, 25, caused £8,000 worth of damage to the truck when he became enraged while sat in traffic caused by Just Stop Oil protesters.<br><br>He was on his way home to Brentwood, Essex, after a 12-hour night shift when he undertook the lorry and clipped it on October 18, 2022.<br><br>He got out of his car and started shouting at the Asda driver before ripping off the number plate and windscreen wiper.<br><br>He then got back into his car and started braking sharply in front of it until he caused a collision.<br><br>Prosecutor Richard Lamb said: ‘He went to the boot of his vehicle and got a red bar out and started striking the driver’s door with it, he did that four times and was shouting and was angry.<br><br>‘The lorry driver thought the window would break and he was shouting and pacing about with the bar. He then got in his vehicle again and sped off.’<br><br>Smith admitted at Maidstone Magistrates’ Court to losing it but claimed the lorry driver had clipped his car, not the other way round.<br><br>He was given a three-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months and banned from driving for 18 months.</p>
