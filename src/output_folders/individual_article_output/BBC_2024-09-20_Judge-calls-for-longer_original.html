        <h1>Judge calls for longer pregabalin supply jail terms</h1><p>A district judge in Londonderry has criticised sentences he can impose in cases involving the supply of the drug pregabalin as “totally inadequate”.<br><br>Barney McElholm made the comments as he jailed a woman involved in supplying the drug in August 2023 for two months.<br><br>The court was told a young man had later died after taking the drug and police inquiries had led them to the defendant, who cannot be named because of a court order.<br><br>The judge said the maximum sentence of three months for having the drug with intent to supply was “ludicrous”.<br><br>Sentencing at Bishop Street courthouse in Derry on Friday, Judge McElholm said: “One can&#x27;t escape the fact a young man lost his life as a result of this defendant&#x27;s activities.”<br><br>The judge said it had been “a very difficult case” and that pregabalin was one of the most dangerous drugs in circulation.<br><br>The woman, who has been granted anonymity, admitted that she supplied pregabalin, a drug used to treat a range of conditions including epilepsy and anxiety, to other people.<br><br>Mr McElholm told the court in Derry pregabalin should be seen as a class A drug, adding that Just Stop Oil protesters had been jailed for four years.</p>

    <p>The court was told police carried out a search of the woman’s property and six sheets of pregabalin were found.<br><br>She claimed that she had people drinking in her flat and that they knew where she kept the drug, the court was told.<br><br>A defence solicitor said it would be inappropriate “not to reflect on the tragic death in the case”.<br><br>He said the death of the man was a “practical example of the evil of drugs”.<br><br>The judge said the courts had to send out a message but that his sentencing powers were “totally inadequate”.<br><br>Pregabalin is used to treat conditions including epilepsy, nerve pain and anxiety on the NHS.<br><br>It comes as tablets, capsules or in liquid form, and may be called Alzain, Axalid or Lyrica, depending on the brand.<br><br>Prescription rates are showing signs of levelling off, across the UK, but doctors say it can be a very useful treatment for patients when taken correctly, and should remain available.</p></body></html>
