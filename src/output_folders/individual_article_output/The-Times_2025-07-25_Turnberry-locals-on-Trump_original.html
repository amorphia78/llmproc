    <p>Taking the temperature from the placards during President Trump’s last visit to Scotland — variations of “Scotland against Trump” and “Trump go home” — it might seem like the country is bitterly against the president.<br><br>Yet to Turnberry, a small seaside town in South Ayrshire, it is the protesters who are the real enemy, damaging property and hijacking headlines.<br><br>The residents in the area surrounding Trump Turnberry, the first golf course the president will visit this weekend, have described their support for “Big Donald”, who once gave staff $50 tips and invited neighbours to coffee.<br><br>Irene Wright, 66, a retired council worker from Glasgow, has spent her holidays at her caravan in Maidens for the last ten years.<br><br>“I hope they don’t do all these protests because I’ll be raging,” she said, “ I want him welcomed. I like Big Donald.”<br><br>Wright praised his immigration policies, adding her fury about the Greenpeace activist who had paraglided over the golf course in 2018 “threatening” Trump from above.<br><br>“I just don’t like that it’s portrayed that Scotland doesn’t welcome him, because a lot of people do and it’s the same all over Britain,” she said.<br><br>The White House has described Trump’s visit as a “private” trip, visiting his businesses, before an official state visit in September.<br><br>• Trump’s links to Scotland — from golf courses to family history<br><br>Angela Bryce, 50, who has lived in neighbouring Maidens since April, said the protesters should leave Trump to his holiday.<br><br>“How bad is it that that man can’t just go like any normal human being and play golf? Look what he’s sacrificed to help others,” she said.<br><br>“Everything he does is positive. I mean, look at these people — they’re getting employed now because he’s here.”<br><br>Trump bought the Turnberry golf course and hotel in 2014, saving it from what one local described as the threat of “rack and ruin”. Most locals know a family or friend who is employed by the resort.<br><br>Tam Cuthill, 63, from Kirkoswald, worked as a greenkeeper at Turnberry for 38 years, retiring in 2017.<br><br>“It’s one of them ones, it’s 50/50, you either love or hate him,” he said, adding that it was the workers who were most impacted by Palestine Action spray-painting the entrance signs and poisoning grass on the green. “Staff lost hours because they had to shut the hotel,” he said, shaking his head.<br><br>Cuthill was at Turnberry when Trump bought it.<br><br>“The first thing that happened when he came — it was the Women’s Open — he stopped them playing while he came on and did his thing at the 11th green and he shook our hands and gave us all $50,” Cuthill said.<br><br>“I never found anything wrong with him as such, we complained more about some of his right-hand men. From their point of view, they wanted to be seen as authoritative in his presence.</p>

    <p>“He certainly didn’t commit to saying anything bad or anything like that, he’s more likely to shake your hand.”<br><br>Residents near Menie in Aberdeenshire, where Trump built his first Scottish golf course, have been vocal against his development, refusing to sell him their land and one flying a Mexican flag outside his home in protest. In Turnberry, however, even those who have disagreed with Trump speak favourably of him.<br><br>Christina and David Auld, who have lived in a house neighbouring the fourth tee for 32 years, declined an offer from Trump to sell their land to him.<br><br>“We thought we were just being invited up for coffee, didn’t we dear?” Christina said, adding that he drank a Coke with sweeteners. The couple did not want to sell their home.<br><br>• Trump security leaves Turnberry ‘looking like an American prison’<br><br>“He was fine,” she said, about their refusal, “and he said at the end of it, ‘I hope we can still remain friends because we’re neighbours.’ He invited us to the opening of the hotel, the opening of the golf course.”<br><br>“The last time he was here, we just sat up in the bedroom and watched him teeing off,” she added, joking that they should invite him round for tea.<br><br>Slightly further up the road lies a National Trust attraction, the 18th-century home of Souter Johnnie, immortalised by Robert Burns in the poem Tam o’ Shanter. Souter’s Inn, the restaurant, bar and ice cream shop nearby, regularly serves Turnberry guests.<br><br>Eric Trump, the president’s son whom staff described as a “lovely guy” but “quiet”, also eats there on his frequent visits to Turnberry.<br><br>A staff member at Souter’s Inn said she always spoke to golfers about Trump.<br><br>“I’m a fan. I think he says it how it is,” she said, “He’s very good to staff as well, I’ve heard good reviews from staff members, especially during Covid times as well. They say he always gives them personal tips.<br><br>“There’s obviously the unfortunate haters, like when the golf course was damaged the last time. There’s no need for that.”<br><br>A bar staff member added, “A lot of people round here would be anti-protesters because obviously they couldn’t get jobs for weeks.<br><br>“It’s meant to be his baby, that hotel is. He wants the Open there. Even the golfers would prefer it there because the golf is supposedly the best in Scotland.”<br><br>Despite the praise for Trump’s investment, many residents were indifferent to Trump’s visit. One resident described the president as “uncouth”, another said he speaks with a “childish vocabulary”.<br><br>“The main problem is because it’s a private thing, it’s not a state visit,” one local said, “It’s a holiday for him and it’s costing millions, as if he’s not got enough money, he could have paid for it himself.”</p>
