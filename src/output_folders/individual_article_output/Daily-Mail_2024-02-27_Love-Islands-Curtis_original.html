    <p>For nearly a decade, viewers have watched as men and women have &#x27;coupled up&#x27; and inevitably split on the emotional rollercoaster of Love Island.<br><br>But, it seems that producers might be set to move away from the standard cast of straight twenty-somethings who typically populate the Spanish villa, by including gay singletons for the first time.<br><br>Speaking on the Mail&#x27;s Straight to the Comments! Podcast, former islander Curtis Pritchard, 28, said he believes a more inclusive series is finally on the horizon.<br><br>&#x27;Love Island is going to I believe,&#x27; he said when asked by hosts Archie Manners and Josh Pieters about whether the show would be including gay or bisexual contestants in the future or even a &#x27;throuple&#x27; – the term for a three-way couple.<br><br>Producers had previously shut down speculation that gay islanders would appear, saying that the &#x27;format&#x27; didn&#x27;t lend itself to their inclusion.<br><br>But past islanders including 2019 winner Amber Gill and Megan Barton-Hanson have identified as bisexual while the first ever series saw the late Sophie Gradon couple up with Katie Salmon .<br><br>Gill won series five with Greg O&#x27;Shea and later began dating footballer Jen Beattie, although they split up in December after almost a year together.<br><br>It comes after producers insisted the popular dating show &#x27;is not a same sex production&#x27; but admit they&#x27;re open to introducing Love Island&#x27;s first &#x27;throuple&#x27;, given three-way relationships are &#x27;trendy&#x27; among celebrities.<br><br>Executive producer Mike Spencer told MailOnline that the format has &#x27;dictated&#x27; the show only casting straight Islanders.<br><br>He said: &#x27;The show format is more open to bisexual Islanders, but it is not a same sex production as such. The format has dictated that and we&#x27;re not going to change that right now, no.<br><br>&#x27;It&#x27;s a tricky one, I obviously work for Lifted and we make Love Island and there are other productions at ITV that cover more same sex relationships, but we will continue making this brilliant show and focus on that and the people really enjoy it still and love it.&#x27;<br><br>Pritchard, who appeared on the podcast with brother AJ, 29, competed in the fifth series of the show in 2019 and eventually finished in fourth place with Maura Higgins.<br><br>He admitted that, unlike others, he didn&#x27;t have sex during his nine-week stint in the villa and only masturbated once.<br><br>Appearing on the show at the height of its popularity, the former Dancing with the Stars professional, said that all contestants were given bodyguards upon leaving the villa and they felt as big as &#x27;Beyonce.&#x27;<br><br>&#x27;On Love Island they give you a close protection agent straight away afterwards,&#x27; he said.<br><br>&#x27;We have two each to each person when we come off because you come off that programme like you&#x27;re Beyonce.<br><br>&#x27;This is why people come off it and think that you are so amazing, you walk through the airport and there&#x27;s about 100, 200 people at the airport and they just jump on you.&#x27;<br><br>Pritchard said that this is why some contestants &#x27;get really big headed and that&#x27;s why they give you security&#x27; because &#x27;people follow us for at least a month afterwards, everywhere.&#x27;<br><br>The TV star, who has since had stints on Hollyoaks and Celebs Go Dating, said the islanders are told they are not allowed to discuss the outside world while on the show and must wait to be told when they can &#x27;pull&#x27; another islander for a chat.</p>
