    <p>PRIMARY: Louise Lancaster, a 58-year-old former special educational needs coordinator, was sentenced to four years in prison for her role in organizing M25 protests in November 2022. She rented an Airbnb safehouse for protesters and bought climbing equipment for the action that recruited 45 volunteers to climb gantries over the M25, causing massive disruption to 700,000 vehicles over four days. The protest aimed to force the government to end new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.</p>
