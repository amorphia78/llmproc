    <p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil activists, Jennifer Kowalski (28, former sustainability manager) and Cole Macdonald (22), broke into Stansted airport&#x27;s private airfield at 5am and spray-painted multiple private jets with orange paint using fire extinguishers. They targeted the same airfield where Taylor Swift&#x27;s jet had landed hours earlier, demanding the UK government commit to ending fossil fuel extraction by 2030. Both women were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.</p>
