    <p>PRIMARY: Greenpeace was ordered to pay nearly $667 million in damages for their role in 2016-2017 protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. Energy Transfer accused Greenpeace of paying protesters to unlawfully disrupt pipeline construction and spreading falsehoods about the project near Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The jury awarded damages for defamation, trespassing and conspiracy, including over $400 million in punitive damages.</p>

    <p><br><br>SECONDARY: The protests involved environmental and tribal advocacy groups who opposed the pipeline, claiming it would poison local water supply and worsen climate change.<br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The legal case centers on free speech rights, with Greenpeace calling it an attack on advocacy while Energy Transfer labeled the protests &quot;violent and destructive.&quot;<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral tone, presenting both sides&#x27; arguments without editorial commentary.</p></body></html>
