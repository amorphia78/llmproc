    <p>PRIMARY: Three Greenpeace activists (two women and one man) stole a £35,000 waxwork of French President Emmanuel Macron from Paris&#x27;s Grevin Museum by disguising themselves as staff. They then placed the figure in front of the Russian embassy, demanding France halt gas and fertiliser imports from Moscow, criticizing Macron for supporting Ukraine while allowing French firms to continue trading with Russia.<br><br>SECONDARY: No secondary protests mentioned.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article discusses the poor quality of the waxwork, which has been widely ridiculed and compared to Thunderbird puppets, with even museum staff admitting it doesn&#x27;t resemble Macron well.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral to slightly humorous tone, focusing on the unusual nature of the theft while presenting the activists&#x27; message without editorial judgment.</p>
