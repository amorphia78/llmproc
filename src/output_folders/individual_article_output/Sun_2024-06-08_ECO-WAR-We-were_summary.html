    <p>PRIMARY: In 2013, 30 Greenpeace environmentalists including five Brits targeted Russian oil company Gazprom&#x27;s drilling operation in the Barents Sea. Their plan was to attach a protest pod to the oil rig to halt production and draw attention to Arctic fossil fuel extraction. Instead, they were shot at by Russian coastguard, arrested by armed counter-terrorism soldiers on piracy charges, and jailed for two months facing 15 years in prison.<br><br>SECONDARY: The activists managed to smuggle footage out of prison in a matchbox, and Paul McCartney wrote a letter to Putin supporting their release, which helped generate international pressure.</p>
