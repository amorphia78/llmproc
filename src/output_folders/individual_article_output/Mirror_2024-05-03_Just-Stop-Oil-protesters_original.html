    <p>Just Stop Oil protesters will relax on a yoga retreat before disrupting airports this summer.<br><br>The eco campaigners plan to take a break in order to mentally prepare for their “biggest action yet”. It comes after we revealed a plot to halt flights both in the UK and Europe from mid-July.<br><br>Our reporter recently attended a meeting where 50 campaigners gathered. One said: “It’s time for us to prepare ahead of this summer. There will be yoga, meditation and time to chill out together and support each other… it’s for people who are very involved in JSO.<br><br>“Some of us will car share and I should think others will get there by train. The coming months will be a lot, and it’s important for people who’ve made the commitment to take some time out.” The group is currently crowdfunding, but it is not known if this will cover the bill for their weekend away.<br><br>Activists plan to glue themselves to runways and clamber on to planes in tourist hotspots like Spain, Greece and Turkey. Just Stop Oil ’s Phoebe Plummer was applauded as she discussed the “summer strategy” at the event in Central London this week.</p>

    <p>The 22-year-old told the meeting: “Flights operate on such a tight schedule to control air traffic… we’re talking about disruption on a scale that has never been seen before. It’s time to wake up and get real – no summer holiday is more important than food security, housing and the lives of your loved ones. Flying is also a symbol of wealth inequality and if we want to create change, we need to adopt a more radical demand.”<br><br>Just Stop Oil said: “We have had runaway record temperatures the last 10 months. Meanwhile, the High Court has declared the Government’s climate policy unlawful for the second time. Politics is failing and it’s time we step into action to do something about it.”</p>
