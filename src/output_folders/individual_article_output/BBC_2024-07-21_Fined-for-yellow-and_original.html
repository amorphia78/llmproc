    <p>Dissent is not tolerated in Vladimir Putin&#x27;s Russia.<br><br>For years Kremlin critics have faced a host of laws which could be used against them, and since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that toolbox of measures has swelled in size.<br><br>The laws target basic rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly - even though they are enshrined in Russia&#x27;s constitution.<br><br>The repressive nature of the punishments, often disproportionate to the offence, harks back to the methods of the old Soviet Union.<br><br>The law used most widely against critics of the war in Ukraine is the criminal offence of spreading &quot;deliberately false information&quot; about the Russian army.<br><br>It was rushed through parliament shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was &quot;urgently needed because of the absolutely unprecedented information war waged against our country&quot;.<br><br>According to prominent Russian human rights group OVD-Info, more than 300 people have since been charged or convicted under it.<br><br>Even though the law mentions &quot;false&quot; information, it has been used against people  who highlight crimes that are well-documented but denied by Russia.<br><br>Ilya Yashin is one of the most high-profile critics of the war to be convicted under this law. The former head of a Moscow disctrict council was given eight and half years in jail for a live stream on YouTube in which he urged an investigation into the murder of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.<br><br>In April 2023, prominent opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail on charges of treason and spreading &quot;false information&quot; about the Russian army.<br><br>His case was partly based on a speech in which he accused Russian troops in Ukraine of committing war crimes by using cluster bombs in residential areas and bombing maternity hospitals and schools.<br><br>The law has also been applied to Russians with far smaller public profiles.<br><br>Russian-language tutor Raisa Boldova, 61, was handed a suspended one-year community service sentence for posting critical comments about attacks on civilians in Ukraine, including the bombing of the Mariupol maternity hospital.<br><br>In an echo of a chilling Soviet practice of confining dissidents to mental hospitals, the court also ordered her to undergo a compulsory psychiatric evaluation.<br><br>Another recent law penalises &quot;discrediting&quot; the Russian army, and it has been applied to a broad variety of actions interpreted either as support for Ukraine or criticism of the war.<br><br>These include:<br><br>A village priest in Kostroma region was fined for discrediting Russia&#x27;s armed forces after praying for peace and mentioning the sixth commandment, &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;.<br><br>Russia&#x27;s &quot;foreign agents&quot; law allows restrictions to be imposed on critics without convicting them of any wrongdoing.<br><br>Individuals or organisations that have criticised or scrutinised government policies are targeted if they are deemed to have received money from abroad - even from a relative - or merely to be under &quot;foreign influence&quot;.</p>

    <p>The label has to be attached to all public communications, a practice designed to undermine trust in them and one that resembles the Soviet practice of branding dissidents &quot;enemies of the people&quot;.<br><br>Among Russia&#x27;s &quot;foreign agents&quot; are election monitor Golos, prominent pollster Levada Centre, rights group OVD-Info, a movement of wives of mobilised soldiers called The Way Home and numerous independent news websites and journalists including Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov.<br><br>Books written by so-called foreign agents have started to disappear from shops and libraries.<br><br>A &quot;foreign agent&quot; label can make life difficult – but being declared &quot;undesirable&quot; amounts to an outright ban.<br><br>All manner of organisations have been banned from Russia in this way – from the NGO Greenpeace to London-based think-tank Chatham House, as well as a number of key Russian media outlets.<br><br>Late opposition leader Alexei Navalny&#x27;s Anti-Corruption Foundation was disbanded after being declared “extremist” – another label used to effectively erase individuals and organisations from public life.<br><br>Navalny himself was handed a lengthy prison sentence and died in jail in February 2024. His widow says he was killed by President Putin. Several of Navalny&#x27;s lawyers were themselves arrested on charges of extremism.<br><br>In Russia, anyone who wishes to hold a demonstration needs permission from the authorities. If the rally is critical of the government, that is practically impossible.<br><br>&quot;One-person pickets&quot; are allowed, but many are regularly shut down - ostensibly because of Covid restrictions.<br><br>One man was fined for wearing blue-and-yellow shoes - seen as a violation of laws regulating political demonstrations. And a journalist from Vologda Region, Antonida Smolina, was visited by police after someone complained about photographs she had posted online showing her posing in a yellow coat against a blue sky.<br><br>Other actions outlawed in Russia include &quot;disrespect&quot; for the authorities and calls for sanctions to be imposed on the country.<br><br>According to Natalia Prilutskaya of Amnesty International, the Kremlin uses laws to “legitimise repression”, partly by exploiting the vague wording of some Russian laws.<br><br>&quot;This vagueness allows law enforcement structures to qualify basically any activity as a forbidden activity, or at least it makes it easier,&quot; Ms Prilutskaya told the BBC.<br><br>Dmitrii Anisimov, spokesman for Russian human rights group OVD-Info, argues that laws are a particularly important for the Kremlin because of the way Russia&#x27;s security apparatus functions.<br><br>&quot;The Russian security community is fairly bureaucratic and it needs legal norms for their actions,” he said. Legislation used by the security services had been “deliberately designed in a way that makes their application simple and widespread”, he added.<br><br>Ms Prilutskaya says it all adds up to a general climate of repression, which she blames on President Vladimir Putin.<br><br>&quot;The ambitions of one person have brought Russia to the edge of a really deep abyss,” she said.</p>
