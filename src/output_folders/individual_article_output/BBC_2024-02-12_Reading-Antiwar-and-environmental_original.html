    <p>In response to this, Adam who was in Reading campaigning with Extinction Rebellion, said: &quot;We&#x27;ve moved the needle as it were, and we can now continue to put pressure, to get them to tighten up the statements, and improve their strategy.<br><br>&quot;But yeah, it feels like a win for activism.&quot;<br><br>Unconnected protestors in Reading, and at other branches, were highlighting the bank&#x27;s links with defence companies.<br><br>Razwan is one of the activists, he said: &quot;Ask the banks themselves, because of their ethical reporting, they have to report on this, and it&#x27;s there very clearly, that they&#x27;re investing in weapons companies.<br><br>&quot;Those weapons are killing civilians.&quot;<br><br>Barclays says it has clear policies on investments in defence, what it will and will not support.<br><br>Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.
