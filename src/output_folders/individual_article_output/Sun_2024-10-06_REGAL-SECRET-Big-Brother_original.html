    <p>The 24-year-old, who protests for Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, said: “I’m looking forward to living in a community.<br><br>“My work is about learning to set parameters that end up benefiting everyone. This show is a micro version of that.”<br><br>Former Page Three girl and soap actress Emma Morgan, 53, has also signed up to the show.<br><br>She said: “To get this opportunity at my age, I wasn’t expecting it. I was getting ready to put my feet up and do a bit of knitting.”<br><br>And amputee footballer Thomas Atkinson, 20, from Carlisle, comes to the house fresh from captaining his side to victory in the FA Disability Cup.<br><br>The goalkeeper, who was born without a left hand, was also told he would never walk after having his left leg amputated when he was two. But he now has a total of 26 caps with the England Amputee national team.</p>
