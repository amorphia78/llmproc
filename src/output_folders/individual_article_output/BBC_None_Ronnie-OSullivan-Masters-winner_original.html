        <h1>Ronnie O'Sullivan: Masters winner responds angrily after being criticised by Ali Carter</h1><p>Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan has called Ali Carter &quot;not a nice person&quot; and &quot;a nightmare&quot; to play against after being criticised by the beaten Masters finalist.<br><br>On Sunday, O&#x27;Sullivan rallied from 6-3 down to beat Carter 10-7 and win a record-extending eighth Masters title.<br><br>Afterwards, Carter accused the world number one of &quot;snotting&quot; - clearing his nose - &quot;all over the floor&quot;.<br><br>A World Snooker Tour spokesperson said the whole incident between the two players was &quot;under review&quot;.<br><br>The WST did not go into what the ramifications could be or a timeframe.<br><br>On Tuesday, O&#x27;Sullivan beat Pang Junxu of China 4-2 at the World Grand Prix in Leicester.<br><br>Following the win, world number one O&#x27;Sullivan told ITV he will &quot;definitely be missing a few tournaments&quot; after this.<br><br>&quot;I shouldn&#x27;t even really have come here to be honest, but it is alright so I thought I would just turn up. In hindsight, I shouldn&#x27;t have come,&quot; he added.<br><br>&quot;I would like to think if I fell off the tour I might get a wildcard, but knowing World Snooker they would probably say no.<br><br>&quot;I am just trying to keep my tour card really, that&#x27;s all I am trying to do.<br><br>&quot;I am not bothered about tournaments, it is not my favourite bit to be fair.&quot;<br><br>Pair appear in court over Just Stop Oil protest at World Championship<br><br>O&#x27;Sullivan fights back to beat Carter 10-7 for eighth title<br><br>Beaten Carter criticises &#x27;morons&#x27; in Masters crowd<br><br>In response to Carter&#x27;s comments after the Masters final, O&#x27;Sullivan said: &quot;He [Carter] has got issues. He&#x27;s got to go and sort his life out.<br><br>&quot;He&#x27;s got to go and see a counsellor or something. He&#x27;s got to deal with that because that isn&#x27;t any good.&quot;<br><br>Carter, 44, criticised &quot;some morons&quot; in the crowd at Alexandra Palace in London and also called out 48-year-old O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s behaviour during the match.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s just disgusting, no one wants to say anything though do they?&quot; said Carter.<br><br>&quot;Snotting all over the floor and all that, it&#x27;s outrageous behaviour from a top professional and if it gets swept under the carpet then it&#x27;s not good.&quot;</p><p>O&#x27;Sullivan has now won 23 of his 26 matches against Carter, including victories in the 2008 and 2012 World Championship finals.<br><br>Carter did beat his fellow Englishman in the second round of the same tournament in 2018 when they were involved in a &quot;shoulder barge&quot; incident during the match.<br><br>&quot;I don&#x27;t talk to him. I haven&#x27;t spoken to him for 20 years. I played with him when he was a kid, shared a lot of stuff with him,&quot; said O&#x27;Sullivan, who swore repeatedly in his response.<br><br>&quot;For him to come out and trash talk me like that, everybody knows what he&#x27;s like, he&#x27;s got issues. Why has he got issues with me? I&#x27;m not having it. I don&#x27;t care.<br><br>&quot;I will not skirt around it any more, tiptoeing on egg shells around someone like that.<br><br>&quot;He&#x27;s a nightmare. To have to play snooker against someone like that is a nightmare. [He&#x27;s] not a nice person, not a nice vibe that he leaves around the table.<br><br>&quot;That&#x27;s it, I&#x27;ve said my piece. I&#x27;ve said it now, done.&quot;<br><br>Carter hit back again on Tuesday, telling ITV: &quot;Ronnie is entitled to his opinion. I just said what it is and how it was and I talk facts. It is as simple as that.<br><br>&quot;It makes no difference to me what he says - he says different things on different days. I don&#x27;t think he even knows what is going to come out of his mouth at certain times.<br><br>&quot;I actually feel a bit sorry for him. I don&#x27;t think he is that well. So we move forward and we go again this week.&quot;<br><br>Former world champion Ken Doherty said the ongoing row was not a good look for the sport.<br><br>Speaking on ITV4&#x27;s coverage of this week&#x27;s Grand Prix event, Doherty said: &quot;There is history behind it with the shoulder barge at the World Championship and it goes from there.<br><br>&quot;It is bad blood and [O&#x27;Sullivan] was reacting to what Ali said in the press conference as well.<br><br>&quot;I am sure World Snooker will review it and we&#x27;ll see what happens, but not great headlines really.&quot;</p></body></html>
