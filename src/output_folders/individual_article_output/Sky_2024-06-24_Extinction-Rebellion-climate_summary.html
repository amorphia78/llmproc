    <p>PRIMARY: Six Extinction Rebellion activists stormed the 18th green during the final moments of the Travellers Championship PGA tournament in Connecticut, spraying colored smoke and powder while wearing &quot;NO GOLF ON A DEAD PLANET&quot; T-shirts. The protesters were tackled by police and arrested, causing a five-minute delay. The group demanded strong climate action, arguing that golf&#x27;s weather dependence should make fans understand the need for immediate environmental measures.</p>
