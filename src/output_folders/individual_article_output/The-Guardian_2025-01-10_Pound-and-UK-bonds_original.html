    <p>Plunging temperatures and high demand for gas fired power stations have reduced UK winter gas storage levels, reports Centrica<br><br>Newsflash: the US economy added many more jobs than expected last month, a development that has hammered the pound.<br><br>Non-farm payrolls rose by 256,000 in December, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported today. That smashes forecasts of a 160,00 increase, and has pulled the US unemployment rate down to 4.1%, from 4.2%.<br><br>Employment trended up in health care, government, and social assistance, and retailers also added jobs in December, the BLS reports.<br><br>This indicates the US labor market is in a stronger position than expected – good news for Donald Trump as he prepares to be sworn in as US president later this month.<br><br>BUT it will make it harder for the US Federal Reserve to justify cuts to interest rates.<br><br>As a result, the dollar is rallying – and this has sent the pound plunging by a whole cent to $1.22, the lowest since November 2023.<br><br>The dollar index after #NFP report. pic.twitter.com/3G8WnPgcnN<br><br>A highly volatile week in the market is now over.<br><br>It’s been a tough few days for the pound, which has fallen by 2.3% against the US dollar so far this month, to around $1.222 tonight.<br><br>UK bonds have been pounded too – Reuters calculated earlier that 10-year gilt yields have risen more than 28 basis points this week, the biggest weekly rise since May 2023.<br><br>Those losses were driven by concerns over the UK’s fiscal outlook, as well as international influences.<br><br>And it was the latter that hit UK markets this afternoon, after stronger-than expected US jobs figures triggered volatile conditions in global financial markets.<br><br>In an accelerating global bond market sell-off, investors warned that the UK was particularly exposed amid growing fears over stubbornly high inflation and higher for longer interest rates. Almost 700,000 UK homeowners are facing an increase in mortgage costs when their fixed-rate deals end this year.<br><br>At the end of a turbulent week in global markets, bond yields rose sharply for governments worldwide, before falling back, after the last jobs report of the Biden administration showed the US labour market grew strongly in December.<br><br>In other news… the UK government has insisted the country has enough gas and electricity to meet demand this winter.<br><br>The pledge came after the owner of the country’s largest gas stores said levels had become “concerningly low” amid the current cold snap.<br><br>Centrica, which also owns British Gas, said on Friday that its inventories had fallen by half since early November, to a quarter below where gas storage levels were at the same time last year when temperatures were milder than normal.<br><br>The company blamed the decline to less than a week’s worth of gas – its full storage is the equivalent of 12 days of average use – on the early start to a colder than normal winter across the UK and high prices in the global wholesale market.<br><br>Britain’s blue-chip share index has closed for the week, down almost 0.9% today.<br><br>The FTSE 100 share index fell 71 points to finish at 8248 points.<br><br>Financial group Schroders was the top faller, down 4.3%, followed by Sainsbury’s (-4.2%), drinks firm Diageo (-4.2%) and insurer Beazley (-4.2%).<br><br>The UK Treasury could be cheered by some of the analysis being issued by City experts this afternoon.<br><br>First up, Deutsche Bank have told clients that they don’t think the UK has an imminent problem with debt sustainability (which is a relief!).<br><br>Their chief UK economist Sanjay Raja writes:<br><br>Does the UK have an imminent debt sustainability problem? We think not. While the UK has led the bond sell-off, bond markets globally have seen yields surge higher over the last few months. Put differently, it is not just a UK phenomenon.<br><br>However, Raja does believe Rachel Reeves will face “hard choice” later this year to keep within her fiscal rules.<br><br>Over at Capital Economics, chief UK economist Paul Dales says the gilt market is “not in crisis”, writing:<br><br>This week’s leap in gilt yields creates more problems for the Chancellor and is an extra headwind for the economy. But it is not a crisis and the cause mostly originates overseas rather than being home-grown.<br><br>Shares in US insurance companies have dropped, amid forecasts that the wildfires ravaging Los Angeles could be the costliest disaster in California’s history.<br><br>Insurer Travelers fell nearly 3% in morning trading. Los Angeles-based multi-line insurer Mercury General slumped 17%, while Allstate, Chubb and AIG dropped between 2% and 4%.<br><br>The sell-off came as estimates of the economic damage from the fires rose to $52bn-$57bn.<br><br>Consumer advocates and veterans of past disasters have warned that homeowners can expect weeks or months of paperwork to prove that they have lost what they say they have lost, and pressure to settle for less than they are entitled to.<br><br>Elsewhere in the energy market, oil is rallying too.<br><br>The price of Brent crude has risen by 3.7% today to $79.72 per barrel, the highest level since October.<br><br>The rise comes after Joe Biden’s administration imposed its broadest package of sanctions yet targeting Russia’s oil and gas revenues.<br><br>A senior Biden official told reporters in a call that the measures are:<br><br>“the most significant sanctions yet against the Russian energy sector, the largest source of revenue for the Kremlin’s war machine.”<br><br>The move is meant to cut Russia’s oil revenues for the Ukrainian war which is nearing its third anniversary.<br><br>The sanction apply to Russian companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas that explore, produce and sell oil, and 183 vessels that have shipped Russian oil, many of which are in the so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers operated by non-Western companies.<br><br>They also include networks that trade oil.<br><br>UK gas prices have risen today, following Centrica’s warning that storage levels are low.<br><br>The day-ahead price of UK gas is now up 1.25% at 112.9p per therm, having earlier fallen in four of the five previous days.<br><br>Gas for delivery next month is up 1.7%.<br><br>The solution to the UK’s gas storage squeeze is to use less gas, Greenpeace argues.<br><br>UK’s policy director, Doug Parr, said:<br><br>“The best way to increase the UK’s energy resilience and risks related to strained gas supplies is to get off gas. A fully renewable energy system, with sufficient storage, wouldn’t encounter these issues and, more importantly, it would cut emissions helping to tackle the climate crisis.<br><br>Parr also smells a gassy rat when he hears Centrica’s call for more gas storage:<br><br>“We should be wary of Centrica’s attempts to boost concern about gas storage. The UK has relied on European gas stores via the interconnectors for many years - stores that are reasonably full. Centrica is seeking taxpayer cash to do up their gas storage site in East Yorkshire and will be happy to use this moment to point out its advantages. Let’s not panic.”<br><br>Worryingly, US consumers’ long-term inflation expectations have jumped to the highest since 2008, according to the University of Michigan’s latest sentiment survey.</p>

While the ongoing resilience in the job market is welcomed, markets have recently shifted to focus more on inflation concerns and rising bond yields. The exceptionally strong US jobs gain in December, together with the prospect of pro-growth policies and tariffs by the Trump administration, will exacerbate concerns on inflation. This casts doubt on whether the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates at all in 2025. The rise in bond yields also caused some nervousness in the equity market, even though a strong economy is good for corporate profits.<br><br>This is further bad news for the UK Chancellor, as UK bond yields further rose alongside global yields today. While the moves are affected by US data, the rise in borrowing costs will put further strain on UK’s fiscal position and hence attract intensifying scrutiny on the government.<br><br>The initial knee-jerk market reaction to the US jobs report is subsiding, somewhat.<br><br>The pound has recovered to $1.225, down half a cent today, having dropped below $1.22 when the US payroll report hit the wires.<br><br>UK bond yields are dipping back too, although both 10-year and 30-year gilt yields are still higher today, up around 3 basis points (0.03 percentage points).<br><br>The US labor market expanded strongly in the last jobs report of the Biden administration, according to new data released on Friday.<br><br>The number of new jobs added to the economy accelerated to 256,000 in December, up from 227,000 in November, soaring past expectations. The labor market last month was bolstered by new jobs in healthcare, retail and government.<br><br>As the final jobs report of his administration, it’s a blowout for Joe Biden, who struggled to rally support around his economic agenda despite the economy strengthening after the pandemic.<br><br>Other data points released in the last week pointed to strength in the labor market. The Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (Jolts) showed that job openings topped 8m in November, soaring past expectations.<br><br>Another report from outsourcing firm Challeger, Gray &amp; Christmas reported a 33% decrease in layoffs in private firms in December, going from around 57,000 cuts in November to 38,000 layoffs in December.<br><br>The market reaction to today’s strong US jobs report is a sign that the peak in government bond yields has not been reached, yet, warns Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.<br><br>That is bad news for the UK, as Shah explains:<br><br>“The important payroll beat will be good news for the U.S. economy and the US dollar, unwelcome news for equities as they seek interest rate relief, and punishing news for global bond markets, particularly UK gilts.<br><br>U.S. labor market strength is clearly a continuing theme and suggests that the economy continues to thrive. The Fed can be very comfortable staying put in January and will need some meaningful downside inflation surprises or reversals in upcoming jobs reports to wake them from rate slumber in March.<br><br>For global bonds, the strength of the U.S. jobs report just adds to their challenges. The peak for yields has not yet been reached, suggesting additional stresses that several markets, especially the UK, can ill afford.”<br><br>The strong dollar has jumped to a six-month high against Japan’s yen, touching ¥158.8 to the $.<br><br>US government debt prices are also falling, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on America’s debt.<br><br>The 10-year Treasury yield is up almost 10 basis points at 4.78%, while 30-year Treasury yields are 7bps higher.<br><br>⚖️*EUROPEAN BONDS  FALL WITH TREASURIES AFTER US PAYROLLS🔻*GOLD PARES GAINS AFTER STRONG US DECEMBER JOBS DATA⚖️🇺🇸*US 2- TO 7-YEAR YIELDS RISE AT LEAST 10 BASIS POINTS ON DAY💱*EM CURRENCIES SLIDE AFTER US JOBS REPORT; BRL, ZAR LEAD LOSSES💷🔻*GBP/UDS FALLS 0.7% TO…<br><br>This rather confirms what Sir John Gieve told the Today Programme this morning, that UK borrowing costs are moving in sync with the US.<br><br>The UK bond market crisis is bursting back into life too.<br><br>UK bond yields have jumped as investors calculate that the strong US jobs report reduces the chances of interest rates cuts in America, and quite possibly the UK too.<br><br>The yield on 30-year UK gilts has gained another 7 basis points (0.07 percentage points) today to 5.437%, towards the 26-year high seen on Thursday.<br><br>Ten-year gilt prices are also weakening, driving up yields on those bonds by 8 basis points to 4.88%, near to the highest since 2008.<br><br>Newsflash: the US economy added many more jobs than expected last month, a development that has hammered the pound.<br><br>Non-farm payrolls rose by 256,000 in December, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported today.
