    <p>Slipping off my robe, only one thought entered my mind.<br><br>‘S**t! I should have shaved.’<br><br>It was a silly thought for a number of reasons.<br><br>One – because I loved my bush. I’d never been one to care about priming myself or hair removal.<br><br>And two – I was stripping off for a naked photo shoot.<br><br>I was in a room full of people who I’d never have to see again. So what did I care if they saw my wild pubic hair?<br><br>Besides, in just a few months’ time my naked body would be on full display in my local weekly newspaper, and I couldn’t wait.<br><br>At 46 I was making a statement: I will not conform. I love my body. And yes, I am allowed to pose naked, no matter what you think.<br><br>Up until then, I had spent most of my life obsessing over my body.<br><br>In high school, having moved across the country with my dad after my parents’ divorce, I’d taken up cycling.<br><br>I became obsessed with the sport, or more accurately, loved that I could drop pant sizes effortlessly.<br><br>When I visited my mother a year later, she wrapped her arms around me and cried.<br><br>I had lost 20 pounds or more and a mother knows when something’s wrong.<br><br>If you suspect you, a family member or friend has an eating disorder, contact Beat on 0808 801 0677 or at help@beateatingdisorders.org.uk, for information and advice on the best way to get appropriate treatment<br><br>During our visit, my mom bought a video on eating disorders and made me watch it.<br><br>Out loud, I denied everything in the video – but inside my head, I checked off many of the boxes.<br><br>I wasn’t ready to give it up trying to lose weight, though.<br><br>I was still relentless and it didn’t take long for the happiness I felt at losing the weight to be replaced by an overwhelming dislike for my muscular thighs.<br><br>I hated not being able to fit into those stupid skinny jeans. I wore skirts that hid my legs and baggy clothes in general to hide myself away.<br><br>Things only got worse as I entered my twenties. I under ate; over ate; obsessed about calories.<br><br>The whole time, I cycled.<br><br>After graduating from journalism school in my early 30s, cycling became the way I saw the world.<br><br>It became my livelihood as I forged a career as a travel writer specialising in cycling – riding up mountains throughout Europe, and Peruvian peaks in incredibly thin air.<br><br>Those critical thoughts about my body disappeared on these trips.<br><br>But back home, I obsessed over gaining a few pounds – and it ruined my day; destroyed my confidence.<br><br>Gradually, I started to see my body as my instrument<br><br>By my mid 30s, the relationship with my body was still no better.<br><br>I wasn’t looking after myself.<br><br>I recall being near Paris in 2016 when my legs turned to concrete. I couldn’t move.<br><br>Realising I hadn’t eaten that day, I panicked – I was alone and my cycling trip in Europe had just begun – I couldn’t go on like this for months.<br><br>If I was going to ride, I had to eat.<br><br>Gradually, from that moment on, I started to see my body as my instrument. I had to nurture it.<br><br>And, slowly, things started to change.<br><br>When I joined a women’s only bike group in Canada in 2015 and started seeing how other women trained, joking about wobbly bits they didn’t like, it helped.<br><br>They were strong and healthy and enjoyed life – and I wanted to see my body in the way they saw theirs. Doing so allowed me to live more fully.<br><br>I participated in my first mountain bike race in 2015 and hearing the screams of friends as I pushed myself, exhausted and sweating across the finish line, was amazing.<br><br>But more incredible than that was the fact that I came in second.<br><br>‘You’re stronger than you think,’ my future husband told me. And he was right.<br><br>So in 2018, not long after the race and  just after turning  46, when I saw a call out from a local magazine asking people for their body stories, complete with a naked photoshoot, I knew I had to get involved.<br><br>I was finally ready to celebrate my body. No more slagging it off or comparing it to others’.<br><br>This would be a great way to share what I’d come through, and that now, I saw my body for what it was. Mine.<br><br>I had never felt stronger or more emotionally secure in how I looked and what I had become.<br><br>Those legs had pedalled thousands of miles, taking me through dozens of countries<br><br>Of course, that didn’t stop me from being nervous when I walked in the room.</p>

    <p>Because it wasn’t only the shape and size of my body that had become an obsession.<br><br>Around the time my mother died in 2017, I began suffering from psoriasis.<br><br>A giant red rash developed over both my legs and it made me horribly self conscious, especially in the summer months.<br><br>If I wore a skirt or shorts, I was convinced that people would be staring at the red splotches as I walked down the street.<br><br>At first I was angry.<br><br>But after a while, I became immune to their stares and trained myself to ignore them.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
