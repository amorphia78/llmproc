    <p>PRIMARY: Ten Greenpeace activists abseiled off the Forth Road Bridge to protest against the Ineos tanker Independence carrying fracked gas to Grangemouth. The protesters suspended themselves 25m above the shipping lane with red banners, blocking deep water vessel access. They demand governments cut global plastic production by 75% by 2040 and oppose Ineos allegedly sabotaging upcoming UN plastics treaty negotiations.<br><br>SECONDARY: No secondary protest actions mentioned.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article discusses the broader context of failed UN plastics treaty negotiations in South Korea and upcoming talks in Geneva, where Greenpeace claims the plastics industry will send hundreds of lobbyists while Ineos says only two representatives.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral tone, presenting both Greenpeace&#x27;s environmental concerns and Ineos&#x27;s counterarguments about job protection and practical solutions.</p>
