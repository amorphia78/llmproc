    <p>PRIMARY: Two elderly women, Rev Dr Sue Parfitt (82) and retired biology teacher Judy Bruce (85), were arrested after chipping the display case of Magna Carta at the British Library with a hammer and chisel while holding a banner reading &quot;The government is breaking the law.&quot; The Just Stop Oil action resulted in £2,000 in criminal damage charges. The protesters demand government action on climate change and want to stop North Sea drilling.<br><br>SECONDARY: The pair previously unfurled a banner during a thanksgiving service at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral reading &quot;Will our children thank us?&quot; and met while &quot;sitting in front of an oil tanker.&quot;</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article explores how these respectable elderly women became radical climate activists later in life, their Christian motivations, and public criticism of Just Stop Oil&#x27;s disruptive tactics.<br><br>TONE: The article takes a sympathetic, humanizing tone toward the protesters, portraying them as principled individuals driven by genuine concern for humanity&#x27;s future.</p>
