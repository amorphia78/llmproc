        <h1>Charges against 34 people dropped over plastic pollution protest at Unilever HQ</h1><p>PRIMARY: Thirty-four Greenpeace activists had criminal charges dropped for blockading Unilever&#x27;s London headquarters in September, protesting the company&#x27;s alleged failure to tackle plastic pollution. Eight faced aggravated trespass charges and 26 faced &quot;locking on&quot; charges under new legislation. Activists climbed the building, attached artwork, blocked entrances, and locked themselves to large Dove product models.<br><br>SECONDARY: The protest was part of Greenpeace&#x27;s ongoing campaign against Unilever after the company rolled back plastic reduction targets.</p>
