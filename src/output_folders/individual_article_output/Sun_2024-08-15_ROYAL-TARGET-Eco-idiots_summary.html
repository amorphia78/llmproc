    <p>PRIMARY: Extinction Rebellion activists are planning to storm Windsor Castle grounds from August 30 to September 1, creating a diversion on The Long Walk to break into private royal grounds while also targeting Windsor town centre hotels, restaurants, and blocking roads. The protest, called &quot;Upgrade Democracy,&quot; demands a Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Climate and Ecological Justice and targets what they call a &quot;broken and unjust system,&quot; though the King won&#x27;t be present during the demonstration.</p>

    <p><br><br>SECONDARY: The article mentions XR&#x27;s previous actions including gluing themselves to buildings, blocking streets, and blockading Amazon depots.<br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article discusses XR&#x27;s finances, revealing they earned £1.5million but paid only £1,039 in tax, and notes the irony of protesting the environmentally-conscious King Charles.<br><br>TONE: The article is strongly negative, using derogatory terms like &quot;eco idiots,&quot; &quot;zealots,&quot; and &quot;rabble&quot; throughout.</p>
