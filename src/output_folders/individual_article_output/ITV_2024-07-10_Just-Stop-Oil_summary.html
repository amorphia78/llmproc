    <p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil activists disrupted the World Snooker Championship at Sheffield&#x27;s Crucible Theatre, with Eddie Whittingham (26-year-old energy adviser) mounting a table and covering it with orange powder, while Margaret Reid (53-year-old ex-museum worker) attempted the same on another table. They caused Â£900 in criminal damage and received community orders with 300 hours of unpaid work between them, avoiding prison sentences.</p>

    <p><br><br>SECONDARY: No secondary protest actions mentioned.<br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The court proceedings focused on the commercial impact beyond the physical damage, with the judge noting the international nature of the tournament and millions of viewers affected.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral tone, presenting both the activists&#x27; justifications and the court&#x27;s criticism equally.</p></body></html>
