        <h1>UK risks ‘descending into darkness’ of antisemitism, Michael Gove to say</h1><p>Safety of Jewish community ‘canary in mine’ for British political system, communities secretary will warn in speech<br><br>Michael Gove is to warn that Britain risks “descending into the darkness” if it fails to tackle growing antisemitism in the wake of the 7 October attacks.<br><br>In a major speech, the communities secretary will say the safety of the Jewish community in the UK is the “canary in the mine” for the health of the whole political system.<br><br>“When Jewish people are under threat, all our freedoms are threatened,” he will say on Tuesday. “The safety of the Jewish community is the canary in the mine.<br><br>“Growing antisemitism is a fever which weakens the whole body politic. There is one thing which – increasingly – unites the organisations and individuals which give cause for extremist concern: antisemitism.<br><br>“It is the common currency of hate. It is at the dark heart of their worldview. Whether Islamist, far right or hard left.”<br><br>The Community Security Trust, a charity that provides security advice to the Jewish community, recorded the highest number of antisemitic incidents in 2023, a 147% increase on the previous year. About two-thirds of the total took place after the 7 October attacks.<br><br>In his speech, Gove will criticise the organisers of pro-Palestine marches, at which thousands of people regularly march through London and other cities, for not doing more to prevent symbols of anti-Jewish hate.<br><br>“Many of those on these marches are thoughtful, gentle, compassionate people – driven by a desire for peace and an end to suffering,” he will say. “But they are side by side with those who are promoting hate.<br><br>“The organisers of these marches could do everything in their power to stop that. They don’t.”<br><br>The marches have been overwhelmingly peaceful, however, police made seven arrests at the latest protest in London on Saturday, including a demonstrator seen carrying a coffin with offensive language on it. The demonstration came a few days after Nakba Day, which honours the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war.</p>

    <p>Gove, who is regarded as one of parliament’s most pro-Israel MPs, will urge peers to back his bill banning British public bodies from boycotting Israel, a move that some Tories have said could exacerbate British community tensions amid the Israel-Hamas war.<br><br>He makes the speech before the publication of a report by the government’s independent adviser on political violence, Lord Walney, due to be released on Tuesday, which is expected to recommend a new category for proscribing “extreme protest groups”.<br><br>Sign up to First Edition<br><br>Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters<br><br>after newsletter promotion<br><br>At the launch of his report, he will say: “It is time for the political world to catch up with the real world and view extreme protest movements as an unacceptable threat to our democracy, not an extension of it.”<br><br>Walney, the former Labour MP John Woodcock who sits as a cross-bench peer, said at the weekend that hard-left groups were seeking to “undermine” Britain’s democratic principles by refusing to comply with the law.<br><br>His recommendations could mean that protest groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action, which focuses on arms companies linked to Israel, could be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations. The sanctions could restrict a group’s ability to fundraise and its right to assembly.<br><br>The Home Office has said ministers would consider the recommendations, but it is unclear whether the government would proceed with a ban before the election. It is due to publish its counter-extremism action plan in the coming weeks.</p></body></html>
