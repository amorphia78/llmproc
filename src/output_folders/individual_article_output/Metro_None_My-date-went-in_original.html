    <p>There were plenty of photos on Frank’s* profile of nights out and days in nature.<br><br>They weren’t exactly high resolution, some even a little blurry, and I couldn’t tell how old they were, but I wasn’t particularly phased.<br><br>As a naïve newbie to internet dating, doubt never crossed my mind. He claimed to be around six foot and of medium build, and from what I could see, he had mod-ish, dark, glossy hair, sparkling eyes and a magnetic smile.<br><br>Frank and I got chatting online.<br><br>He was funny, interested in what I had to say, and after a few days, when he asked me on a date, I agreed. We had an initial connection and good banter.<br><br>My heart and confidence had taken a knock from a recent long-term relationship breakup. I always knew that I wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but for someone, I was perfect and I wasn’t going to give up on finding my other half.<br><br>I hoped Frank could be the one.<br><br>For first dates, I would always take my car and drink soft drinks or tea. There was a nice bar, not far from the centre of town that I liked as a venue: it was spacious, stylish, and felt safe, with plenty of parking spaces, so we arranged to meet there.<br><br>I had the nervous excitement we’ve all experienced on a first date. Would I like him? Would he like me? Would we click in person like we had with the click of a mouse?<br><br>Love reading juicy stories like this?

We can&#x27;t wait for you to join us!<br><br>Walking in, I saw him standing near the entrance of the bar, in the clothes he said he’d be wearing.<br><br>This was a completely different man to the one I’d seen in pictures. If he was the same person, he was certainly worse for wear.<br><br>My heart sank, and I immediately felt cheated and deflated – like I had bought a tub of Quality Streets and only found four purple ones amongst a sea of toffee pennies.<br><br>Not my type, I’m afraid.<br><br>Why can’t people can’t just be honest? I thought.<br><br>It’s hard enough putting yourself out there and exposing yourself to the vulnerabilities of dating.<br><br>I get that we all have confidence issues at times, and I absolutely knew I was far from perfect. But lying to such an obvious extreme – it was frustrating, time-wasting, and a massive let down.<br><br>Of course, it didn’t help that it wasn’t in my nature to call someone out for embellishing reality a little, or a lot!<br><br>So, I gritted my teeth and walked towards him. I greeted Frank with a pleasant hello and smile and we walked to the bar together to order a drink.<br><br>Reaching the bar area, several people were in front of us and while we waited he asked me general, boring questions: how long it had taken me to get there? How my day had been?<br><br>I looked around the busy bar at people laughing, and having fun.<br><br>I wished I had the jovial energy for my own company. Then I scolded myself. I knew I wouldn’t see Frank again in a romantic way but perhaps we could have a nice couple of hours regardless.<br><br>He had made me laugh online, so maybe we would have some banter<br><br>And after all, Frank may not have found me attractive either.<br><br>Seconds later, however, I got a dramatic indication.<br><br>After ordering drinks, I turned to make small talk. Frank glared at me with serious, heavy, black eyes. He grinned and I noticed his teeth (or should I say lack of them) before he lunged at me, grabbing me and kissing me full-on, in front of an audience!<br><br>Eyes of thirsty customers surrounded us. Some clearly noticed the conflicting body language of Frank who was as keen and clumsy as a big dog, and me, whose posture became stiffer than the trunk of a tree.<br><br>Pulling away from the slobbery suction of Frank’s mouth, I felt my face burning. I glanced around and a few people were sniggering, other’s eyes wide, and one woman grimacing.<br><br>I was mortified, and shocked. It felt like a slug had crawled in my mouth. I’m not often speechless, but Frank rendered me mute.<br><br>The thought came into my head; had I encouraged such a bold move? Then I realised immediately, that I had absolutely not. We had only met in person less than five minutes before.</p>

    <p>There had been no messages in our prior conversation about me wanting to kiss him.<br><br>I hadn’t, ever, asked for it.<br><br>Frank had violated my boundaries and it wasn’t acceptable.<br><br>I squirmed out of his slimy embrace and looked at him wanting to say so much, but feeling shocked into silence.<br><br>He had the biggest smile on his face as if he had scored the winning penalty in the World Cup, as I stood, aghast, embarrassed, and revolted.<br><br>His own proud grin made me seethe. His first date etiquette was likely one of the reasons he was single.<br><br>‘Wow!’ he said, clapping his hands before reaching to hold my mine.<br><br>Wow indeed – but definitely not for the same reasons.<br><br>I quickly made my excuses to leave, saying (not without truth) that I felt sick.<br><br>I wanted to say so much… but I felt mute.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
