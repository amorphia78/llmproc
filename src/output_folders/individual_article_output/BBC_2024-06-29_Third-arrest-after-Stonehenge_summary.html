        <h1>Third arrest after Stonehenge sprayed with powder paint</h1><p>PRIMARY: Just Stop Oil campaigners sprayed orange powder paint on the historic Stonehenge site near Salisbury on June 19th. Three people have been arrested - a man in his 70s, a woman in her 20s, and a man in his 30s from Essex. The protesters demanded the next UK government end extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.</p>
