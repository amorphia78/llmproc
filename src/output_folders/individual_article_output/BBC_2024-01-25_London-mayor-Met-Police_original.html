    <p>Reform of the Met Police will slow unless the government &quot;steps in&quot; with more money, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says.<br><br>He is set to make the case directly to the home secretary at a meeting later.<br><br>Tory mayoral candidate Susan Hall said Mr Khan found extra money for striking Tube workers so he should &quot;go back down the back of the sofa&quot; to find more.<br><br>The Home Office says the Met receives the most funding per head compared with the rest of England and Wales.<br><br>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has warned that without an extra £140m it will take longer to address the racism, misogyny and homophobia identified by the Casey Review.<br><br>The mayor says the share City Hall contributes to London&#x27;s policing through council tax and business rates has grown from 18% to 25% in the eight years he has been mayor.<br><br>The remaining three-quarters of the Met&#x27;s £4.2bn budget comes from a Home Office grant.<br><br>Papers published ahead of Mr Khan&#x27;s appearance before the London Assembly later on Thursday show City Hall has proposed funding an extra £88m this year, and there is almost £120m extra coming from government.<br><br>However, the Met is still facing a &quot;black hole&quot; of £39m it says it needs to plug over the next few weeks with cuts and savings.<br><br>On top of that is the £140m Sir Mark says is necessary to see through the reform programme and put more officers on the front line.<br><br>Last year Baroness Casey concluded the capital &quot;no longer has a functioning neighbourhood policing service&quot; trusted by the public. The commissioner said a &quot;new beginning&quot; was needed.<br><br>&quot;The pace at which the commissioner is being asked to go, he will not be able to go at that pace without support from the government,&quot; said Mr Khan.</p>

    <p>&quot;Let&#x27;s see what the home secretary says. I hope he will be giving support to the Met Police Service, which they deserve.&quot;<br><br>Mr Khan told BBC London he would be asking for more money to reflect the Met&#x27;s unique national and international responsibilities, such as policing protests and protecting diplomats.<br><br>It has cost an extra £41m to handle a series of Just Stop Oil actions and protests related to the Middle East conflict, he said.<br><br>His Conservative opponent Ms Hall described his requests as &quot;amazing&quot;, particularly given the recent £30m found to avert a strike on the Underground.<br><br>&quot;He says he&#x27;s had no money for the last few years but he&#x27;s obviously been squirrelling it away so that he can spend it in an election year.<br><br>&quot;Let&#x27;s see if he can go back down the back of the sofa where he found all that money for his union mates and put more into the police.<br><br>&quot;They are the ones that need funding properly,&quot; she said.<br><br>A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;Decisions about how funding and resources are utilised in London is a matter for the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and the democratically elected mayor of London.<br><br>&quot;The Metropolitan Police receives the most funding per head of population compared with the rest of England and Wales, receiving up to £3.5bn in 2024-25, an increase of up to £119m on the previous year.<br><br>&quot;This includes £185m in recognition of the increased demands the force faces from policing the capital city.&quot;<br><br>Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.
