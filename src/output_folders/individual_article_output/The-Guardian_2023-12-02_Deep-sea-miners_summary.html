        <h1>Deep sea miners turn water hoses on Greenpeace activists in the Pacific</h1><p>PRIMARY: International Greenpeace activists from six countries have been using canoes and dinghies to obstruct the Coco, a deep sea mining exploration vessel operated by The Metals Company, in Pacific waters between Mexico and Hawaii. The protesters demand the company stop its mining exploration activities, with two activists boarding the ship and camping on equipment cranes until the company agrees to leave.<br><br>SECONDARY: The Metals Company sought a Dutch court injunction to keep protesters 500 meters away, but the court largely refused, allowing protests to continue while ordering climbers down from the ship.</p>
