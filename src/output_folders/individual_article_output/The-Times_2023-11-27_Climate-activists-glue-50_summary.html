        <h1>Climate activists glue 50 Barclays branches shut</h1><h2>Money Rebellion wants customers to boycott the bank because it invests in fossil fuel projects</h2><p>PRIMARY: Money Rebellion, a group linked to Extinction Rebellion, forced closure of 50 Barclays Bank branches by supergluing doors shut at locations in London, Glasgow, and Leeds. The activists demand Barclays stop funding fossil fuel projects and urged customers to boycott the bank, claiming it has invested $190.6 billion in fossil fuels since the Paris climate agreement.<br><br>SECONDARY: The action was described as part of a broader &quot;property-focused climate action&quot; wave targeting financial institutions funding fossil fuels.</p><p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: Barclays defended its approach, stating it aims to be net zero by 2050 and has reduced energy sector emissions by 32% since 2020 while providing Â£99 billion in green finance.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral tone, presenting both activist criticisms and Barclays&#x27; defensive response equally.</p></body></html>
