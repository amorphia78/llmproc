        <h1>Ten Just Stop Oil activists arrested at Heathrow</h1><p>PRIMARY: Ten Just Stop Oil activists were arrested at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of conspiring to interfere with key national infrastructure. Footage showed people cycling near a high barbed wire fence close to passenger planes before being approached by officers. The protesters demanded an end to burning fossil fuels, stating they &quot;refuse to die for fossil fuels&quot; as climate tipping points threaten society&#x27;s stability.<br><br>SECONDARY: Just Stop Oil claimed supporters of Last Generation caused delays at Cologne-Bonn Airport in Germany, with the airport confirming &quot;unauthorised people&quot; gained access to its security area.</p>
