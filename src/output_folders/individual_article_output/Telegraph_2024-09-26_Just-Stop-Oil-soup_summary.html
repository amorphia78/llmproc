    <p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil activists, Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland (both 22), threw soup on Van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers at London&#x27;s National Gallery in October 2022. The painting wasn&#x27;t damaged but the frame was. They were found guilty of criminal damage and face potential jail sentences at Friday&#x27;s sentencing.<br><br>SECONDARY: The article mentions Liberate Tate&#x27;s past performance interventions protesting BP sponsorship of Tate galleries starting in 2010, which successfully ended oil company sponsorship.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: Over 100 art experts, artists, and academics are campaigning to spare the activists from jail, arguing their act represents artistic iconoclasm similar to works by Banksy and other recognized artists.<br><br>TONE: The article presents a positive tone toward the protest, framing it through the lens of art experts who view it as legitimate artistic expression rather than criminal activity.</p></body></html>
