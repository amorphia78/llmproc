        <h1>I didn’t realise I’d been groomed and trafficked – then the panic attacks started</h1><p>When I was driven two hours from my hometown to Telford, aged just 16, to have sex with multiple men against my will, I wish I could say it was the first time.<br><br>Unfortunately, environments like this had become the norm to me.<br><br>In fact, I estimate that after being a victim of human trafficking, I was forced to have sex with at least 1,500 men over the course of five years.<br><br>On that day in Telford, myself and my friend Denise*, also 16, got out of the van and were led by her stepfather towards an abandoned flat.<br><br>Everywhere I looked, there were men having sex with women and girls.<br><br>Denise’s stepfather told us who to ‘start’ with. I complied and started having intercourse with several of the men.<br><br>I overheard discussions between the men talking about how much they were charging for our use. Later that afternoon, one even threatened me with a knife.<br><br>It felt like just another day in the life of a victim of modern slavery, but now – after fully coming to terms with what happened to me and having a family – I’ve made it my mission to raise awareness and campaign so that what happened to me will never happen to my daughter, or anyone else.<br><br>I had a normal upbringing in Wales – my parents were together and both worked good jobs.<br><br>But when I started high school, life took a turn. The transition from primary school was hard and I struggled with the workload and making friends.<br><br>I rarely went and when I did, I left early. Instead, I hung around my estate – and that made me vulnerable.<br><br>My best friend at the time, Katie*, lived nearby and it didn’t take long for her stepdad to pick up that I was easy to take advantage of – that’s where the trafficking began.<br><br>He told me, a girl of only 11, that if I delivered drugs for him, he would buy me cigarettes.<br><br>I was 14 years old, and my ordeal was only just beginning<br><br>I didn’t think anything of it – it was an easy job taking drugs down my top from one end of the estate to the other, getting fags as payment.<br><br>Not long after, I was expelled from school for my behaviour and persistent absence, moving to a specialist college where I met my friend Andrea* and things got worse.<br><br>Andrea and I spent more time together, and one day she took me to a park behind a kebab shop we visited.<br><br>Some men she knew from the shop met us there. Andrea signalled for me to get in their car, and when I did, they took me away and raped me, catching me quickly when I tried to escape.<br><br>I felt like I had been ripped apart. I was hurting all over and it felt like my body wasn’t my own. It was a disconnect – almost like adrenaline, until the pain trickled in and then got worse.<br><br>I was 14 years old, and my ordeal was only just beginning.<br><br>When I shared details of this traumatic event to Andrea, she dismissed me, saying it was ‘just sex’. I was in so much agony afterwards. When we walked home to her house, I dumped my bloodied clothes on the way.<br><br>I later found out my friend had been groomed and exploited, and she was doing the same to me.<br><br>Traumatised, I used alcohol and drugs (primarily weed and speed) to dull what had happened, but things only got worse.<br><br>It seemed like a group of men knew what had happened to me and made me do sexual favours for them all the time in return for something I needed or wanted.<br><br>Soon, it was a regular thing. If I needed a taxi, drugs, a drink at the pub, or even a kebab, I had to do some kind of sexual favour – I was simply a target, ripe for exploitation.<br><br>My parents just believed me when I told them I was hanging out with friends. In fact, they were really glad I was being social after not being able to easily make friends.<br><br>At 16, I was strangled by a drug dealer when I was trying to protect a friend<br><br>That’s when things escalated with Denise’s stepfather, who owned a fast food shop that was 15 miles from the centre of town. He would hang out with many men in the same line of work as him.<br><br>Eventually, we had been used for sex by many of them – they all knew who we were and that they could use us if they wanted.<br><br>Denise’s stepfather knew men all over the country who would pay to have sex with girls – girls like Denise and I. That’s when he came up with the idea to take us to Telford ‘for a cruise’ – except it was just his mate’s flat in Telford.<br><br>Before long, my friend and I were routinely taken around the country to have sex with men.<br><br>During this time, I was attacked a couple of times. At 16, I was strangled by a drug dealer when I was trying to protect a friend.<br><br>I had red marks on my neck and Mum took me to the police station to report it. As far as I know, nothing ever came of it.<br><br>Another time, someone threatened to petrol bomb my house. I don’t know why they did it – it was like they just enjoyed inflicting fear and pain. I reported this to the police too and the boy was arrested then made to pay a small fine.<br><br>During all my years of exploitation, I was known to the police. I would later find out there were 200 pages detailing how I had been arrested, made reports, been referred to social services, and had others ringing the police concerned about my welfare.</p>

    <p>I can’t remember most of it, even though it clearly happened. There was never any significant police intervention though.<br><br>Throughout this whole time, I have since estimated (via later writing a book, while working through notes I had made, police reports, and memories) I was raped by over 1,500 men. And I say rape because I couldn’t properly consent.<br><br>I started to lose a lot of weight because my mouth and throat were too sore from the abuse to eat. I choked so much when I tried to swallow.<br><br>Soon, I was self-harming.<br><br>At 20, I found out I was pregnant, but the father wasn’t someone who had abused me – he seemed different from the others. This relationship was short-lived though.<br><br>Initially, I was terrified. I said to my parents I was going to have an abortion, but they assured me they would help bring a baby up with me.<br><br>When my daughter was born, my life was turned upside down again. But this time, for the better.<br><br>I knew my only responsibility was to reform my life for my daughter’s sake – I had to care for her and keep her safe. But it was incredibly hard. I stopped taking drugs, and I cut myself off from everyone who I had spent nearly a decade with, including my friends. It was a very lonely time.<br><br>But I got older and stronger, and was committed to starting a new life for my daughter. My trafficking ended, just like that.<br><br>For years after my little girl was born, I suppressed everything I had been through.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
