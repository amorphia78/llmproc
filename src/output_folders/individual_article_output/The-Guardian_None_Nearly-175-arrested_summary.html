    <p>PRIMARY: Climate activists, including several hundred Extinction Rebellion members, targeted the Paris headquarters of Amundi (a major TotalEnergies shareholder) during its annual meeting. A few dozen protesters forced their way into Amundi&#x27;s tower block, daubing graffiti on walls and smashing windows, injuring eight security staff. Police detained 173 people. The activists demand action against TotalEnergies&#x27; oil and gas activities, which they say contribute to global warming and biodiversity destruction.</p>
