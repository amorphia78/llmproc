    <p>Placing the plate of cut up toast and peanut butter in front of my toddler, I catch a glimpse of my phone from the corner of my eye.<br><br>It briefly lights up before going dark again. But, given that it’s 6am, I can’t imagine it’s anything urgent.<br><br>Still, I reach for my mobile, curious, and then 256 WhatsApp notifications appear before me.<br><br>With bleary eyes, and a surge of anxiety, I delete the notifications – after realising none are, indeed, urgent – and place my phone, face down, on the counter where it will now stay for a few hours.<br><br>I wish I could say this is the first time I’ve woken to a tidal wave of texts, but it’s not. In fact, a recent count put me as a member of 189 (!) WhatsApp groups.<br><br>Admittedly over 100 of these have lain dormant for a while and I simply have been too lazy to go to the bother of exiting and then deleting them. However, that doesn’t stop the messages from coming.<br><br>My partner and I both have parents who are separated, which doubles the family groups we have. And then there are groups with different line-ups of friends; my own ones, my partner’s, or a blend of both.<br><br>And since becoming a mother, the overwhelm of my inbox has become even more intense.<br><br>Now I share groups with local mums and parents, nursery parents and, if you can believe it, other attendees of a children’s birthday party my son and I will be going to later in the year.<br><br>It’s too much, which is exactly why I am trying to make my phone a less interesting place. Or rather a place that demands less of my attention.<br><br>So far, this has included putting my phone ‘to bed’ at 7pm in the kitchen when my son goes to sleep and buying a cheap digital clock for our room, as I found the notifications on my screen became too much of a draw if I woke in the night, as parents of little ones so often do.<br><br>It’s only been a month or two, but this has made a huge impact on any sense of connection I felt to my little handheld device.<br><br>Before it was with me almost all of the time, never switched off and perched on the nightstand next to me as I slept. I openly admit that I have struggled with phone addiction in the past.<br><br>I have also spent a lot of time deleting the apps that I would normally trawl through in a zombie-like state of partial awareness — like Instagram and X.<br><br>Deleting these has massively helped, but there is one app that I have to completely overhaul my relationship with: WhatsApp.<br><br>The tyranny of WhatsApp groups has started to tip me over the edge. Far too often they are places in which two notifications can quickly turn into 250 – as evidenced by that bleary eyed breakfast.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times. Then, one day, he opened his front door and started walking. He didn&#x27;t stop for three years, by which time he&#x27;d walked the coast of the UK and improved his mental health.<br><br>Writer Azania Patel shares her worst date series for our So, How Did it Go? series. She fancied her date - until he admitted to being a Just Stop Oil protester.<br><br>Labour MP Dawn Butler shines a light on the small change the Conservatives have made recently that could help them steal the election. She reckons you didn&#x27;t even notice.</p>

    <p>And finally, mum-of-two Kellie Whitehead recalls the time she took &#x27;snus&#x27; with her 17-year-old son. She says she was overwhelmed by the strength of the nicotine pouch and now has a warning for parents.<br><br>And I don’t know about you, but there is something that feels quite urgent to me about this app rather than other ones. As an instant messenger, every message seems to be begging for a response so I find it hard to leave them unread.<br><br>Perhaps that’s because it is my primary source of communication with almost everyone in my life – particularly with my closest circle – which makes it too necessary to simply delete.<br><br>Admittedly, until recently, I was the person creating these groups. But whether it’s because there is even more pressure on my time than there was before I became a mum, or simply the guilt that is attached to spending time scrolling through messages when I’m with him, this past year has really helped me to re-evaluate my relationship with my phone and its role in my life.<br><br>I have started to see the error in my ways and the fact I have been clogging up other people’s inboxes, which is why I have made a resolution to leave as many WhatsApp groups as I can without completely cutting me and my family off from our community.<br><br>That means saying goodbye to any groups to which I no longer feel the need to be part of.<br><br>Farewell to those dormant chats I really should have deleted long ago<br><br>Like the one named ‘Mexico’ to set up a holiday that never quite left the ground, or one simply named ‘stretch tents’ as part of our wedding organisation. And then there are multiple stag and hen do groups that happened half a decade ago and for some reason still live on in my inbox.<br><br>And I’ve already started quietly sliding out of some of the groups I feel I’ve drifted from or friends I haven’t spoken to for a while.<br><br>I don’t intend to make a big show of my exits (although, announcing that I’m doing this on a national news site is hardly a conspicuous approach), but over the next few weeks, I’m having an early spring clean of my inbox. It’s time.<br><br>Ideally, I’d love to become one of those people who loftily replies to messages a few days later. If I could, I’d delete the whole thing and go analogue, but I can’t quite bring myself to cut myself off completely.<br><br>For these precious years of my children’s lives in particular, I want to spend as much of it being as present as I can.<br><br>Here’s hoping that removing these groups will make my phone a less busy place and one that draws my attention away less.<br><br>Whatever happens, I know reducing the amount of areas in which my attention can be split can only be a good thing.<br><br>Do you have a story you’d like to share?
