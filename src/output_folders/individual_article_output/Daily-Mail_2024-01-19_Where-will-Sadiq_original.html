    <p>Mayor Sadiq Khan was today accused of &#x27;fake, magic money tree promises&#x27; after he revealed Transport for London (TfL) fares will be frozen until March next year.<br><br>Underground and bus fares were expected to rise in line with National Rail prices which the Government is hiking by 4.9 per cent in six weeks&#x27; time from March 3.<br><br>But Mr Khan, who chairs TfL, revealed the freeze in a surprise announcement, saying it will be paid for by allocating £123million of Greater London Authority funding.<br><br>The Labour mayor said he &#x27;wasn&#x27;t prepared to stand by&#x27; while passengers pay more for public transport in other parts of Britain - but Susan Hall, his Conservative opponent in May&#x27;s mayoral election, described the policy as a &#x27;last roll of the dice&#x27;.<br><br>The freeze will apply to pay-as-you-go fares for bus, Tube, DLR and tram journeys, and most of those fares for Overground and Elizabeth line trips. Bus fares will remain at £1.75, while an adult peak Tube single in zones one to three will still be £3.80.<br><br>However, some passengers will still pay more - with the cost of a Travelcard set to rise between 4.6 per cent and 5.1 per cent; and the daily and weekly &#x27;cap&#x27; amounts for multiple pay-as-you-go journeys going up between 4.1 per cent and 5.1 per cent.<br><br>This means a Travelcard for zones one to six will rise from £21.50 to £22.60 for peak travel. The daily cap for zones one to two will rise from £8.10 to £8.50; from £9.60 to £10 for zones one to three; and from £14.90 to £15.60 for zones one to six.<br><br>But City Hall said an example of the benefits of the overall fares freeze include someone commuting from Hornchurch to a central London station five days a week avoiding a potential 20p increase to their fare, saving up to £90 a year.<br><br>By contrast, the Government set a cap of 4.9 per cent for rises in regulated fares on mainline train services in England from March 3.<br><br>City Hall calculated that TfL fares will be 14 per cent lower this year than if they had risen in line with England&#x27;s rail fares since 2016.<br><br>But Ms Hall said: &#x27;This fares freeze is Sadiq Khan&#x27;s last roll of the dice, because he knows that his eight years of failure will catch up with him this May.<br><br>&#x27;After pleading poverty throughout his mayoralty, Sadiq Khan expects us to believe that he has miraculously conjured up this money, when the truth is we will be paying for it through increased council tax, his unfair Ulez expansion and a new tax that will charge you for every mile you drive.&#x27;<br><br>Responding to the claim about the new road tax, a spokesperson for Mr Khan said: &#x27;Pay per mile charging has been ruled out by the mayor and no such scheme is on the table.&#x27;<br><br>Conservative politicians previously criticised Mr Khan for freezing fares for the first four years after he was elected in May 2016.<br><br>They claimed this damaged TfL&#x27;s finances and contributed to the transport body being reliant on Government bailouts following the start of the coronavirus pandemic.<br><br>Mr Khan has insisted the need for funding was caused by the collapse in revenue from the drop in passenger numbers due to the virus crisis.<br><br>Neil Garratt, leader of the City Hall Conservatives, said today: &#x27;Let&#x27;s be clear, Sadiq Khan is temporarily freezing TfL fares to try to buy the votes of Londoners.<br><br>&#x27;As chairman of TfL, Sadiq Khan has run cap in hand to the Government at every opportunity crying poor and demanding money to keep London&#x27;s buses, trains and Tube moving.<br><br>&#x27;Facing an election in May, the Mayor has miraculously found £123million from his magic money train to freeze fares for one year. Londoners are no fools. They will see this fare freeze as a desperate bid by a failing mayor to win their vote.&#x27;<br><br>But Mr Khan said: &#x27;While people across the country face another hike in their rail fares, I simply wasn&#x27;t prepared to stand by and see TfL customers face a similar hike.<br><br>&#x27;This is the fifth fares freeze I&#x27;ve done since becoming mayor, making transport in our city 21 per cent cheaper than it would have been had fares risen by inflation.<br><br>&#x27;This shows that whenever I can freeze fares, I do so.</p>

    <p>&#x27;As we continue building a fairer, greener and more prosperous London for everyone, making public transport more affordable and appealing will continue to be a key part of my plan.&#x27;<br><br>The fares freeze will not include paper Travelcards, which can also be used for mainline rail journeys in the capital.<br><br>Some 80 per cent of Tube journeys and 74 per cent of bus journeys are made on a pay-as-you-go basis, City Hall said.<br><br>Mr Khan also announced that fines for fare dodgers will rise from £80 to £100 - reduced to £50 if paid within 21 days - from March 3.<br><br>In January last year, the Department for Transport increased the penalty fare on rail services to £100.<br><br>Paul Tuohy, chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, said: &#x27;This is good news for the millions of Londoners and visitors who use TfL services to travel across the city.<br><br>&#x27;Affordable public transport will not only help people with the cost of living, but it will also help with the fight against climate change, after the planet&#x27;s warmest year on record.&#x27;<br><br>And Michael Roberts, chief executive of  London TravelWatch, said: &#x27;London&#x27;s public transport services are among some of the most expensive in the world, so the fares freeze will bring some welcome relief to hard-pressed passengers.<br><br>&#x27;We hope there will be continued focus on making public transport in the capital more affordable over time, especially for lower-income Londoners.&#x27;<br><br>Despite the freeze, London is still said to have some of the most expensive public transport fares in Europe.<br><br>A Greenpeace report last year ranked the city the second-worst for public transport affordability among 30 European capitals, just behind Dublin.<br><br>Earlier this month a planned walkout on the London Underground by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union was called off minutes before it was due to begin.<br><br>However, Mayor Sadiq Khan was accused of opening the door to more Tube strikes after he found £30million to stop the walkouts.<br><br>Mr Khan&#x27;s announcement today comes after  London North Eastern Railway (LNER) caused major fury this week by unveiling controversial plans to scrap all Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets on trains between London and Edinburgh.<br><br>Rail passengers were left in tears, MPs slammed the idea as a &#x27;disaster&#x27; and experts said it could see people lose hundreds of pounds if their plans unexpectedly change.<br><br>LNER insisted the fares on one of Britain&#x27;s busiest rail lines were being simplified and based on demand in an attempt to encourage more people to travel by train.<br><br>But those examining the detail condemned the Uber-style surge pricing plans which include a new &#x27;Semi Flexible&#x27; fare that will be more expensive when trains are busier.<br><br>And travellers now fear this two-year trial overhauling fares on the East Coast Main Line will reduce choice and flexibility, especially for those making last-minute trips.<br><br>It means passengers may now have to buy the priciest Anytime fare for immediate or flexible travel. That currently costs £193.90 from London to Edinburgh, rather than £87 for a Super-Off Peak ticket which is refundable and not tied to a specific train.<br><br>Also this week, the union Aslef said train drivers on LNER will strike for five days next month as the long running pay dispute continues.<br><br>Employees will walk out from Monday, February 5 until Friday, February 9 on the network which runs between London King&#x27;s Cross and Scotland via Newcastle.<br><br>The drivers on the East Coast Main Line route will also refuse to work any non-contractual overtime from Wednesday, February 7 until Saturday, February 10.<br><br>Yesterday&#x27;s announcement on the LNER action came on top of a wider set of fresh strikes and an overtime ban announced by the union on January 15, which will impact 17 different rail operators across nine days between Monday, January 29 and Tuesday, February 6.<br><br>LNER is already going to be impacted by that previously-announced strike on Friday, February 2 - with other firms affected on other days, causing maximum disruption.</p>
