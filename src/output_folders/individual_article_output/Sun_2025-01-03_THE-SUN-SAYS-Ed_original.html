Some are justified.<br><br>But in 16 days Trump, with Musk at his side, will be reinstalled as leader of the free world. America is our No1 ally. We are meant to have a “special relationship”.<br><br>We are meant to be teeing up the lucrative trade deal spoken of for so long.<br><br>All of it seems in grave jeopardy if the White House is campaigning to unseat a Government with four years left to run.<br><br>It doesn’t help for pipsqueak Labour ministers like Andrew Gwynne to retaliate by telling the world’s richest man — with 210million Twitter followers — to butt out of UK politics.<br><br>Sir Keir needs to repair this rift fast.</p>
