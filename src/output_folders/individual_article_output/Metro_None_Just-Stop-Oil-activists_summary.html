    <p>PRIMARY: Four Just Stop Oil activists stormed the stage during a West End performance of Les Miserables, unfurling their flag and chaining themselves to the stage with bicycle locks. The protesters included 23-year-old community worker Hannah Taylor and 19-year-old student Poppy Bliss. They demanded an end to new oil and gas projects, specifically opposing the government&#x27;s approval of the Rosebank oil project. The disruption halted the performance for 20 minutes.</p>
