    <p>An environmentalist embarking on a clean-up tour of the UK has said climate action is about individual responsibility rather than &quot;just screaming&quot; for government action.<br><br>Vivek Gurav, 29, from Wembley, north-west London, has started a &quot;plogging&quot; tour of 50 UK cities, where he litter picks while jogging.<br><br>He started plogging in India, and has also completed a previous mission in the UK.<br><br>Mr Gurav said he supported disruptive movements like Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, but he wanted to tackle the climate crisis with more practical action.<br><br>Mr Gurav, who moved to the UK to study an MSc in environmental policy and management, said he wanted &quot;more people to be on ground and do something about this problem&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Instead of just screaming, if they go and pick up rubbish or do some form of biodiversity conservation, it&#x27;s going to bring them closer to the green spaces.</p>

    <p>&quot;[Disruptive protest] also brings a sense of refusing responsibility towards the environment and just blaming everything on the government, which I don&#x27;t think is the only approach,&quot; he said.<br><br>Mr Gurav is encouraging university groups, NGOs and local communities to join him.<br><br>&quot;The plogging movement that has been building up, it&#x27;s to bring such individuals together who are ready to go out there and do something from their own actions.<br><br>&quot;Simpler actions also create a bigger ripple effect.&quot;<br><br>Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.
