The protesters held signs featuring photos of the sentenced activists, calling them &quot;climate prisoners&quot; and accusing British authorities of &quot;endangering democracy.&quot;<br><br>SECONDARY: Similar protests occurred at British missions in Amsterdam, Paris and Rome. Last Generation has previously disrupted roads and airports by gluing themselves to surfaces, switched off oil pipelines, and spray-painted Brandenburg Gate orange.</p>
