        <h1>How Glastonbury lost the plot</h1><h2>Once a countercultural haven, the festival’s recent controversies reveal just how fraught the balance between music and message has become</h2><p>Glastonbury has always been a political music festival. It started in 1970 as part of the hippie movement, has been associated with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) for more than 40 years, and is always haunted by Left-wing speakers who are guaranteed a rapturous welcome.<br><br>Causes championed at Worthy Farm over the years include saving the environment, world peace and lifting children out of poverty around the globe. This year, however, one issue overshadowed all others: the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.<br><br>The build-up to this year’s festival was dominated by questions about whether Kneecap, the Irish rappers, would remain on the bill or have their set broadcast by the BBC after one of their members was charged with a terror offence; it is alleged that Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh displayed a Hezbollah flag at a concert last November. He denies the charges.<br><br>Kneecap gigs were cancelled across the country, but in this febrile atmosphere, Glastonbury bosses stood firm. “There have been a lot of really heated topics this year, but we remain a platform for many, many artists from all over the world,” organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC last week. “Everyone is welcome here.”<br><br>Eavis, 45, may now regret that sentiment as the dust continues to settle on the most controversial Glastonbury yet. Kneecap – who led chants of “F--- Keir Starmer” and “Free Palestine” – were made to look relatively moderate by the punk duo Bob Vylan, who railed against the Israel Defence Forces in the preceding gig on the West Holts stage. They led thousands of fans in chants of “Death, death to the IDF,” which have been condemned by ministers and Jewish groups alike, investigated by the police, and sparked turmoil at the BBC – even leading to calls for the director general to resign.<br><br>How is it that performers at a festival set up in the wake of the Summer of Love are now the subjects of police probes into hate speech?<br><br>This year seems to be the one where Glastonbury lost the plot, as such angry, violent language on stage feels out of step with its counter-cultural origins. Ahead of the 1971 edition, just the second festival hosted at Worthy Farm, artists such as David Bowie and Hawkwind put their names to a manifesto calling for conservation and more spirituality.<br><br>“Man is fast ruining his environment,” it read. “He is suffering from the effects of pollution; from the neurosis brought about by a basically urban industrial society; from a lack of spirituality in his life; and from a spiritual awakening.” The organisers said that Glastonbury was for the “expression of free-thinking people.”<br><br>One might wonder how much “free thinking” happens at Glastonbury now, as it takes a brave sort to go against the prevailing wisdom of the liberal Left. This year, for instance, Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform UK, was invited to the festival for a debate against Zack Polanski, his Green Party counterpart. Tice declined because “my team concluded that it would not be safe.”<br><br>While supporters of Palestine were loud and proud over the weekend, those with ties to or support for Israel may have been better advised to keep their heads down.<br><br>There were only three editions between 1970 and 1979 because the festival lost money. It was relaunched in 1981 as the Glastonbury CND festival. Michael Eavis, Emily’s father and the festival’s founder, is a strong opponent of nuclear weapons and ran the event in partnership with the activist organisation. Alongside music, Glastonbury hosted speakers who addressed the crowds, including the Marxist historian EP Thompson, future Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown and Bruce Kent, the CND chairman. Looking back, it all seems very genteel, and the festival raised £1 million for the CND during the 1980s.<br><br>Following the end of the Cold War, Eavis believed people would become more concerned about environmentalism than nuclear Armageddon, so he forged partnerships with charities like Greenpeace and Oxfam. This tradition has continued to the present day, and in 2022, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg appeared on the Pyramid Stage to warn that the world faces a “total natural catastrophe” because of global warming.<br><br>The combination of pop and politics is one of the attractions for many Glastonbury-goers, according to Liam Bailey, a photojournalist who was there this year and has been visiting for more than three decades. “You do hear and see quite a lot of political action on the stages and around the edges,” says Bailey, who published the book Glastonbury: The Festival and Its People last year. “It’s speaking to an audience that is there either for entertainment, for a bit of messaging, or for a bit of both.”<br><br>“There was radicalism in the Eighties and there were lots of thoughts about New Labour in the Nineties. From the perspective of the festival, there was a [feeling of] bereavement and loss with the long reign of the Conservatives [until 2024].”<br><br>The idea that Glastonbury was not just a place to be entertained by favourite music acts but also a crucible for progressive philosophy and debate was confirmed in 2000, when Left-wing singer Billy Bragg started organising the Left Field tent. Its programme combines political discussion and protest music, with “recharge your activism” as its mantra. One of the most frequent speakers over the years was Labour MP Tony Benn, after whom the tower by the Left Field tent was named following his death in 2014.<br><br>Benn was an intellectual heavyweight who earned respect even from opponents with very different views. The members of Kneecap and Bob Vylan are not exactly following in his footsteps; some might say they are merely seeking attention. “What we have got at the moment is amplification of anything that is done. I didn’t see anybody stand up there and give a really good, strong critical understanding of the situation and then talk to an audience about it,” Bailey says.</p><p>“It’s all a throwaway line or quick flashpoint of grabbing a flag, or something. I’ve got no understanding why those particular artists do that in that way because it doesn’t really enhance any of the conversations,” he adds. “It doesn’t bring forward any debate other than, ‘I’m holding a flag, so does that get me some more coverage?’”<br><br>Boris Johnson offers a useful example of how much Glastonbury has changed in recent years. In 2000, Bragg invited Johnson – then editor of The Spectator – to tour the festival site with him and speak from one of the fringe stages. The BBC broadcast footage of the future prime minister reciting Homer in the original Greek, an effort that earned him a rousing round of applause.<br><br>Such a spectacle would be unthinkable now, in what are much more febrile and censorious times. In his 2019 headline set, Stormzy wore a Banksy-designed stab-proof vest with a Union Flag on its front and the crowd gleefully sang one of the lines in Vossi Bop: “F--- the government and f--- Boris.”<br><br>The party-political mission creep arguably began in 2017, when then-Labour leader (and long-time friend of Benn) Jeremy Corbyn spoke to a packed audience in front of the Pyramid stage. He was serenaded by tens of thousands singing his name to the tune of “Seven Nation Army” by The White Stripes as he urged people to “build bridges, not walls.” Michael Eavis described him on stage as a “hero.”<br><br>Today, dissenting from the prevailing ethos among festival-goers is enough to cause performers grief. Take Rod Stewart, who played the Sunday teatime slot reserved for musical legends. Though he has impeccable credentials when it comes to speaking out against Israeli actions in Gaza (at least to the Palestine flag-wavers in attendance), the fact that he gave an interview the day before saying, “We’ve got to give [Nigel] Farage a chance,” made him a bogeyman for others on the bill.<br><br>Kneecap fans booed Stewart’s name when it was mentioned during the rap trio’s set (one member of the band also quipped that “he’s older than Israel”), while the south London singer-songwriter Joy Crookes urged those at her gig to “Boycott Rod Stewart”.<br><br>Some will commend Eavis for having the strength to stand by Kneecap when other gig organisers cancelled their shows – but it is also notable that, despite all the talk of Glastonbury “welcoming everyone,” high-profile artists with links to Israel who might have been given a platform after their own concerts were cancelled were absent.<br><br>For instance, Radiohead lead guitarist Jonny Greenwood (who has headlined the Pyramid Stage before) was due to play gigs in London and Bristol last week with the Israeli musician Dudu Tassa; the shows were cancelled after threats were made to the venues by anti-Israeli activists. Glastonbury could surely have found the duo a spot on one of their stages.<br><br>Have Glastonbury bosses lost control? The Bob Vylan fiasco so clearly discomfited festival organisers that Emily Eavis made the unusual move of joining the chorus of disapproval over what happened on stage. “We will always believe in – and actively campaign for – hope, unity, peace and love,” she wrote on Instagram.<br><br>“With almost 4,000 performances at Glastonbury 2025, there will inevitably be artists and speakers appearing on our stages whose views we do not share, and a performer’s presence here should never be seen as a tacit endorsement of their opinions and beliefs. However, we are appalled by the statements made from the West Holts stage by Bob Vylan.”<br><br>She added: “Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the Festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.”<br><br>Part of the difficulty for Glastonbury is that it is no longer an insurgent, counter-cultural force. Instead, it has become the country’s pre-eminent music event and is so much a part of the Establishment that some guests are helicoptered in and spend tens of thousands of pounds on glamping sites. It is so mainstream now that even Samantha Cameron, wife of former Tory prime minister David, was spotted in the backstage areas this year.<br><br>Another aggravating factor is the blanket live coverage that the BBC now provides, with acts from the five largest stages broadcast to the world. If any performers had behaved like Bob Vylan in previous decades, it would have made little to no impact on public consciousness because there was no quick way to spread the word about what happened on the festival’s third-largest stage.<br><br>Then there is social media. The BBC decided, ahead of Kneecap’s set, not to broadcast it live in case what happened on stage fell foul of its editorial guidelines, denying the band the oxygen of publicity. But that was undone when a festival-goer, Helen Wilson, streamed the set live from the front of the stage on her TikTok account, drawing more than 2 million viewers.<br><br>Michael Eavis was asked by the Glastonbury Free Press, the festival’s newspaper, whether the event still stood for something before it kicked off last week. His answer was telling. “Oh heaven’s above, yes, of course it does,” he replied. “And I think the people that come here are into all those things. People that don’t agree with the politics of the event can go somewhere else.”</p></body></html>
