    <p>Greta Thunberg and four co-defendants have been found not guilty of breaking the law when they refused to follow police instructions to move on during a climate protest.<br><br>District Judge John Law threw out a public order charge due to &quot;no evidence&quot; of any offence being committed adding police attempted to impose &quot;unlawful&quot; conditions.<br><br>The 21-year-old was arrested at a climate change demonstration near the InterContinental Hotel in Mayfair on 17 October.<br><br>The judge said that the conditions imposed on protesters were &quot;so unclear that it is unlawful&quot;.<br><br>He added that it meant that &quot;anyone failing to comply were actually committing no offence&quot;.<br><br>&quot;It is quite striking to me that there were no witness statements taken from anyone in the hotel, approximately 1,000 people, or from anyone trying to get in,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;There was no evidence of any vehicles being impeded, no evidence of any interference with emergency services, or any risk to life.&quot;<br><br>He said that the protest was &quot;throughout peaceful, civilised and non-violent&quot; and criticised evidence provided by the prosecution about the location of where the demonstrators should be moved to, saying the only helpful footage he received was &quot;made by an abseiling protester&quot;.<br><br>The court heard that protesters started to gather near the hotel in October last year at around 07:30 and police engaged with them about improving access for members of the public, which the prosecution alleged had been made &quot;impossible&quot;.<br><br>The judge rejected the submission as &quot;the main entrance was accessible (meaning) that the condition... was unnecessary when the defendants were arrested&quot;.<br><br>By Sean Dilley at Westminster Magistrates Court<br><br>The judge was scathing about the police&#x27;s decision to impose unlawful restrictions on Greta Thunberg and other climate protesters.</p>
