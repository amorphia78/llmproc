    <p>A mural depicting the Gavin and Stacey character Nessa asking the prime minister &quot;what&#x27;s occurring?&quot; appeared overnight on a beach in Port Talbot.<br><br>The 50m (164ft) artwork was created by the campaign groups Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion, who said the aim was to &quot;send [Sir Keir] Starmer a message about the future of UK steel&quot;.<br><br>The second of Tata Steel&#x27;s two blast furnaces at its Port Talbot site will close at the end of the month, with about 2,000 jobs set to be lost.<br><br>The UK government reached a “new and improved deal” with Tata Steel, offering a £500m subsidy towards a £1.25bn electric arc furnace at the site.<br><br>The planned electric arc furnace will melt scrap steel or iron to produce steel.<br><br>However, it will no longer be able to produce new, or virgin, steel.<br><br>Greenpeace UK campaigner Paul Morozzo said he was urging the prime minister &quot;to keep steelmaking at home, rather than rely on imported steel&quot;.</p>

    <p>“Proper investment in UK green steel production would help our renewable energy supply chain whilst supporting workers and communities in places like Port Talbot and Scunthorpe,&quot; Mr Morozzo said.<br><br>Tata has agreed to look at future investment opportunities in Wales, which are thought to include the potential for wind turbines to be made in South Wales at a new plate mill.<br><br>A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said the UK government was &quot;working in partnership with trade unions and business to secure a green steel transition that’s both right for the workforce and delivers economic growth&quot;.<br><br>“We will publish a steel strategy next spring that will set out a long-term vision for a bright and sustainable steel sector and will work in lockstep with our industrial strategy – which will ramp up investment and create more well-paid jobs right across the supply chain,&quot; they added.</p>
