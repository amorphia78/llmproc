    <p>PRIMARY: Dr Sarah Benn, a 57-year-old GP from Birmingham, participated in peaceful demonstrations at Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire in 2022, holding a &quot;no new oil&quot; sign. She breached a civil injunction, was imprisoned for 31 days, and now faces a Medical Practitioners Tribunal that could remove her from the medical register. Her demand was for the government to end new fossil fuel projects.<br><br>SECONDARY: Just Stop Oil noted that three GPs are under scrutiny for similar protest activities this year, with Dr Benn&#x27;s case being the first heard.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article focuses on the intersection of medical ethics and climate activism, with Dr Benn arguing her protests align with medical duties to protect public health from climate crisis threats.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral, factual tone while giving substantial space to Dr Benn&#x27;s justifications for her actions.</p></body></html>
