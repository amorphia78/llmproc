    <p>‘You have OCD.’<br><br>When I heard those words, I didn’t feel angry or sad. In all honesty, I felt bored and tired by it.<br><br>After 30 years of poor mental health, I wasn’t thrilled to be adding another condition to my list.<br><br>As well as OCD, I have generalised anxiety disorder, panic attacks, depressive periods and I used to self-harm.<br><br>Admittedly, that doesn’t look great on paper, but thanks to something called ‘radical acceptance’, I can now function and do the things I want to do.<br><br>I showed signs of OCD and anxious behaviour from an early age. I wouldn’t eat anything that I had touched for fear of contamination and if any part of my hand did make contact, then I would leave that bit on my plate.<br><br>I checked use-by dates obsessively. I constantly feared that the food I was eating was ‘off’ so I would throw it away or refuse to eat it.<br><br>There’s no big or exciting story about why I’m mentally ill either. I have therapy and there’s been no moment of revelation, no deep buried secret that explains my behaviour.<br><br>Just thousands of tiny moments of emotional damage that left lasting scars on my mind, coupled with the mundane reality of not having the support that I needed during my formative years.<br><br>I’m not alone. Mental health charity, Mind, estimate at least one in four people in England experience a mental health problem each year.<br><br>As an adult, I take full responsibility for my mental health but I have found the whole obsession with ‘getting over’ poor mental health frustrating.<br><br>I constantly struggle with the ever-present pressure to ‘get better’, and the reality for me is that, at 37, it’s unlikely that I will ever be a mentally well person (whatever that means).<br><br>At best, I’m a highly functioning depressive and, at my worst, I’m paralysed by my inner fears, repetitive thoughts and obsessions.<br><br>These take many forms as an adult. I once had an intrusive fear that I would lose an arm that lasted for six months. I had a knife phobia for around six years.<br><br>Eventually, I hit breaking point. I was commuting four hours a day for a stressful news job in 2015 and I really feared I would lose my mind. I spent my weekends in bed and experienced anxiety attacks during the night.<br><br>I wanted to find a way to be well in a world that feels increasingly unstable, especially in a country that doesn’t prioritise mental health care.<br><br>I was aware of the concept of radical honesty from working in the media industry and I felt like it could be a great idea for mental health. I wasn’t surprised to find that radical acceptance already existed so I thought I would try it.<br><br>This is a practice that means letting go of judgements, wishing things were different and the need to control things that you cannot do anything about.<br><br>This last part particularly resonated with me, as I want to control everything to make sure nothing bad happens – which, of course, is impossible.<br><br>It may sound very woo-woo and I can understand why people wouldn’t like the concept because we live in a world where we’re told if we believe and work hard enough, our circumstances will change.<br><br>Yet, letting go of this idea of being mentally well has helped me irrevocably.<br><br>I used to analyse each day for the places it went wrong, in the hope that the next day would be different. Instead of this obsessive perfectionism, I just let it go.<br><br>My problem is that I think about things over and over again, so I try to move my thoughts along to anything else, whether it’s a bird I can see out of the window or trying to remember celebrities who dated each other.<br><br>It takes practice to stop obsessing over the things that go wrong but perfection is a lie; something I remind myself of when I feel bad about not being better or achieving more.<br><br>If I have an anxiety attack, I just accept it by not judging or scolding myself and I try to be neutral instead of making it about my emotional failings. This is a better alternative than letting it derail my entire week with self-blame and disappointment.<br><br>Years ago, I bought into this idea that I could jump out of bed every morning and live life with a ‘clean mind’, like something out of an advert.<br><br>I was forever hoping that negative emotions wouldn’t be a part of my life. As a child, I was always told ‘just be happy,’ as if it was a magic button that I could just press, and I believed it.</p>

When I had my baby two years ago, I experienced really bad postpartum anxiety. I was afraid to leave the house with him and checked he was still breathing an unhealthy number of times.<br><br>However, I accepted that it was a huge hormonal shift and life change, so it was normal to feel this way.<br><br>I also had breastfeeding problems and three mastitis infections in the first six months so I forgave myself for feeling negatively about the experience.<br><br>As a society, we never tell women to do that, but we certainly should. Because early motherhood can be very triggering and scary, it certainly was for me.<br><br>Only now I can accept it. All of it.
