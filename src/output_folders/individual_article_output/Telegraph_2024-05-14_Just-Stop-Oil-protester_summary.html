    <p>PRIMARY: Lora Johnson, a 39-year-old Just Stop Oil protester from Suffolk, used a paint-filled fire extinguisher to spray Scotland Yard&#x27;s revolving sign with orange paint in October 2022. Her action was part of coordinated climate demonstrations protesting the government&#x27;s approval of new oil and gas licenses. She was cleared of criminal damage charges after a six-day trial.<br><br>SECONDARY: Other demonstrators blocked the road in front of the Metropolitan Police headquarters along Victoria Embankment as part of the coordinated actions.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: Johnson&#x27;s barrister compared her actions to historical civil rights figures like Rosa Parks and the Suffragettes, arguing that direct action is part of democracy.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral tone, presenting both the protest action and legal proceedings factually without editorial judgment.</p>
