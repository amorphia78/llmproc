    <p>The co-leader of the Green Party said it was &quot;on a roll and very much in the mainstream of politics&quot;.<br><br>Adrian Ramsay, who became the East of England&#x27;s first Green MP by winning the Waveney Valley seat straddling Norfolk and Suffolk, said the party was already making a difference.<br><br>It now has four MPs in Parliament and plays a part in the running of seven councils across the region, including Mid Suffolk, where it has overall control.<br><br>But as its annual conference gets under way, a leading environmental campaigner has called on the party to be more bold and &quot;tell the public some difficult truths&quot;.<br><br>Despite being elected in July, Adrian Ramsay was only able to move into his Westminster office this week.<br><br>It is empty apart from two desks, a sofa and a fridge. He hasn’t had time to unpack.<br><br>Across the corridor, a small team of staff are helping him and the other three Green MPs with constituency correspondence.<br><br>&quot;It hasn’t been ideal,&quot; he said. &quot;People were contacting me as soon as I was elected.&quot;<br><br>But he added the disruption had not stopped him from doing his job.<br><br>He took part in a debate about local health provision this week to raise the issue of dentist shortages.<br><br>&quot;Having four MPs means having more voices in more places. We get called in debates, we can put more issues on the table and push the government to be bolder.<br><br>&quot;So, whether it’s representing constituents or pressing the government to invest in the NHS and take real action to defend our environment, the Greens are there.&quot;<br><br>For the former Norwich City councillor, getting into Parliament along with his colleagues is just part of the Green success story.<br><br>They had another record set of local election results this year and have more than 800 councillors across the country, including 141 in the East of England.<br><br>&quot;We’re on a roll, we’re very much in the mainstream of local politics and we are making a real practical difference to residents every day.<br><br>&quot;At our conference, we will be celebrating but we will also be looking at how we use our increased profile around the country.&quot;</p>

    <p>The wider environmental movement is delighted by the Green Party&#x27;s success but some worry, in becoming mainstream, it may become more cautious when speaking about climate change.<br><br>Norfolk campaigner Rupert Read said the party needed to use its raised profile to be more dramatic in its words and actions.<br><br>&quot;The difficult truth is that climate impacts are coming and we are catastrophically poorly prepared for things like wildfires and flooding and I would love it if the Greens were to spend more time talking about this as an absolute, urgent national priority,&quot; he said.<br><br>Prof Read was a founder of Extinction Rebellion and now runs the Climate Majority Project, which tries to raise awareness of the issue.<br><br>He said the Greens should be &quot;systematically pressurising&quot; the government on climate adaptation and encouraging communities to become resilient.<br><br>&quot;If Greens highlight over and over again the weaknesses in the system and show by their leadership they can do something about it, that will put them in a strong position in future elections.&quot;<br><br>Adrian Ramsay insists Green MPs are holding the government to account but have to be careful how they do it.<br><br>&quot;As a politician, you have to strike a balance,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;You don&#x27;t get very far just by shouting, you have to work behind the scenes with other parties and build relationships to have a real impact on what&#x27;s decided.&quot;<br><br>He will tell the conference his party&#x27;s professionalism in Parliament and local government is one of the reasons it is seeing support and numbers grow year on year.<br><br>And he will tell his party to start preparing for next year&#x27;s local elections, where the Greens stand another chance of doing well.<br><br>Follow East of England news on X, Instagram and Facebook: BBC Beds, Herts &amp; Bucks, BBC Cambridgeshire, BBC Essex, BBC Norfolk, BBC Northamptonshire or BBC Suffolk.</p>
