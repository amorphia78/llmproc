    <p>Up Next<br><br>Four men have been arrested after on suspicion of aggravated trespassing after breaking into Rishi Sunak’s £2,000,000 mansion and taking a dump in his garden.<br><br>An activist wearing a vest which read ‘eat s***’ Rishi’ defecated in the lake at Rishi Sunak’s constituency home in Kirby Sigston, North Yorkshire, and uploaded the footage to social media.<br><br>Youth Demand, who organised the protest, said the defecation was a ‘parting gift’ to the Conservative government.<br><br>Police said they had arrested four men in connection with the incident, including one 52-year-old from London, one 43-year-old from Bolton, one 21-year-old from Manchester, and one 20-year-old from Chichester.<br><br>The group, who describe themselves as ‘a youth resistance campaign fighting for an end to genocide’, said the ‘political system is broken,’ have called on fellow activists to join them for a week of civil disobedience in the run-up to the General Election on July 4.<br><br>It is the second time Mr Sunak’s house has faced such a security breach after Greenpeace activists climbed onto the property and draped it with black banners while the PM was away on a family holiday last year.<br><br>On their website, the group said: ‘As a thank you and a parting gift to Rishi Sunak and the Tories for the last 14 years of service, a Youth Demand supporter has “sunk the Bismarck” in Rishi Sunak’s lake.<br><br>‘Youth Demand is a campaign calling for a two-way arms embargo on Israel and for the incoming UK government to revoke all new oil and gas licences granted since 2021.’<br><br>Before ‘murdering the brown snake’ in Rishi’s yard, activist Oliver, 21, who performed the deed, said: ‘We have so much to thank the Tories for: from crumbling schools, s*** in the rivers and a collapsing NHS; to creating a nation with more food banks than McDonalds and 4.3 million UK children living in poverty.<br><br>‘From allowing their mates to get filthy rich from selling weapons to battle-test on toddlers in Gaza, or by drilling for more oil as the world burns – it’s quite a legacy!”<br><br>‘Yet this s***-show is set to continue with yet another party led by a pathological liar who will be taking office next.</p>

    <p>‘Both Labour and the Tories are content to keep s****ing on Gaza, and on every future generation, by continuing weapons trading with Israel and by not revoking all oil and gas licences granted since 2021. The two party system is just two cheeks of the same arse. We deserve better!’<br><br>A Youth Demand spokesperson said: ‘From Number 10 to Number 2, let’s face it: he’s done a s*** job, and the Tories are facing an electoral wipe-out. As a final goodbye, we’re issuing a “code-brown” to Mr Sunak and his colleagues in government for 14 years of total failure, by delivering them some much needed moral fibre.<br><br>‘They’ve landed us all up s***-creek and so we hope they accept these “gorilla fingers” as a heartfelt gesture of our feelings towards them.’<br><br>‘But although we’ve unloaded some timber, we’re not out of the woods yet. Our political system is broken. Labour has to lose the policies from the bottom-drawer and convince floating voters by putting the skids on arms trading with Israel and flushing all oil and gas projects licensed since 2021- policies which stain the UK’s reputation. It’s a big job, but it’s time to sort s*** out.<br><br>Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
