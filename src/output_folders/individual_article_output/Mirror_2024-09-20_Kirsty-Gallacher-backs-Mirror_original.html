    <p>TV presenter Kirsty Gallacher is the latest voice to speak out in support of the Daily Mirror&#x27;s crusade to ban fur sales in the UK.<br><br>The 48-year-old who lives with her two sons, two dogs and a tortoise has urged the Government to bring in the ban on fur imports. She said: &quot;The fur trade is a cruel and ugly business, subjecting animals to pain and horrendous suffering for frivolous fashion items.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The UK was right to ban fur farming but as long as we keep selling fur from animals overseas, we are complicit in their pain. Wouldn&#x27;t it be great for Britain to be leading the way in animal welfare? What are they waiting for?”<br><br>She joins stars and conservationists including Ricky Gervais, Dame Judy Dench and Chris Packham in backing our call with the Humane Society International/UK for a Fur Free Britain. Kirsty also slammed the latest trend which has seen a return to vintage real fur being worn particularly by Gen Zs, known as the mob wife look, calling it out of touch and “awful”.<br><br>The former Sky Sports news presenter is daughter of Scottish professional golfer Bernard Gallacher, 75. She said her passion for animal welfare started at a young age when she started to question trips to Edinburgh zoo with her parents after “seeing the sadness” in the animals eyes. She has also boycotted marine parks for her children such as Seaworld calling them “disgusting” for locking up dolphins and whales in barren tanks. Kirsty says she also worries about climate change will impact future generations.<br><br>While she has turned to devoting a lot of time to campaigning about animal welfare issues in Parliament, Kirsty said she draws the line at getting involved with protests organised by Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil.<br><br>Kirsty, who now hosts a Saturday afternoon slot on Smooth Radio, said: “I don’t agree with glueing yourself to the road to cause loads of disruption. Ambulances got stuck and carers for the elderly. That kind of action is going to cause deaths. Campaigning is what we need to be doing, to stop the fur trade, puppy farming or the import of foie gras. When I see it on a menu I want to scribble it out. If anyone was to order it in front of me, I would get up from the table.”<br><br>Dogs have been a particularly big part of her life since was a child. She said: &quot;I have been fortunate to have had dogs all my life. Our first two, when we moved from Edinburgh to Wentworth, were a giant schnauzer called Domino. The other was a golden retriever called Thatcher - we didn’t name her I hasten to add, she came to us called that already.”<br><br>She has two dogs at the moment, Frank the cocker spaniel, who was a stray found wandering London during Storm Franklin and a French bulldog called Bertie. Her other rescue, British bulldog Betsy sadly passed away before Christmas.</p>

    <p>Kirsty said: “Betsy was completely broken when we got her in 2015. She was about four years old and had been constantly used for breeding. She was so scared of noises, like the rustling of a plastic bag. She had obviously been through a lot of trauma and had been beaten. It was a slow process nursing her back to life but she began to trust us Betsy was the most beautiful creature. We called her “Milady” as she was the matriarch, the main lady of the house, the boss. We went on a journey together as we were both quite broken at the time but we helped to heal each other. Animals are just incredible companions.”<br><br>Kirsty’s other pet is a tortoise called Theo who she inherited from her best friend’s daughter, BBC sports presenter Gabby Logan, to whom she is godmother to. She added: “I just love being surrounded by animals and my kids keep asking for more. We really will take in anything. They all bring such joy to us and are all firmly part of the family.”<br><br>Fur farming has been banned on ethical grounds in the UK since 2003, however fur from countries including China is still imported into the country. In May 2021 the UK Government launched a Call for Evidence on the UK fur trade, but almost three years on, officials are still withholding the results.<br><br>HSI estimates that the amount of fur imported into the UK from over the last five years (2019-2023) equates to approximately 7 million animals brutally killed for fur fashion, including the equivalent of around one million animals’ worth of fur imported directly from China.<br><br>There are also concerns on a public health risk after millions of animals on fur farms were forced to be culled after a mutated version of covid-19 was detected in 12 workers in Denmark in 2020. Experts warn that farms or wet markets full of sick, distressed and injured animals are virus reservoirs.<br><br>Claire Bass, senior campaigns and public affairs director at Humane Society International/UK, said: “Fur is a shameful trade that belongs in the dustbin of history, and Kirsty&#x27;s right that it is a total double standard to ban fur farming here but then keep importing the same cruelty from overseas.<br><br>“Millions of people back an import ban, which would be a major blow to the global trade, but disappointingly the Government keeps stalling even in spite of the enormous human health risks posed by fur farms, which could very well be the origin of the next pandemic.<br><br>“We&#x27;re so grateful to Kirsty for speaking out about this outdated, unnecessary and dangerous trade and encourage everyone to join her in taking action for animals by signing the petition for a #FurFreeBritain.”<br><br>Sign our Fur Free Britain petition today!</p>
