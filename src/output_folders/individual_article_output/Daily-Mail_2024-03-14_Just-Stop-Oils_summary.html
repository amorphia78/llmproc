    <p>PRIMARY: Phoebe Plummer, 22, a privately-educated Just Stop Oil activist, was arrested for breaching bail conditions after delivering a letter to MP Emily Thornberry&#x27;s house. The arrest was filmed and posted on social media, showing Plummer being detained by several police officers.<br><br>SECONDARY: Plummer was previously arrested in March on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle and sending malicious communications related to an alleged plot to target MPs&#x27; homes. Just Stop Oil had circulated a manual advising activists how to track down politicians&#x27; homes and disrupt them through various means including breaking windows and occupying properties.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article focuses heavily on Plummer&#x27;s privileged background, detailing her expensive private education and family&#x27;s Â£4million Chelsea home, contrasting this with her activist activities.<br><br>TONE: The article takes a negative tone toward the protest, emphasizing the &quot;disruptive&quot; nature of targeting MPs&#x27; homes and framing Plummer&#x27;s actions as threatening democratic values.</p>
