    <p>Up Next<br><br>Nigel Farage has announced he will stand in the General Election and replace Richard Tice as the Reform UK leader.<br><br>Farage made a U-turn as he announced he will stand for the Clacton seat in Essex as a Reform UK candidate – despite previously saying he would not enter the race due to time constraints.<br><br>He told a press conference in south east London on Monday: ‘Difficult though it is, I can’t let down those millions of people, I simply can’t do it, it’d be wrong.<br><br>‘So I have decided I’ve changed my mind, it’s allowed you know, it’s not always a sign of weakness, it could potentially be a sign of strength.<br><br>‘So I am going to stand in this election.’<br><br>Farage said he wants to lead a ‘political revolt,’ adding that ‘nothing in this country works any more’ as the attacked the political establishment, Labour and the Conservatives.<br><br>He said the General Election campaign needs some ‘gingering up.’<br><br>Now that Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice will continues as the party’s chairman.<br><br>Farage is set to launch his campaign officially in Clacton on Tuesday at midday.<br><br>His new statement comes just few days before the deadline for registration.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Conservatives have marked Pride Month by proposing a change in the Equality Act to allow for a ban on trans women in single-sex spaces.<br><br>Scroll down or click here to go straight to our live updates<br><br>Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said the move would end confusion over who can be incarcerated in women’s prisons and who is allowed to play women’s sport.<br><br>Labour has been attempting to strengthen its defence credentials by affirming its support for the nuclear deterrent.<br><br>Last night, the party announced a ‘triple lock’ which would involve the continued construction of planned new nuclear-armed subs, the maintenance of the constant at-sea presence, and the delivery of all future upgrades.<br><br>Defence has been used as an attack line against Labour by the Tories for several months, a holdover from the Corbyn years when the party took a strong position against military action.<br><br>Before parliament was dissolved, the government would frequently point out that shadow foreign secretary David Lammy and shadow deputy prime minister Angela Rayner previously voted against the Trident nuclear weapons programme.<br><br>The Labour and Conservative battle buses launched at the weekend, joining the Liberal Democrats’ Yellow Hammer 1 on roads around the country.<br><br>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer will be travelling to opposite ends of England today, with Sunak visiting the south-east and Starmer going to the north-west.<br><br>The ex-Ukip leader appeared confident when he announced his comeback into politics as the candidate for Reform UK in Clacton, Essex.<br><br>He predicted the Tories will be in opposition after the election, saying the party is divided and ‘right now they don’t stand for a damn thing.’<br><br>Two weeks ago, the controversial politician said he would focus on getting Donald Trump re-elected as the next US President rather than stand himself.<br><br>He said he had ‘changed’ his mind, adding that it is not ‘always a sign of weakness.’<br><br>But who is the 60-year-old politician and presenter?<br><br>Read more about his personal life here.<br><br>Residents in the seaside town expressed a mixed reaction to Nigel Farage’s decision to stand as the Reform UK candidate for the constituency at the General Election.<br><br>The party’s founder announced on Monday that he will be contesting the Essex seat and is taking over from Richard Tice as party leader, despite previously saying now was not the right time for him to stand.<br><br>As the announcement was made, the high street of the seaside town was quiet despite the mild weather and people did not seem keen to speak about the upcoming election or about Farage’s announcement.<br><br>However, Edel Ruddy, 58, who has lived in Clacton for 40 years, told the PA news agency she would ‘definitely’ be voting for the Brexiteer on July 4 as she believed ‘his heart was in the right place’ and he would ‘stand up’ for the local area.<br><br>Ms Ruddy added she felt it was ‘unfair’ that businesses in Clacton were closing down and that the town has been “forgotten”.<br><br>She added: ‘No-one wants to fight for Clacton.’<br><br>When asked what she supported about Farage’s politics, Ms Ruddy said: ‘I think he’s the sort of person that will try and encourage people to do what they can to make things better.<br><br>‘It’s the fact that he wants to try, especially here in Clacton.<br><br>‘Clacton is so forgotten in so many ways – it’s just utterly ridiculous and unfair.’<br><br>Sophie Cassen, 21, a catering industry worker who works and lives in Clacton, said she would not be voting in the upcoming election and that she did not know who Farage is.<br><br>When asked for her thoughts on the former MEP’s announcement, she said: ‘I don’t know who he is.<br><br>‘I don’t really keep up to that sort of stuff – I don’t really pay attention to politics.<br><br>‘I just don’t really know how to – I don’t really go on the news or anything like that.’<br><br>George Charalambous, 59, who moved to Clacton from east London around five months ago, said he thought voting for the Reform UK candidate was a ‘wasted vote’ as Farage ‘wouldn’t achieve much’ if elected to Parliament.<br><br>The former factory worker said he would be voting for Labour but would also consider voting tactically either for Reform UK or the Liberal Democrats in order to defeat the Conservative candidate.<br><br>When asked for his opinion on Mr Farage’s decision to contest the Essex seat, he said: ‘He’s not going to achieve much because we’ve done Brexit.<br><br>‘I am a Labour supporter, so would I vote for him?<br><br>‘If he was a second choice, I say yeah, I probably would.<br><br>‘At the end of the day, it’s sort of tactics really – I mean Clacton is a Conservative area, so obviously I want someone else to win.’<br><br>Jason Matthews, 51, who works in the care industry, said he ‘loved’ Farage and welcomed the news that he would be standing in Clacton.<br><br>He said: ‘I just love him as a person.<br><br>‘Given the chance, I feel like he should be leading the Conservative Party really to be honest.’<br><br>When asked whether there were any Reform UK policies in particular that he supported, Mr Matthews replied: ‘Not really – I just like Nigel Farage as a person.’<br><br>He added: ‘He’s straight down the line, honest, says it how it is.<br><br>‘I wouldn’t vote Labour or Conservative this time around because I just don’t trust either of them.’<br><br>Farage has stood – and failed – seven times to gain election as an MP.<br><br>His most recent attempt took place in South Thanet, Kent, in 2015, where the then Ukip leader finished second behind the Tories, who secured a 2,812 majority.<br><br>The Conservative Party revealed its new election broadcast video today titled ‘A Secure Future.’<br><br>However, social media users were quick to point out that the Union Jack appeared to fly the ‘wrong way up’ on the video.<br><br>Up Next<br><br>Pippa Crear, political editor with the Guardian, wrote on X (formerly Twitter): ‘Oh dear. The Conservatives’ first election broadcast shows the union flag flying the wrong way up, which is a distress signal…’<br><br>Oh dear. The Conservativesâ first election broadcast shows the union flag flying the wrong way up, which is a distress signalâ¦(h/t @Markwmw_02) pic.twitter.com/smWO5y7nHC<br><br>Rishi Sunak revealed his go-to peri-peri dish while on the campaign trail.<br><br>Like scores of other foodies, the Prime Minister is a fan of the high street chicken restaurant.<br><br>He detailed his order after being quizzed by a girls’ team at Wantage Town FC.<br><br>Sunak said the answer was ‘very easy, actually, because I had it twice last week.’<br><br>His Nando’s order consists of half a chicken, cooked medium, chips and broccoli.<br><br>Up Next<br><br>The players, aged between 12 to 15, also asked the PM his favourite football club, which he said was Southampton.<br><br>He said his current favourite song is When The Saints Go Marching In, an anthem for the team.<br><br>Sunak has previously said he probably does not meet the bar to be considered a ‘Swiftie,’ according to his daughters.<br><br>He revealed he is ‘slowly getting into’ country music, with The Cowboy In Me by Tim McGraw featuring on his current playlist after first hearing it in the TV series Yellowstone.<br><br>When the girls asked if he ever wandered the corridors of Number 10 Downing Street in his pyjamas, he jokingly replied: ‘When no one is looking, I do.’<br><br>Grant Shapps hung up the phone live on air during a Sky News broadcast.<br><br>A new YouGov poll suggests that the Conservative defence secretary is likely to lose his seat for Welwyn Hatfield.<br><br>But the 55-year-old appeared to be not in the mood to hash it out live on air.<br><br>Sky News deputy political editor Sam Coates saw Shapps was trying to call him when Coates was presenting the polls’ results.<br><br>He did say hello and laugh, but he quickly hung up after being told ‘you’re about to lose your seat.’<br><br>Watch a video of the exchange here.<br><br>Shapps appeared on Sky News again hours after the mishap to talk about the General Election, smiling and seemingly in good spirits.<br><br>When asked by Sophy Ridge what happened, he said he ‘hadn’t realised Sky had turned into some big Michael MacIntyre show.’<br><br>‘The only poll that matters is the one on election day,’ he added.<br><br>If the General Election was held tomorrow, Labour would win a 194-seat majority, according to the pollster YouGov.<br><br>It would be the party’s highest number of parliamentary seats since Stanley Baldwin took a majority of 208 in 1924 and beating Tony Blair’s 1997 landslide.<br><br>Up Next<br><br>The Tories could lose 232 seats, meaning they would be left with just 140 parliamentarians in the House of Commons.<br><br>Lib Dems would quadruple their seats, while the SNP would face a huge loss.<br><br>Some political heavyweights such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and the chancellor Jeremy Hunt are at risk of losing their seats among dozens of others.<br><br>See the list of names hanging on a balance here.<br><br>The politician announced he will stand in the General Election after previously saying he did not have the time.<br><br>Up Next<br><br>He is now standing as the parliamentary candidate for Clacton, Essex, in the election after an announcement at a press conference in south east London.<br><br>He also revealed he is the new leader of Reform UK after taking over from Richard Tice, who will continue as the chairman of the party.<br><br>Farage said his party is to ‘become the voice of opposition in the next parliament,’ which he claimed the Conservatives are ‘incapable’ of being.<br><br>He said he believed Reform UK could get more votes in the election that the Conservative Party.<br><br>We’ve got the results in from the first of three big polls that are coming today – lucky us.<br><br>This one come from the market research company Redfield &amp; Wilton, and they put a lot of effort into it.<br><br>Their sample size of 10,000 is considerably bigger than most other polls we’ve been relying on to gauge the public mood so far.<br><br>But it tells a similar story to everything we’ve seen before.

    <p>Rishi Sunak was enjoying a coffee by the river with voters in Henley-on-Thames earlier this afternoon, when a boat full of dayglo orange signs showed up on the river behind him.<br><br>As it quietly sailed past the oblivious PM, it became clear who was on board: Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper and her team.<br><br>They took their moment in the spotlight and ran with it, waving to the TV cameras filming.<br><br>And to his credit, Sunak was fairly snappy with a retort himself.<br><br>Classic Lib Dems, always selling voters down the river. https://t.co/HJ0a9neJzb<br><br>Let’s assume for a minute that Nigel Farage is going to announce at 4pm that he has changed his mind and will run at the General Election.<br><br>How likely is it that he’d win?<br><br>It’s a fair question – he may have been elected five consecutive times to the European Parliament, but his UK Parliament record is more sketchy.<br><br>He’s run seven times in six different constituencies over the past 30 years, and has never won.<br><br>But if everything falls into place, that may be about to change. In January, Survation ran a poll with the Sunday Times asking the people of Clacton – thought to be the most likely target for Farage – how they might vote.<br><br>Firstly, they included the current prospective Reform UK candidate, a man named Anthony Mack. He came third (18%) behind incumbent Conservative Giles Watling (37%) and the hypothetical Labour candidate (30%).<br><br>Secondly, they swapped Mack for Farage. This time, Reform UK stormed to victory with 37% of the vote, compared to 27% for Watling and 23% for the Labour candidate.<br><br>For context, Clacton is the only constituency that was ever won at a General Election by Farage’s old party Ukip. Douglas Carswell won it after defecting from the Tories – though he later left Ukip too, to sit as an independent.<br><br>Of course, it’s far from a done deal. The polling was six months ago, a long time in politics… and of course, we don’t actually know if he’s going to announce he’s standing yet.<br><br>Ever since he announced he wasn’t going to stand in the July 4 General Election, Nigel Farage has appeared a lot on our screens.<br><br>There was even a moment on Question Time this week where Fiona Bruce asked him why he was popping up so much as a non-candidate.<br><br>(‘You invited me on!’ he said. ‘We wanted Lee Anderson,’ she said.)<br><br>But could he be about to U-turn?<br><br>Earlier this morning, the ex-Ukip leader – who serves as Reform’s honorary president – posted this cryptic tweet.<br><br>I will be making an Emergency General Election announcement at 4pm today.<br><br>The deadline for registering as a candidate is June 7, so he still has some time if he has changed his mind.<br><br>But keep in mind that the last time a politician made a pre-announcement like that, it was a bit of a damp squib.<br><br>Last month, Tory MP Rehman Chishti got journalists hot and bothered when he tweeted about a ‘personal statement’ he was about to make, with some wondering if he was about to defect.<br><br>In fact, he just wanted to say that his fiancee had said yes when he asked her to marry him.<br><br>Here’s a clip from the Today programme, with Kemi Badenoch talking about the new proposals to change the Equality Act.<br><br>Sorry, this video isn&#x27;t available any more.<br><br>Inevitably, the Labour leader was also asked about the members of his frontbench team who voted not to renew Trident in 2016.<br><br>There are around a dozen of them, including shadow deputy PM Angela Rayner and shadow foreign secretary David Lammy – who said he based his decision on his Christian faith.<br><br>Keir Starmer said: ‘This is a changed Labour Party, and the most important thing is that I voted in favour of the nuclear deterrent.<br><br>‘If we are privileged to come in to serve, I will serve as the prime minister of this country, and my commitment to the nuclear deterrent is absolute.<br><br>‘Absolute, that is why I voted for it, that is why I’ve changed this party, and that’s why it will be the number one issue for a Labour government.’<br><br>When pressed on the point by another reporter, he said: ‘I’ve got my whole shadow cabinet behind me on this. We have changed the Labour Party, and I know full well that national security, the defence of our country, is the number one issue.<br><br>He added: ‘I lead from the front, I’ve always led from the front.’<br><br>It’s a classic question to ask potential future prime ministers, but certainly a tricky one: would you be prepared to give the order to fire nuclear weapons?<br><br>Chris Mason was the one asking it to Keir Starmer this morning, at a campaign stop in Bury, Greater Manchester.<br><br>The Labour leader was there to talk about defence and the nuclear deterrent, so it seemed particularly appropriate.<br><br>He said: ‘It’s fundamental, it’s a vital part of our defence, and of course that means we have to be prepared to use it.<br><br>‘Nobody who aspires to be prime minister would set out the circumstances in which it would be used, that would be irresponsible, but it is there as a vital part of our defence.<br><br>‘So of course we would have to be prepared to use it.’<br><br>Greenpeace have a question for Keir Starmer, which they’ve hung over Westminster Bridge in central London.<br><br>Somewhat unexpectedly, though, it doesn’t appear to have anything to do with the environment.<br><br>They’re asking: ‘Will Labour stop arming Israel?’<br><br>According to Greenpeace’s website, the two issues – Gaza and the climate – are strongly linked.<br><br>It says: ‘The bombing of Gaza has left rivers of sewage, dirty, undrinkable water, contaminated land, and toxic air.<br><br>‘Experts are warning that the conflict will leave the land uninhabitable.’<br><br>The banner comes a day after more than 100 celebrities signed a joint letter urging Starmer to halt arms sales to Israel if he becomes prime minister.<br><br>They included Steve Coogan, Paloma Faith, Michael Rosen and Miriam Margoyles.<br><br>A bit more from BBC radio interviews this morning – Kemi Badenoch has been grilled over the technicalities of her plan to ban trans people from single-sex spaces on Radio 4’s Today programme.<br><br>When asked by Mishal Husain if people visiting a rape crisis centre would need to ensure their original, unamended birth certificate categorised them as female, the equalities minister implied it was a matter of whether someone looked female enough.<br><br>She said: ‘What is happening at the moment is that people come to these centres and they are visibly of a different sex.<br><br>‘You don’t always need your birth certificate when you are going to the toilet and so on, so forth. The point I’m making is the everyday scenarios people will be experiencing.’<br><br>Questioned over whether the same will apply to women’s prisons, Badenoch said prison authorities ‘will know’ someone’s biological sex.<br><br>If a trans woman had undergone gender reassignment surgery, ‘special circumstances can be created for them, they can have more privacy within a men’s prison’, she said.<br><br>Shadow defence secretary John Healey was on Five Live this morning to talk about Labour’s announcement on the nuclear deterrent last night.<br><br>But he was also asked about the Conservatives’ big policy announcement, on proposals to ban trans people from single-sex spaces by changing the Equality Act.<br><br>Asked if Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was right to propose amending the act, Healey said: ‘No, he’s not right, it’s not needed.<br><br>‘This is an election distraction from the core issues that really matter to people like the cost of living and the defence of the country.<br><br>‘Why he’s not right is that the Equality Act, which Labour brought in in 2010 and the Tories opposed, already protects single-sex spaces for biological women, it already defines what a woman is.<br><br>‘What’s certainly needed is clearer guidance for service providers about how to safeguard those women-only spaces.’<br><br>The Tories hopped straight on this answer, sending over a rebuttal from equalities minister Kemi Badenoch.<br><br>She said: ‘Under Labour, biological men will be allowed access to women-only spaces.<br><br>‘Labour think protecting women is a ‘distraction’. This is no surprise – Keir Starmer has flip-flopped on what a woman is, he long campaigned to introduce gender self-identification, and today he is refusing to back our commitment to rewrite the Equality Act to make clear that sex means “biological sex”.<br><br>‘While Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a clear plan to protect women and girls, it is clear Keir Starmer and the Labour Party will not stand up for women.’<br><br>It’s not the most ambitious policy announcement in the world – all Labour have done is reaffirm they’d take exactly the same tack with the nuclear deterrent as the current government.<br><br>But it’s a move that is designed to show how much the party has changed in the just over four years since it was led by Jeremy Corbyn.<br><br>The former leader, a lifelong campaigner against nuclear proliferation and critic of Nato, was explicitly against the Trident programme and demonstrated that position in numerous votes.<br><br>But he came into conflict with some in his party – including his shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith – who said it was necessary for the nation’s security.<br><br>In July 2016, Labour split into factions during a vote on the renewal of Trident, with Corbyn voting against alongside current shadow foreign secretary David Lammy and shadow deputy PM Angela Rayner.<br><br>Those votes have been brought up numerous times by the Tories in the Commons recently, as they seek to cast the opposition as weak on defence.<br><br>Today, Corbyn’s successor Keir Starmer is in Greater Manchester speaking to veterans ahead of the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday.<br><br>His Labour Party says it is committed to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence, along with the ‘nuclear deterrent triple lock’.<br><br>He said: ‘National security will always come first in the changed Labour Party I lead. Keeping our country safe is the bedrock of stability that the British people rightly expect from their government.<br><br>‘My message to them is clear: Labour has changed. No longer the party of protest, Labour is the Party of national security.<br><br>‘In the face of increasing threats to national security, actions will speak louder than words.<br><br>‘That’s why, alongside our unshakeable commitment to Nato, an incoming Labour government will introduce a ‘triple lock’ commitment on our nuclear deterrent – providing vital protection for the UK and our Nato allies in the years ahead, as well as supporting thousands of high paying jobs across the UK.<br><br>The Tories are arguably most comfortable on the subject of gender and trans rights, where they like to needle Labour and Keir Starmer over the importance of biological sex.<br><br>And now, on the first Monday of Pride Month, the topic has appeared on the campaign trail for the first time.<br><br>It’s almost certainly not going to be the last.<br><br>The announcement – made, as all the big Conservative policy announcements seem to be, at 10.30pm – comes off the back of correspondence between equalities minister Kemi Badenoch and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) last year.<br><br>At the time, the EHRC said defining ‘sex’ as biological sex in the Equality Act would bring greater legal clarity.<br><br>What the Tories did not mention in their announcement was that the EHRC also warned that any change should be carefully considered due to ‘possible disadvantages for trans men and trans women’.<br><br>Nevertheless, both Badenoch and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have said the move will end ‘confusion’.<br><br>Sunak said: ‘The Conservatives believe that making this change in law will enhance protections in a way that respects the privacy and dignity of everyone in society.<br><br>‘We are taking an evidence-led approach to this issue so we can continue to build a secure future for everyone across the whole country.’<br><br>Badenoch added: ‘Whether it is rapists being housed in women’s prisons, or instances of men playing in women’s sports where they have an unfair advantage, it is clear that public authorities and regulatory bodies are confused about what the law says on sex and gender and when to act – often for fear of being accused of transphobia, or not being inclusive.<br><br>‘That is why we are today pledging that, if we form a government after the election, we will clarify that sex in the law means biological sex and not new, redefined meanings of the word.’<br><br>The party would also ‘establish in law’ that gender recognition is a reserved matter, it said – referencing the Scottish Government’s attempt to introduce self ID, which was struck down by Westminster.<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: Prey for cyber-sharks, medieval justice and the politics of spivvery<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: The Metro daily cartoon by Guy Venables<br><br>Arrow<br><br>MORE: Inside Germany’s preparation for ‘high risk’ England Euros match<br><br>Never miss an edition of your favourite free daily newspaper.<br><br>This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.
