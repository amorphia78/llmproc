        <h1>Greta Thunberg detained at The Hague climate demonstration</h1><p>PRIMARY: Greta Thunberg and about 100 other protesters were detained by police after attempting to block the A12 highway near the Dutch parliament in The Hague. The protesters, organized by Extinction Rebellion, demanded an end to all fossil fuel subsidies. Thunberg stated they were responding to a &quot;planetary emergency&quot; to prevent climate refugees.<br><br>SECONDARY: A small group also sat down on another road and were detained after ignoring police orders to leave.</p>

    <p><br><br>OTHER FOCAL: The article mentions Thunberg&#x27;s previous legal troubles, including a February acquittal in London for blocking an oil and gas conference, and her history of inspiring global youth climate activism since 2018.<br><br>TONE: The article maintains a neutral, factual tone in reporting the protest and detention.</p></body></html>
