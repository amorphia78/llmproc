        <h1>Scrap law making schools serve meat, urges Labour donor</h1><p>Major Labour donor Dale Vince says he wants to talk to the new government about scrapping compulsory meat and dairy in school meals in England.<br><br>The green entrepreneur, who has donated more than £5m to Labour, says vegan meals are healthier and better for the environment.<br><br>He is campaigning for an end to all farming of animals, which he says is now the biggest driver of the climate crisis.<br><br>He told a fringe meeting at Labour&#x27;s conference that his company, Devil&#x27;s Kitchen, already supplies vegan food to &quot;one in four&quot; primary schools.<br><br>But he added: &quot;There are schools which want to go further. They don&#x27;t want meat and dairy on the menu perhaps every day of the week or even at all.<br><br>&quot;But it is the law of the land. I am hoping to have a conversation with the new government to encourage them to change the law.&quot;<br><br>Government guidance issued to schools in England says they must serve a &quot;wide range of foods across the week&quot;.<br><br>This must include fresh fruit and vegetables, some milk and dairy and &quot;a portion of meat or poultry on three or more days each week&quot;.<br><br>Mr Vince said it was now clear that a vegan diet was healthier than eating meat and dairy products, adding: &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t be forcing these unhealthy products on to our kids.&quot;</p><p>He told the meeting he also planned to talk to the education secretary about incorporating &quot;climate and sustainability&quot; into the primary school curriculum.<br><br>He denied he was against farmers, insisting that he did not want to kill the industry but allow it to be &quot;reborn&quot;.<br><br>&quot;[Farmers] have to be part of the move to net zero, they have to move away from animal agriculture, we know that the science tells us that - and they already grow grass to feed to animals.&quot;<br><br>Mr Vince has donated more than £5m to Labour through his company Ecotricity since Sir Keir Starmer became leader in 2020.<br><br>Asked after the meeting if he planned to make further donations, he said: &quot;It&#x27;s not the kind of thing I have a plan for. I just do it when I can and when I think they need it, which is usually when there is an election on.&quot;<br><br>The businessman said he had stopped funding activist group Just Stop Oil, after Sir Keir came under attack over it.<br><br>&quot;I eventually felt it was unhelpful, which was why I stopped funding Just Stop Oil and began focusing on stopping the Tories,&quot; he said.</p></body></html>
