        <h1>Third person arrested after Stonehenge sprayed with orange paint powder</h1><h2>A man in his 30s has been detained, following the arrest of two other people after the incident more than a week ago.</h2><p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil protesters wearing white shirts ran up to Stonehenge and sprayed orange paint powder on several stones of the prehistoric monument before sitting cross-legged on grass. The protesters demanded the next UK government agree a plan with other countries to end extraction and burning of fossil fuels by 2030. Members of the public tried to stop them by dragging them away.</p>
