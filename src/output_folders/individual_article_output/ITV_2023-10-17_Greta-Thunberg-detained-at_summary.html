    <p>PRIMARY: Greta Thunberg and dozens of other protesters blocked Hamilton Place outside London&#x27;s InterContinental hotel, which was hosting an Energy Intelligence Forum for oil and gas company executives. The 20-year-old Swedish activist was detained by police, with five people arrested for obstructing a highway. Protesters used banners, pink umbrellas, and smoke flares while chanting &quot;oily money out&quot; and demanding cancellation of the conference, arguing fossil fuel companies deliberately slow renewable energy transition for profit.</p>
