        <h1>Just Stop Oil protestors throw soup over Van Gogh paintings again as onlookers horrified</h1><p>PRIMARY: Three Just Stop Oil activists threw soup over two Van Gogh Sunflowers paintings at the National Gallery&#x27;s &quot;Poets and Lovers&quot; exhibition. The protesters demanded an end to new oil and gas projects, calling imprisoned activists &quot;prisoners of conscience.&quot; All three were arrested and the paintings remained unharmed.<br><br>SECONDARY: This action occurred hours after two other Just Stop Oil members, Phoebe Plummer (23) and Anna Holland (22), were jailed for previously damaging a Van Gogh Sunflowers frame with tomato soup in 2022, causing Â£10,000 damage.</p>
