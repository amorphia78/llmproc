    <p>‘I don’t feel proud. Sorry, I just don’t.’<br><br>These words, uttered by Nemo – my older (then 65, now 75 years old) trans friend – in 2013 broke my heart. He’s softly spoken and we were sitting in a noisy Wetherspoons having a curry.<br><br>Nemo was born in the 1940s and came out as ‘not a girl’ to his grandad when he was 14 years old after the death of his mother. As a result, his grandfather wanted him out of the way so took him to an NHS facility in Manchester and left him there.<br><br>Under the ‘care’ of the NHS, this small and scared teenager was subjected to ridiculing practices like taking his clothes off, being drugged and electro shock ‘treatment’ in the hope it would lead to hormones and surgery.<br><br>He endured this terrible treatment for two years before turning 16 years old and electing to leave the facility as soon as he realised he could. He got up and walked out of the doors with just the clothes on his back.<br><br>Nemo’s story is heartbreaking, but I am so thankful that we’ve been friends since he reached out to me after I took part in a documentary series called My Transexual Summer on C4 in 2011.<br><br>Listening to the stories of trans elders like Nemo reminds me that trans people have always existed. This is both comforting and shocking due to what they risked and endured to be themselves.<br><br>In contrast to Nemo, I was a late bloomer. I came out as trans in the dregs of my 20s, lacking the knowledge and courage to do it earlier.<br><br>The day I told my parents, I had a phone call with my mum and she told me what time they were coming over later. Suddenly, she asked if I had a cold after registering that my voice was an octave lower. At that point, I had been taking testosterone for two months – long enough to know it was the right decision for me, which was a massive relief.<br><br>I vaguely agreed that I had a sore throat (an effect of my larynx thickening) so it wasn’t technically a lie. I hung up the phone and then paced around my home for the next few hours – cleaning to distract my mind while preparing for their arrival.<br><br>When they came over, I sat them down and said ‘you know how I’ve always struggled, walked the line of gender and been very androgynous?’ My dad, not known for being overly zealous, stopped me in my tracks.<br><br>Putting his coffee down, he reassured me: ‘I think I know where you’re going with this, and I support you 100%.’ I turned to my mum and explained a bit more about my journey to be ‘me’.<br><br>With tears streaming down her cheeks (one of the only times I’d ever seen her cry) my mother initially had some concerns, but now I’m the dapper son they never knew they wanted. In fact, we attended a beach picnic this year at the first ever Trans Pride Hastings and it felt like we’d gone full circle.<br><br>Once my parents realised they weren’t losing anyone and were gaining a happy child, they started to show their support by saving articles on trans issues, attending Trans Pride events and welcoming my partner into the family.<br><br>I am one of the lucky ones.<br><br>I know that many other trans people – especially elders in our community – aren’t so fortunate. Some of them went through harrowing ordeals, such as family rejection, job loss, and electro-shock therapy just to be themselves. That’s why it’s so important to me to connect with them.<br><br>Like retired nurse Alice, who – just like myself – is keen to catch-up for lost years. Being trans often means a very non-linear life path.<br><br>After noticing Alice at various poetry and music events around Brighton and Hastings (where I spent my angsty teenage years) – often alone – I wanted to get to know her.<br><br>So I cornered her at a round table as she sat rehearsing lines to herself, waiting to go on stage to recite some new poetry. Alice was rocking her white hair (which was soon-after dyed a trademark green). Since she’d seen the reality TV series I’d been on, it felt easier for me to cut to the chase.<br><br>I bought her a whiskey and told her about co-founding an ongoing film project called My Genderation. We’d been commissioned to make 25 short films on trans lives in the UK, so Alice invited me to her one-bedroom flat and I brought my camera kit.<br><br>In the short documentary film released in 2014, she was so open and honest about her journey. In turn, the project had a transformative effect on her wellbeing by representing herself back to her.<br><br>It showed her the way I see her – as a caring, creative being. It also allowed people to get to know an otherwise shy and sensitive poet, which helped to break the ice when she’d turn up at events.<br><br>Ever since, I’ve been able to connect with more older trans people, and in 2019 I was commissioned to do a series of films about older trans people in Wales for the Trans Ageing Project called Growing Older as Me.</p>

    <p>It’s through this series that I connected deeply with so many people, including 56-year-old trans man Dave, who found love and transitioned later in life. His story touched me because he’s from a small village in the valleys in Wales, and he’s just so matter-of-fact about who he is.<br><br>Then there’s Cat Burton, a 69-year-old retired British Airways pilot, who came out as a trans woman at the age of 58. She reminds us that, despite a fantastic career and a family, the need to be seen as ourselves is something that will always crop up and never truly goes away.<br><br>I feel blessed to have encountered some incredible gender diverse people who, despite all odds, have lived to an older age – some who are close friends.<br><br>I can’t help but wonder how many stories of trans lives have been buried though.<br><br>This feels like the first time in British history that we have trans elders that have been allowed to grow old as themselves, but society is not fully equipped to meet their needs or help them as they should.<br><br>Sadly, LGBTQ+ people at large are facing challenges in places such as nursing homes or later life care, and have even been separated from their partners or forced to go back into the closet.<br><br>Transgender people have very specific needs that need to be addressed so that they can live the last part of their life with dignity. This includes trans women who have to wear wigs, or who need to take care of their facial hair.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times. Then, one day, he opened his front door and started walking. He didn&#x27;t stop for three years, by which time he&#x27;d walked the coast of the UK and improved his mental health.<br><br>Writer Azania Patel shares her worst date series for our So, How Did it Go? series. She fancied her date - until he admitted to being a Just Stop Oil protester.<br><br>Labour MP Dawn Butler shines a light on the small change the Conservatives have made recently that could help them steal the election. She reckons you didn&#x27;t even notice.<br><br>And finally, mum-of-two Kellie Whitehead recalls the time she took &#x27;snus&#x27; with her 17-year-old son. She says she was overwhelmed by the strength of the nicotine pouch and now has a warning for parents.<br><br>Trans people also often have different bodies to what’s expected and might have specific care needs as a result of various surgeries. Sadly, this isn’t necessarily knowledge that care homes have, or are equipped or trained to deal with.<br><br>As for Nemo, I know that he is haunted by memories of the clanging of the pipes and doors slamming in the communal bathroom next to his room for those two long years in the hospital. The rest of his life hasn’t been great for him either – that’s why he told me he doesn’t feel proud to be himself.<br><br>It broke my heart. Maybe if he had been raised in a different time, he would be able to feel proud about who he is.<br><br>That’s why I dedicated my Trans Pride colouring book to him, because no one should have to feel shame about who they are. Society is wrong for making people feel that way, and I wish he could see that the shame isn’t his, but those who failed to support him.<br><br>I’m so thankful to know him. He is a treasure to be protected.<br><br>It’s so important to keep stories like this alive and to look after our ageing LGBTQ+ population.<br><br>So while it’s vital to look towards the future and continue fighting for a better world for all of us, we cannot forget our trans elders and the stories of their struggles. So that, one day, they can hopefully say they finally feel proud to be themselves.<br><br>Pride and Joy is a series spotlighting the first-person positive, affirming and joyful stories of transgender, non-binary, gender fluid and gender non-conforming people.
