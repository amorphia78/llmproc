    <p>I felt sick as I read the news that a man had raped a sleeping woman on the Tube.<br><br>The horrific circumstances came to light this week after Ryan Johnston, 37, was sentenced to nine years for his crimes, including the rape of this woman, attempted rape, two counts of sexual assault, and one count of outraging public decency.<br><br>My heart broke for his 20-year-old victim. My hatred for this man came pouring out. Tears brimmed as I read that no one else on the Tube stepped in to help the victim.<br><br>Even knowing what some men can get away with on public transport, I was shocked that one could actually rape a woman on a Tube.<br><br>I was not surprised, however, that no one intervened. Yes, we can put it down to fear – who actually wants to confront someone actually perpetrating violence?<br><br>You would hope something as horrendous as this would make people actually engage in the protection of their fellow passenger – that perhaps with enough power, they could restrain this man – but my own experience has taught me to lower my expectations.<br><br>I’ve been sexually harassed and assaulted on public transport and never once has anyone stepped in to offer their allyship. My friends who have found themselves victims of unwanted attention have also been in the same boat.<br><br>Just this year, I was standing on a Tube platform when a man walked past and brazenly swept his hand across my bum, as if it was his to touch.<br><br>It was subtle enough that he could deny it if questioned, but enough for me to feel violated. It wasn’t a busy platform, he had no excuse to be that close to me.<br><br>When I was 14 and on my way to school, a man double my age cornered me on a bus with his Rottweiler and asked repeatedly to go on a date with me. Pinning me in so I couldn’t leave and riling his dog up every time I said no, or pointed out that I was a child.<br><br>No one on that packed bus – even those in earshot – did anything to step in.<br><br>I’ve been masturbated at, stared at, had a man use the confined quarters of the Tube as an excuse to press his erection into my lower back (again, I was 15 and on my way to school).<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times. Then, one day, he opened his front door and started walking. He didn&#x27;t stop for three years, by which time he&#x27;d walked the coast of the UK and improved his mental health.<br><br>Writer Azania Patel shares her worst date series for our So, How Did it Go? series. She fancied her date - until he admitted to being a Just Stop Oil protester.<br><br>Labour MP Dawn Butler shines a light on the small change the Conservatives have made recently that could help them steal the election. She reckons you didn&#x27;t even notice.<br><br>And finally, mum-of-two Kellie Whitehead recalls the time she took &#x27;snus&#x27; with her 17-year-old son. She says she was overwhelmed by the strength of the nicotine pouch and now has a warning for parents.</p>

    <p>I understand that in the cases of the staring and the man pressing his penis against me, unless I said anything, other passengers were probably unaware and thus unable to do anything to help.<br><br>And that’s something to be aware of – a lot of sexual harassment and assault is subtle. Maybe I myself have been in close proximity to it and never realised. Maybe we all have.<br><br>But in the cases of the dog, the wanking, and the bum graze, I wish someone had come to my defence. Yes, so I felt safer, but also to make me feel seen.<br><br>As women, we’re so used to downplaying the horrible things we’ve been through. Maybe I imagined it, maybe he really did just accidentally graze me, maybe he didn’t hear when he said I was 14?<br><br>So having a fellow passenger say, ‘hey, that’s not right’, means the world.<br><br>It means that we’re not overreacting when our body and space has been invaded. It means that another person has recognised how painful this has been for us.<br><br>I would have never got justice against any of these men. They never would have faced any repercussions. But if I could have felt less alone in those moments, it would have been something.<br><br>I obviously wasn’t on the Tube when this poor woman was attacked.<br><br>It’s easy to say I’d be the first to step in and defend her when I’ll never know, but I can’t fathom how anyone can stay silent in the face of a woman being raped.<br><br>I am grateful that a French national, who was travelling with his 11-year-old son, phoned the police and reported the attack. He helped this woman secure some form of justice.<br><br>What I would like to see when this happens again though – because I’m in no doubt that this will happen again someday – is for it to be at most an attempted rape.<br><br>For fellow passengers to step in and prevent another woman becoming a victim of a crime so heinous that it will impact her life forever.<br><br>And for those who stand by when witnessing less severe forms of sexual harassment, at least acknowledge the victim.<br><br>It’s the least she deserves.<br><br>Do you have a story you’d like to share?
