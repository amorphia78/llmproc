        <h1>I’m constantly told I don’t look ‘gay enough’</h1><p>‘If I didn’t know you, I would never have guessed you were queer. You’re very straight-passing.’<br><br>Those are the words a friend of mine said to me while at a house party recently – basically saying that I don’t look gay enough.<br><br>While I pretended to be nonchalant about it, inside I felt confused and hurt.<br><br>As a plus-sized bisexual Muslim woman – who wears mostly chic clothing, with lots of block colour, shorts skirts, sundresses, flower patterns and ‘girly’ looks – it’s not the first time I’ve been told I’m straight-passing. And it probably won’t be the last.<br><br>I’m originally from India but I now live in England after moving to London last year.<br><br>Being LGBTQ+ in my home country was so daunting that – for 23 years of my life – I was pretty convinced I was straight because the alternative was life-altering.<br><br>Despite homosexuality being decriminalised in India in 2018, it is still widely unaccepted. Many people have been entirely cut off from family and support systems, while in extreme cases, some are murdered in what is said to be an ‘honour crime’.<br><br>Not to mention there is also a high possibility of being forced into a heteronormative arranged marriage regardless of your preferences.<br><br>So for me, I never even entertained the idea that I could be anything but straight.<br><br>Then, around three years ago, aged 23, while still living in Delhi, I realised I was bisexual.<br><br>I was in love with my friend, and after three years of hiding and denying it, I was finally forced to face my truth. I couldn’t lie to myself anymore.<br><br>When I confessed how I felt and that I was bisexual, she didn’t respond.<br><br>Every time I would bring it up, she would just stay quiet. Her silence was an answer enough for me.<br><br>Heartbreakingly, she didn’t feel the same and it destroyed my friendship with someone I care about very much. But realising this truth about myself freed me.<br><br>I felt confident enough in my own body now to come out to another friend at the time. But when I did, she simply said: ‘But you don’t look it’.<br><br>I felt completely alienated<br><br>She repeated this phrase again and again, as if she couldn’t believe how deceptive my presence was.<br><br>‘Maybe it’s a phase?’ she eventually suggested, which broke my heart.<br><br>I tried to convince her that it wasn’t a phase, that this was who I am. But her words made me doubt myself.<br><br>After all, I didn’t look like your stereotypical bi-girly. I don’t have coloured hair, nor do I have any tattoos and I only have a single piercing in both my ears.<br><br>I believe her biphobia was more directed towards the fact that a straight-passing girl – who loves romance novels, fangirls over actor Justin Baldoni and loves to talk about love and friendship – is bisexual.<br><br>It felt like she wanted to erase that part of me and force me back into being the ‘straight’ friend she thought I was.<br><br>She constantly pushed me to date men and had fears about me trying to kiss her. Where we’d once shared a bed at sleepovers, now she said she felt unsafe sleeping with me.<br><br>As a result, I had to force excessive feminisation to be deemed as a good and safe friend.<br><br>I would pretend to be interested in fashion, boys and make-up. I even put lipstick on before I went to play badminton with her, which felt ridiculous. And I was constantly aware of physical boundaries, conscious of every touch, always fearing that anything could be misconstrued.<br><br>This ‘straight-passing’ judgement didn’t just come from heterosexual people though.<br><br>A queer acquaintance in England judged me for how ‘plain’ I looked and how I was not performing my queerness. And if you can believe it, she was actually much harsher than my straight friend.<br><br>For a start, she wouldn’t introduce me to any of her other queer friends. She’d make subtle digs in my direction at how being queer was meant to be performed with big bold colours and statement pieces.<br><br>I agree that that is one gorgeous way to be proud of your identity, it was just not my way.</p>

    <p>I felt completely alienated.<br><br>I was seemingly failing to be a proud bisexual woman in her eyes and yet somehow not straight enough for my heterosexual friends.<br><br>It made, and still makes me angry. I feel like it’s another uniform I fail to wear properly to fit into a community.<br><br>The thing is, being straight-passing can be a privilege as it can protect you in many situations from discrimination.<br><br>Being able to blend into the largely heteronormative world has allowed me to keep myself safe, and maintain social relationships with people from conservative backgrounds. My family, for instance, do not know I am gay and don’t doubt it either. Nor do my other friends to whom I have not come out to.<br><br>It has also allowed me to keep my options to pursue other opportunities open – especially in India. Working government jobs, or even in my own family business, would not be possible if there was even a hint of queerness in my presentation.<br><br>Platform is the home of Metro.co.uk&#x27;s first-person and opinion pieces, devoted to giving a platform to underheard and underrepresented voices in the media.<br><br>Find some of our best reads of the week below:<br><br>Paul Harris came close to taking his life three times.
