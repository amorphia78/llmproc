    <p>The protester who ambushed Keir Starmer at the Labour Conference is an Extinction Rebellion eco-zealot who describes himself as &#x27;a little bit of a weird one&#x27;.<br><br>Yaz Ashmawi, 28, was seen tipping glitter over Sir Keir just before he prepared to give the speech of his career to his supporters.<br><br>The black confetti looked to have alarmed the politician as Ashmawi yelled incoherently: &#x27;We demand a people&#x27;s house. We are in crisis, we are in crisis. Our whole future is in jeopardy&#x27;.<br><br>He was taken out of the conference hall to a Merseyside Police van and arrested.<br><br>JSO also shared footage of the stage-invasion linking it to their demand that Sir Keir &#x27;commits to revoking the oil and gas licences granted by this zombie Tory government&#x27;.<br><br>Ashmawi - who has his own website - describes himself as an Extinction Rebellion strategist and has acted as their spokesman.<br><br>He claims to be a physicist with a particular interest in the study of entropy.<br><br>Ashmawi, who is from Surrey, says on his website: &#x27;Sup, hi, hello, I&#x27;m a little bit of a weird one.<br><br>&#x27;I do a whole lot of different things.<br><br>&#x27;I work on physics a lot of the time, with particular interest in a quantity called entropy.<br><br>&#x27;I take photographs of many subjects: friends; strangers; small things; living things; places to see; spaces to pray.&#x27;<br><br>He certainly appears to be something of a globe-trotter, which may be at odds with his climate concerns.<br><br>One picture clearly shows him enjoying the incredible sights of Egypt.<br><br>The protester is also a talented photographer and posts examples of his work online.<br><br>He has taken part in climate change protests at COP26 and London.<br><br>Asked who inspired him, he said in an interview: &#x27;To answer this honestly I have to say that my faith is actually the source of hope, purpose and inspiration in my life.<br><br>&#x27;I think people can do brilliant and wonderful things, and yes work can be inspiring absolutely… but regarding individual people?<br><br>&#x27;I’m not sure I have someone in mind… maybe Greta Thunberg? For just being an all-out legend and speaking the truth.&#x27;</p>

    <p>In April 2003 he said as an XR spokesman: &#x27;We have changed.<br><br>&#x27;We&#x27;re not just blocking random junctions anymore, we&#x27;re coming to the centre of power.<br><br>&#x27;We are doing actions that do result in arrests but we&#x27;re targeting all those actions at the pillars in society that are most responsible and have the most power and influence to make a difference.<br><br>&#x27;There is a difference, we&#x27;re not going for the big, public mass disruption that we have in the past.&#x27;<br><br>He is keen on the UK pursuing a Net Zero strategy and has deep concerns about climate change.<br><br>In June this year he said on Twitter: &#x27;Only citizens&#x27; assemblies can get this done — our politicians don&#x27;t have a grip on the scale of change that&#x27;s needed.&#x27;<br><br>Extinction Rebellion this afternoon confirmed he was one of their activists, but said the stunt was not on behalf of them.<br><br>An XR spokesperson said: &#x27;We agree with Yaz that true democracy is citizen-led and that our politics needs an update.<br><br>&#x27;The greatest crisis we are facing is the climate and nature emergency and it is clear the political system is unable to cope with this.<br><br>&#x27;This is why XR is demanding a UK-wide, independently-run citizens&#x27; assembly on the climate and nature emergencies.&#x27;<br><br>A political splinter group with links to XR and Just Stop Oil, called People Demand Democracy, claimed responsibility for the incident, saying they are a &#x27;new group calling for an upgrade to the UK political system using civil disobedience&#x27;.<br><br>After being showered in glitter, Sir Keir was cheered as he took off his jacket and continued after the man was removed saying: &#x27;If he thinks that bothers me he doesn&#x27;t know me.&#x27;<br><br>He also joked that he was glad it hadn&#x27;t happened to his wife Victoria because her dress was &#x27;beautiful&#x27;.<br><br>The incident raises questions about the Labour leader&#x27;s personal protection and security at the conference on Merseyside.<br><br>Those at the event had already criticised how search points at the Exhibition Centre Liverpool has no security arches with rudimentary bag searches instead.</p>
