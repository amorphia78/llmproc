    <p>PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil activists cut into Stansted airport&#x27;s private airfield and sprayed orange paint on private jets using fire extinguishers, targeting planes where Taylor Swift&#x27;s aircraft are believed parked. The protesters, including 22-year-old Cole Macdonald from Brighton and Oxford student Ms Lynch, demand the UK government commit to ending fossil fuel extraction by 2030. Both were arrested by Essex police.<br><br>SECONDARY: The action occurred one day after JSO activists painted Stonehenge orange before the summer solstice, which was condemned by both Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer as vandalism.</p>
