    <p>PRIMARY: Extinction Rebellion co-founder Dr Gail Bradbrook received a 15-month suspended jail sentence for breaking a reinforced security glass window at the Department for Transport headquarters in October 2019, causing Â£27,660 in damage. She climbed onto an entrance canopy and used tools to break the glass during XR&#x27;s second major protest. Bradbrook claimed she had &quot;permission from nature&quot; and was trying to stop crimes against humanity.<br><br>SECONDARY: The primary protest occurred during XR&#x27;s broader second major protest that brought traffic chaos to parts of central London.</p>
