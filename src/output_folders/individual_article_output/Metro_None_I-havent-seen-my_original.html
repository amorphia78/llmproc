        <h1>I haven’t seen my kids in 11 years after my wife took them home with her</h1><p>Watching as my children played together, I smiled. Today was a perfect family outing.<br><br>I’d seen their faces light up at the sight of dinosaur bones at the Natural History Museum. Now they were having fun collecting twigs in Hyde Park.<br><br>There were no screens or phones. Just me and my kids having an idyllic day out.<br><br>I was sad. Because I knew that in just a few short weeks they’d be taken from me.<br><br>It all started in October 2011, when my then wife said ‘I want to go home.’<br><br>We had been together nearly 15 years and had three children, all under 13, but our bond was weakening.<br><br>A lot of it had to do with cultural differences – I’m British and she is from another country – so ‘going home’ would mean her living on the other side of the world, thousands of miles away.<br><br>And she wanted to take our children with her. I refused.<br><br>If my wife wanted a separation or divorce then fine, but I did not want my children to leave the UK.<br><br>They were safe here, they had two loving parents in their lives, they had everything they needed.<br><br>Frankly, I needed them.<br><br>I did everything I could to be, and like to think I was, a good father.<br><br>On weekends I made sure we went out to do something special like hit the coast or head to Legoland. ‘Sunday funday’, as we called it.<br><br>But my wife’s mind was made up and a short time later, I received a family court summons.<br><br>I fell to my knees and cried out as a sudden sense of loss slammed into me<br><br>My wife had filed a ‘leave to remove’ case – the means by which a parent seeks court permission to permanently move their children out of England or Wales, when the other parent does not agree to it.<br><br>Holding the paper in my hand I expected to feel angry or sad, but I didn’t.<br><br>To me it was just a symbol of the long battle to come.<br><br>Determined not to let my children go without a fight, I researched UK family law and learned that these cases were looked upon very favourably by the courts.<br><br>In fact, a University of Central London analysis showed that 82.4% of sampled leave to remove cases submitted by a married parent were approved.<br><br>I knew then that my case would be a difficult one. Even so, it still came as a surprise when, on the first day, the judge told me I should ‘prepare for the eventuality of losing’.<br><br>Sure enough, at the end of three days of hearings, the judge issued her order – my wife’s application to remove the children permanently from the UK had been approved.<br><br>One day I was a father living with three children in his life; the next I was alone in an empty house<br><br>What hurt even more though was what the judge wrote in her summary.<br><br>‘It is likely that the relationships between the father and the children will be extinguished.’<br><br>The cold clinicality of this term, ‘extinguished’, still hurts, but I was determined to make every second I had left with them count.<br><br>Taking them to the museum and the park in London was just one of our final adventures together.<br><br>We had so much fun and I was thankful that, though the children knew they would be leaving me soon, they were too young to truly understand what that meant.<br><br>My children’s last day in England came around far quicker than I liked.<br><br>After my breakfast, my wife arrived in a taxi.<br><br>‘It’s time to go’, she said to the children.<br><br>I followed them outside, and began my goodbyes. ‘I love you,’ I said as I hugged and kissed them one by one, and they echoed my sentiments.<br><br>Within 30 seconds they had disappeared from view and were gone.<br><br>I went back inside the house, and fell to my knees and cried out as a sudden sense of loss slammed into me.<br><br>One day I was a father living with three children in his life; the next I was alone in an empty house, and I knew things would never be the same again.</p>
