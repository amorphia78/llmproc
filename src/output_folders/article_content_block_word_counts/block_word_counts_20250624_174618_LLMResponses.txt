The Greenpeace apology should not be tagged as negative comments because apologies from protesters themselves don't count as criticism of the protest - they're acknowledging unintended consequences while still being from the protesters' perspective.

#GS #ES Six more Extinction Rebellion protesters who blockaded a newspaper printing works have been found guilty of obstructing the highway. #EE The blockade in September was at Newsprinters, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News UK, in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire.

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. I incorrectly tagged Judge Fudge's statement as negative comments (#NS #NE), but judges' statements during legal proceedings are not expressions of approval or disapproval of the protest - they are neutral judicial findings. The judge was making factual legal determinations about the impact of the protest, not criticizing it.

Climate change protesters from Extinction Rebellion are planning high-impact "deliberate disruption" during the upcoming COP26 summit in Glasgow. #GE The group, known for its "non-violent direct action," #MS aims to call on world leaders to take urgent action on the climate emergency. #ME #GS #MS Catherine Idle, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, stated, "Our approach is to have deliberate disruption where it's going to make the most impact." She emphasized that their goal is to get the attention of people in positions of power, not to inconvenience the general public. #ME #ES The activists say they are prepared to be arrested #EE but will try not to block routes used by emergency vehicles. The protesters' primary target appears to be the COP26 conference itself and the world leaders attending it. #GE #MS Idle explained, "There have been 25 COPs already and emissions are still rising and so we're there to demand they do better." #ME
#MS #PH #CS Catherine Idle from Extinction Rebellion says the aim is to have the most impact #CE #ME
While the exact number of protesters is not specified, the article mentions that as many as 100,000 people are expected to attend a march and rally organized by the COP26 Coalition on November 6th. Police Scotland is preparing for potential disruptions, with 10,000 officers on duty every day during the conference. #NS The force states it will facilitate peaceful protests but won't tolerate anything that disrupts the conference or the wider community. #NE Extra cell capacity has been arranged, and courts in several Scottish cities are preparing to deal with additional cases. It is impossible to predict how widespread or disorderly the protests will be or the impact they will have, just as it's impossible to predict how the conference will end.

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. The sentence "Police were accused of heavy-handed tactics after officers were seen using batons and dragging protesters from the top of a bus near London Bridge" should not be tagged as PERSONAL EFFECTS because it describes what police did to protesters, but it's framed as an accusation about police tactics rather than directly describing effects on the protesters themselves.

Content: #GS #PH #CS Toyota was ranked the 10th worst company in the world by InfluenceMap in 2022 #CE
Climate activists have hacked billboards as part of an international protest against car adverts.Billboards in Easton and St Werburghs in Bristol have been replaced with spoof adverts targeting car companies. #GE #MS The Brandalism group claimed the hacking and local activists are calling for Bristol City Council to cut air pollution by restricting car adverts. #ME Bristol City Council said it planned to tackle air pollution by investing £424m in low carbon energy projects instead.Several councils in the UK, including Cambridgeshire, Norwich and North Somerset, have introduced restrictions on advertising for environmentally-damaging products, such as fossil fuel companies, flights and SUV cars.Despite Bristol City Council banning advertising for unhealthy food, alcohol and gambling, it has yet to introduce similar restrictions on "high carbon" advertising.When asked whether they would consider advertising restrictions, Bristol City council said it planned to tackle emissions by insulating homes, installing district heating and improving transport, among other measures. #GS The action in the past few days has been organised by members of climate activist group Brandalism, which hacked into more than 400 commercial advertising billboards and bus stops across the UK, Belgium, France and Germany. #GE

Climate activists have hacked billboards as part of an international protest against car adverts.Billboards in Easton and St Werburghs in Bristol have been replaced with spoof adverts targeting car companies.The Brandalism group claimed the hacking and local activists are calling for Bristol City Council to cut air pollution by restricting car adverts. #GE Bristol City Council said it planned to tackle air pollution by investing £424m in low carbon energy projects instead.Several councils in the UK, including Cambridgeshire, Norwich and North Somerset, have introduced restrictions on advertising for environmentally-damaging products, such as fossil fuel companies, flights and SUV cars.Despite Bristol City Council banning advertising for unhealthy food, alcohol and gambling, it has yet to introduce similar restrictions on "high carbon" advertising.When asked whether they would consider advertising restrictions, Bristol City council said it planned to tackle emissions by insulating homes, installing district heating and improving transport, among other measures. #GS The action in the past few days has been organised by members of climate activist group Brandalism, which hacked into more than 400 commercial advertising billboards and bus stops across the UK, Belgium, France and Germany. #GE

Looking at my previous output, I can see several mistakes in my tagging:

1. In the title, I tagged criticism of the protester's hypocrisy as negative comments, but this doesn't qualify as criticism of "the protest or its effects" - it's criticism of the protester's personal circumstances.

2. I tagged the description of Norton's home as negative comments, but this is just factual reporting, not criticism of the protest.

3. I missed tagging "infuriated motorists" as general disruption effects.

4. I incorrectly tagged police response as negative comments - police operational response isn't criticism of the protest.

5. I tagged Roger Hallam being prepared for arrests as personal effects, but this is about planned future events, not effects of the current protest.

Left-wing activists have taken to Twitter to criticize the closure of Sydney Harbour Bridge this weekend for filming of Ryan Gosling's The Fall Guy. #NE #GS #ES The closure comes weeks after climate change protester Deanna 'Violet' Coco, 31, was sent to prison in December for eight months after she blocked a lane in April. #EE #GE #NS Twitter activists fumed at what they called a 'double standard' after Ms Coco was put behind bars for what a magistrate called 'selfish emotional' actions. One wrote, 'Filming a Ryan Gosling flick closes the Harbour Bridge. All good. But a woman delays traffic on same to protest fossil fuels and she's imprisoned. Got it.' #NE #GS The court was told Coco drove a large hire truck along the Cahill Expressway on the bridge to purposefully block a lane during peak hour on April 13, around 8.30am. While the truck was obstructing traffic, she stood on top of it, held a lit emergency flare and livestreamed the event. After 25 minutes, police arrived and forcibly removed the protesters from the iconic Sydney landmark, #ES with Coco resisting arrest. #EE #GE
#PH #CS  #CE
#GS Defence lawyer Mark Davis told the court a 'salient fact' in Coco's case was that she only blocked one lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge when there were five. 'One lane was blocked ... it was a deliberate decision to only block one lane,' Mr Davis said. 'To put it simply, the traffic may have still been moving, there was no suggestion there was backup of traffic.' #GE #ES Coco was convicted and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight months. Her legal counsel immediately filed an appeal. #EE Coco is a serial protester and a member of climate activist groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Fireproof Australia.

I incorrectly tagged the defense lawyer's comments as general disruption when they should be tagged as protester messaging, since the defense lawyer is acting as an ally of the protester. I also missed tagging the magistrate's criticism as negative comments.

Left-wing activists have taken to Twitter to criticize the closure of Sydney Harbour Bridge this weekend for filming of Ryan Gosling's The Fall Guy. #NE #GS #ES The closure comes weeks after climate change protester Deanna 'Violet' Coco, 31, was sent to prison in December for eight months after she blocked a lane in April. #EE #GE #NS Twitter activists fumed at what they called a 'double standard' #NS after Ms Coco was put behind bars for what a magistrate called 'selfish emotional' actions. #NE One wrote, 'Filming a Ryan Gosling flick closes the Harbour Bridge. All good. But a woman delays traffic on same to protest fossil fuels and she's imprisoned. Got it.' #NE #GS The court was told Coco drove a large hire truck along the Cahill Expressway on the bridge to purposefully block a lane during peak hour on April 13, around 8.30am. While the truck was obstructing traffic, she stood on top of it, held a lit emergency flare and livestreamed the event. After 25 minutes, police arrived and forcibly removed the protesters from the iconic Sydney landmark, #ES with Coco resisting arrest. #EE #GE
#PH #CS  #CE
#MS Defence lawyer Mark Davis told the court a 'salient fact' in Coco's case was that she only blocked one lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge when there were five. 'One lane was blocked ... it was a deliberate decision to only block one lane,' Mr Davis said. 'To put it simply, the traffic may have still been moving, there was no suggestion there was backup of traffic.' #ME #ES Coco was convicted and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight months. Her legal counsel immediately filed an appeal. #EE Coco is a serial protester and a member of climate activist groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Fireproof Australia.

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. The quote from Adam saying "This may seem disruptive, but it is chicken feed in comparison to climate change" should not be included in the messaging block, as it appears to be expressing approval/support for the protest rather than conveying the protesters' campaign message. Since Adam appears to be a protester himself, this would not qualify as a positive comments block either.

Looking at my previous output, I need to make corrections. I incorrectly tagged some content that doesn't meet the criteria:

1. Lineker's defense about climate change posing greater risk is his own argument/opinion, not approval of the protest itself
2. The general references to "condemnation" and "praise" are too vague to qualify as negative/positive comments according to the rules

Looking at my previous output, I can identify several mistakes in my tagging:

1. I incorrectly tagged some content as PROTESTER MESSAGING that was actually reported descriptions of the protest rather than direct quotes or messages from protesters
2. I incorrectly tagged some neutral reporting as POSITIVE COMMENTS
3. I missed some content that should have been tagged as GENERAL DISRUPTION

Content: #ES Six Extinction Rebellion activists have been cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell's London headquarters in 2019, despite the judge directing jurors that they had no defence in law. The protesters, including two of the group's co-founders, were acquitted after a trial at Southwark crown court. #EE #GS Prosecutor Diana Wilson told jurors that each of the defendants deliberately sprayed graffiti or smashed windows of the Shell building in Belvedere Road, central London, on 15 April 2019. The protest, which saw activists pour fake oil, glue themselves to windows and doors, break glass, climb on to a roof and spray graffiti, was part of wider Extinction Rebellion demonstrations across the capital. #GE Wilson said that while some protesters stood outside the building holding banners or speaking through megaphones, #GS "these defendants went further", adding: "The seven involved caused significant damage." #GE #MS All those who stood trial explained they had targeted the Shell building because the oil giant was directly contributing to the climate crisis, thereby causing serious injury and death, and argued that it was a "necessary" and "proportionate" response to the harm being caused. #ME

2. I tagged the defendants being "jubilant" as positive comments, but this describes the protesters' own reaction, not approval from others
3. I missed tagging some clear instances of general disruption effects

Here is the corrected version:

Title: Jury acquits Extinction Rebellion protesters despite 'no defence in law'
Content: #ES Six Extinction Rebellion activists have been cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell's London headquarters in 2019, despite the judge directing jurors that they had no defence in law. The protesters, including two of the group's co-founders, were acquitted after a trial at Southwark crown court. #EE #GS Prosecutor Diana Wilson told jurors that each of the defendants deliberately sprayed graffiti or smashed windows of the Shell building in Belvedere Road, central London, on 15 April 2019. The protest, which saw activists pour fake oil, glue themselves to windows and doors, break glass, climb on to a roof and spray graffiti, was part of wider Extinction Rebellion demonstrations across the capital. Wilson said that while some protesters stood outside the building holding banners or speaking through megaphones, "these defendants went further", adding: "The seven involved caused significant damage." #GE #MS All those who stood trial explained they had targeted the Shell building because the oil giant was directly contributing to the climate crisis, thereby causing serious injury and death, and argued that it was a "necessary" and "proportionate" response to the harm being caused. #ME

#ES Judge Gregory Perrins directed jurors that even if they thought the protesters were "morally justified", it did not provide them with a lawful excuse to commit criminal damage. However, the jury of seven women and five men took seven hours and four minutes to acquit them of both charges. The defendants, who represented themselves, were jubilant as they left court. #EE #MS One of the acquitted protesters, Simon Bramwell, said: "This is such a significant victory for the consciousness of the British people when it comes to the huge, immediate threat of climate change and the absolute failure of our government to do anything meaningful about it." #ME

Looking at my previous output, I found several mistakes:

1. I incorrectly tagged "The platform will enable Shell to further exploit the Penguins oil and gas field off the Shetland Islands, potentially unlocking eight new wells" as general disruption, when this is actually describing Shell's operations that are being disrupted, not the disruption effects themselves.

2. I incorrectly tagged Greenpeace's calculation about CO2 emissions as protester messaging, when this appears to be factual reporting by the journalist rather than a message the protesters are trying to convey.

Eastburn, who lives in a home worth almost £1 million near Clapham Common in south London, acknowledges her privileged position. She believes that as a white middle-aged woman, it's easier for her to navigate the criminal justice system.#MS The activist claims she is making these sacrifices for her children and for children everywhere. Eastburn was prompted to engage in non-violent direct action after a UN report on global warming in 2018. She likens her activism to that of the suffragettes and the US civil rights movement.

Despite her numerous arrests, Eastburn remains committed to her cause. She argues that change can only come about through civil disobedience and states, "I'm not proud of it. But I don't feel what I've done is criminal. I feel like I'm preventing a far greater crime." #ME

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. The picture and caption should be included in a messaging block since the caption specifically mentions that Eastburn "insists that her protests against climate change are 'proportionate'" which is protester messaging. Here is the corrected version:

Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. The title contains messaging from the protester (his quote about being willing to be the most hated man), but it also contains content that is not messaging - specifically "Just Stop Oil protester:" which is just identifying information, not part of the protester's message.

Here is the corrected version:
