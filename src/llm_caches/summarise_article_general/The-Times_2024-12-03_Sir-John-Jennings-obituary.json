His tenure was marked by regular disruption from environmental, human rights and anti-apartheid groups, forcing him to learn how to manage difficult situations.\n\nThe 1995 Brent Spar controversy proved particularly challenging. Shell was forced by Greenpeace to abandon plans for sinking a redundant oil storage buoy in the Atlantic, despite this being agreed as the most practical solution and the buoy having been cleaned years earlier. The U-turn followed months of hostile media coverage and condemnation from European governments, leaving Prime Minister John Major, who had supported Shell, looking foolish. Major was understood to be furious with Jennings's decision.\n\nSix months after the execution of author Ken Saro-Wiwa and nine other Ogoni activists protesting Shell's pollution of the Niger Delta, Jennings called for a minute's silence at Shell's 1996 annual meeting \"in the spirit of reconciliation.\" Outside, 200 demonstrators banged drums and demanded \"Get the Shell out of Nigeria.\"\n\nHowever, Jennings learned from these experiences, telling a petroleum conference that the oil industry needed to listen to the public and acknowledge their concerns, presenting their case \"with persuasive imagery in an acceptable and media-friendly manner.\" He recognized that \"cold facts alone are not enough.\"\n\nJennings made valuable contributions to Shell's environmental credentials, improving deep-water drilling techniques and biomass technologies for lower-carbon energy. He initiated global listening exercises, organizing 14 round-table conferences with over 300 people from 53 countries to understand society's changing expectations of multinationals, describing it as \"not a PR exercise but rather a transparent attempt to find out what people really want.\"\n\nBorn in Oldbury in 1937, Jennings studied geology at Birmingham University before joining Shell in 1961. He helped discover Oman's first oil reserves and rose through various international roles before becoming managing director in 1987 and chairman in 1993. He was knighted in 1997."
