Speaking to oil and gas leaders in Aberdeen, she criticized the planning system as having \"become a paradise for activists and a graveyard for investment.\"\n\nBadenoch accused Sir Keir Starmer of \"surrendering to the activists\" over the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields, promising that a Conservative government would introduce a presumption in favour of new fields and ensure \"no more judicial overreach.\" She described Labour's ban on new oil and gas licences as \"unilateral economic disarmament dressed up as virtue\" and warned that without investment, the UK would rely on imports for over 80% of oil and gas demand by 2030.\n\nHowever, a court ruled in January that consent for Rosebank and Jackdaw had been granted unlawfully, requiring fresh government approval. Lord Ericht determined that a more detailed environmental impact assessment was needed, considering the climate effects of burning extracted fossil fuels. The case was brought by environmental campaigners Uplift and Greenpeace, with Labour ministers choosing not to challenge the judicial review.\n\nBadenoch warned that 180 out of 280 fields would shut down within five years without urgent action, calling the situation \"collapse\" rather than \"managed transition.\"\n\nEnergy Minister Michael Shanks delivered a coded attack on Badenoch's announcements, arguing for rational, cooperative transition management rather than \"a few lines in a political press release.\"\n\nAmi McCarthy from Greenpeace UK countered that Badenoch was ignoring scientific and economic advice, noting that remaining North Sea reserves would last only \"a few months or years at current rates of consumption.\""
