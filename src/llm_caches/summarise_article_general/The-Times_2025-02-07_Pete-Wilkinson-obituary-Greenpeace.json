A working-class campaigner from Deptford, Wilkinson was recruited in 1977 by Greenpeace founder David McTaggart, who had asked for \"the most ornery sonofabitch\" from Friends of the Earth.\n\nAs campaign director for over a decade, Wilkinson proved a persistent thorn in Margaret Thatcher's side, organizing dramatic protests including sailing inflatables below British nuclear waste dumping rigs, chasing Japanese whalers, and scaling Big Ben in 1984. His meticulous planning generated maximum publicity - \"When we tell the press that we're going to do something, they know that it's going to be effective and they know it's going to be dramatic,\" he said.\n\nWilkinson's crowning achievement was helping prevent mineral exploitation in Antarctica. Leading six expeditions from 1985, he established the first year-round Antarctic protest base on Ross Island. His team \"lived on adrenaline and played hard\" during the volatile polar conditions. This persistent campaign contributed to the 1991 treaty designating Antarctica a \"World Park\" with a 50-year mining moratorium that still stands today.\n\nEarly victories included disrupting the 1978 International Whaling Commission conference and preventing a seal cull around Orkney Islands, which gained worldwide media attention and established Greenpeace as \"box office\" news. By the 1980s, they owned three ships and had 30,000 British supporters.\n\nWilkinson's activism was motivated by anger at environmental destruction: \"I don't like to see what is essentially a very unique and beautiful thing being polluted and destroyed.\" His relationship with police he dismissed as \"good-natured competition,\" claiming officers privately supported their cause.\n\nAfter leaving Greenpeace, funding challenges meant he worked at Asda and drove school buses while continuing evening campaigns, latterly fighting the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power station."
