The choirs aim to disrupt events by turning up uninvited to sing climate protest messages.\n\nFlanagan said the movement had \"hit a nerve\" with people who wanted to protest but didn't want to get arrested. She was inspired after watching Americans sing alternative lyrics to \"God Bless America\" at a conference, noting \"they walked out singing in harmony with such dignity that I thought 'that is the way to do it'.\"\n\nThe movement holds six large-scale protest actions annually. On 7 March, more than 150 singers protested the government's Rosebank oil field decision at the Palace of Westminster, performing a reworked Hallelujah Chorus in St Stephen's Hall.\n\nFlanagan explained: \"There are a lot of people who think there is something not quite right with nature... Not everyone wants to be a climate activist and I get that, some environmental activism can be quite alienating.\" She added: \"We try and change hearts and minds through singing rather than shouting.\"\n\nHowever, their Westminster action drew official response. A UK Parliament spokesperson confirmed that while the group had accessed legitimately, \"this activity was in contravention of the House's rules on access. The individuals were asked to leave and immediately did so.\"\n\nMember Jean Pollard, 69, joined because she likes singing but also wants to express climate concerns: \"I have been very concerned about the situation, and angry and disappointed with the government.\" She said she was singing for her grandchildren's future.\n\nDuncan Appleby, who established a Guildford choir, said the \"contradiction\" between beautiful singing and protest words made the message more powerful: \"It is so powerful, it's this art that we are bringing into these spaces.\"\n\nFlanagan concluded: \"There is something about singing that can reach people in a way that if you're just shouting it doesn't have the same impact.\""
