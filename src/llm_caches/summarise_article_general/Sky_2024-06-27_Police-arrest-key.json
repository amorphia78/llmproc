  "string_data": "Six people were arrested at a Just Stop Oil meeting in east London on Thursday evening, with Metropolitan Police claiming some were \"key organisers\" of the climate protest group. The arrests were made under new Public Order Act provisions that make it illegal to conspire to disrupt national infrastructure projects.\n\nThe Met Police stated: \"We know Just Stop Oil plan to disrupt airports and thousands of holidaymakers this summer,\" and emphasized that \"activists do not have the right to commit criminal acts that may also endanger themselves and others.\" The force said anyone disrupting airport safety and security \"can expect to be dealt with swiftly and robustly,\" adding they continue working with airport operators to prevent significant disruption.\n\nHowever, Just Stop Oil disputed the police characterization, claiming officers had \"raided a soup night.\" Video footage posted by the group showed the arrests, including a woman telling officers \"I've come here for soup\" as she was detained. The group also said another person was arrested while staying with their parents.\n\nDuring the arrests, one officer told a handcuffed man: \"By taking part in the organisation of this event this evening, I suspect that you are taking part to plot to cause serious disruption to UK airports.\"\n\nThe arrests follow recent Just Stop Oil actions, including last week's incident at Stansted Airport where two women were charged with criminal damage after spraying private jets with orange paint, allegedly causing over £5,000 in damage. Essex Police confirmed they responded to the incident in the airport's private area, though Taylor Swift's jet, which Just Stop Oil mentioned had landed \"mere hours before,\" was not present during the protest."
