After world heritage site Stonehenge is vandalised by Just Stop Oil, #NE Rishi Sunak challenges major Labour donor who backed extremist group\nContent: #DS #PH #CS Just Stop Oil activists use fire extinguishers to spray orange powder paint on Stonehenge (Alt: The image shows Stonehenge's ancient stone circle being sprayed with bright orange powder from fire extinguishers by protesters. Several people are visible around the monument, with thick orange clouds of powder paint billowing around the iconic megalithic stones. The historic site's distinctive trilithons are clearly visible through the orange haze on the green grass landscape.) #CE\n#NS Eco-fanatics caused outrage #NE yesterday by defacing Stonehenge on the eve of the summer solstice.Just Stop Oil activists used fire extinguishers to spray orange powder paint on at least three of the ancient stones before calmly sitting down cross-legged in front of the world-famous site. #DE #NS Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer showed a rare united front in their condemnation of the stunt, #NE which raised new questions about the historically intimate relationship between the Labour Party and Just Stop Oil. #NS The Prime Minister described it as a 'disgraceful act of vandalism', while the Labour leader branded the group 'pathetic'. #NE #NS Yet Labour was accused of 'faux outrage' #NE after #MS JSO boasted of planning its action 'days after the Labour Party recommitted to halting all future oil and gas licences' – a policy the activists claim was influenced by their extremist road-blocking tactics. #ME #NS Mr Sunak rounded on major Labour backer Dale Vince, who, until last year, bankrolled the environmental protest movement. He said: 'This is a disgraceful act of vandalism. Just Stop Oil should be ashamed of their activists and they and anyone associated with them, including a certain Labour party donor, should issue a condemnation of this shameful act immediately.' #NE\n#PH #CS Prime Minister Rishi Sunak described it as a 'disgraceful act of vandalism' (Alt: The image shows a man wearing safety equipment including a white hard hat with ) #CE\nLabour has accepted more than £5 million from Mr Vince, including £1 million after the election was called. The green energy tycoon supported JSO from its foundation and donated at least £340,000 before cutting off the cash last October. #DS Police arrested two protesters – named by the group as Rajan Naidu, 73, from Birmingham, and Oxford student Niamh Lynch, 21 – on 'suspicion of damaging the ancient monument'. #DE #MS Lynch said: 'Stonehenge at solstice is all about celebrating the natural world – but look at the state it's in! Standing inert for generations works well for stones – not climate policy.' Naidu, who is understood to be a Quaker, added: 'Either we end the fossil-fuel era, or the fossil-fuel era will end us.' Just Stop Oil said: 'Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything.' #ME\n#PH #CS Major Labour backer Dale Vince (pictured), who, until last year, bankrolled the environmental protest movement (Alt: The image shows a man with short brown hair wearing a black zip-up jacket or hoodie with a logo on the chest. He has his arms crossed and is wearing distinctive patterned gloves or mittens with what appears to be a skull or face design. Around his neck is a patterned scarf or neck warmer. He's smiling at the camera, and there's a yellow background behind him.) #CE"
