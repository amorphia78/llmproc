The police must work within a legal framework to secure evidence for the offence of highway obstruction, which includes proving the obstruction is deliberate, unlawful, and unreasonable in the context of protest. #GS On Saturday, Just Stop Oil campaigners sat in Charing Cross Road, Kensington High Street, Harleyford Street and Blackfriars Road, #MS demanding the government halts new oil licences. #ME This prompted some drivers to leave their vehicles in Harleyford Street to remove demonstrators, who persistently returned to retake their places in the road. #GE\n#GS #PH #CS Some members of the public took matters into their own hands in London on Saturday #CE #GE\n#NS One frustrated motorist said: \"We've asked you nicely, you are doing the wrong thing by blocking innocent people going about their business. Can you please move before we pick you up and move you?\" #NE #GS #ES The police later reported that 33 protesters were arrested and the roads were reopened. #EE #GE #MS The group wants the government to halt all new oil and gas licences and consents. #ME\nMr Twist stated that the Met is \"absolutely committed to providing a quick and effective response to activists who have been significantly and deliberately disrupting people's daily lives.\" #GS #ES He revealed that the force had arrested 651 people since the beginning of October in relation to these protests. #EE #GE\n#ES #PH #CS The Met said it has arrested more than 700 Just Stop Oil demonstrators since the start of October #CE #EE"
