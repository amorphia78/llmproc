Decker, who is German, was served a deportation order by the Home Office while in prison. #DE #PS In their letter, the actors say: \"We believe that punishing him [Decker] with deportation in addition to the 14 months he has already spent in prison is out of proportion to the crime committed and unconducive to the public good.\" #PE\n#PH #CS A protester holds aloft a poster featuring Marcus Decker during a demonstration outside the Royal Courts of Justice last July. (Alt: A protester holds a large poster featuring a bearded man named Marcus wearing a purple knit hat.

The letter says: \"We urge you to consider what it would look like to the rest of the world if the UK, which prides itself in leading on climate action, were to start deporting human rights defenders like Marcus.\" #PE #MS Decker's partner, Holly Cullen-Davies, a musician, said: \"What I would say to the government, though, is you cannot deport dissent and you cannot deport the climate crisis.\" #ME #DS Decker is unlikely to be deported immediately on his release as he has filed a legal challenge to the order. #DE"
