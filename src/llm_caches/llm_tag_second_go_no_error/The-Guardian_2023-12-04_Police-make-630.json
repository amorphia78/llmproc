  "string_data": "Looking at my previous output, I need to make one correction. The phrase \"Liberty condemns 'staggering and shocking' statistic as anti-protest legislation is enacted\" should not be tagged as negative comments because it's not criticism of the protest, protesters, or the protest's effects - it's criticism of the legislation and arrest statistics.\n\nHere is the corrected output:\n\nID: The-Guardian_2023-12-04_Police-make-630\nSource: The-Guardian\nTitle: #DS Police make 630 arrests of climate protesters in London in one month #DE\nContent: Liberty condemns 'staggering and shocking' statistic as anti-protest legislation is enacted #DS Police have made at least 630 arrests of peaceful protesters campaigning against new oil and gas production in the past month, as the authorities exploit new powers under the government's anti-protest legislation.\n\nThe mass arrests of more than 470 people – some individuals were arrested more than once – was condemned by civil rights group Liberty as \"staggering and shocking\".\n\nThe protests involve slow marching along roads and are a form of peaceful civil resistance, says Just Stop Oil. #DE #MS The protests over the past four weeks coincided with the British government confirming in the king's speech its plans to grant new North Sea oil and gas licences every year. #ME\n\n#DS Police are using new powers to make the mass arrests under section 7 of the Conservative government's Public Order Act 2023, which bans any action that \"interferes with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure\". According to data gathered by Just Stop Oil, almost half of the arrests were carried out under section 7. The offence carries a prison sentence of up to 12 months.\n\n#PH #CS Just Stop Oil protesters demonstrate outside New Scotland Yard in London on Saturday (Alt: The image shows climate protesters holding a large orange banner reading ) #CE\n\nEvidence reveals some people have been held in police custody for long periods after arrest. A 23-year-old was arrested within five minutes of joining a demonstration and held for 56 hours in custody. A 19-year-old student was held for three nights in a London prison despite being given bail by a magistrates court. Another 19-year-old student was held for 50 hours in a London police cell. #DE\n\n#NS Jun Pang, a policy and campaigns officer for Liberty, said: \"The staggering number of people arrested in recent weeks shows just how sweeping and dangerous these powers are. It's shocking to see hundreds of young protesters criminalised simply for standing up for what they believe in.\" #NE\n\n#MS Just Stop Oil said: \"They're imprisoning peaceful protesters, protecting the real criminals, and licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects while everything burns.\" #ME"
