The dangerous stunt occurred shortly after the race had been red-flagged due to a crash, meaning no cars were running at the time. Marshals and security swiftly removed the small group of protestors. #GE The incident has sparked debate, with former England footballer Gary Lineker expressing support for the protestors on Twitter, stating: #PS \"If it's not already too late, history will look back very favourably on these people.\" #PE However, former Formula 1 driver and Sky Sports pundit Martin Brundle strongly disagreed, responding: #NS \"Gary please don't encourage this reckless behaviour. They'd have been sliced into 100 pieces and fans, marshals and drivers were wholly at risk of injury and death.\" #NE\n#GS #PH #CS Protestors sat on the Silverstone track after Zhou's opening lap crash (Photo: REX) #CE #GE\nLineker, who has long spoken out on environmental issues, defended his stance, arguing that climate change poses a greater risk of death than delaying a motor race.
