  "string_data": "Looking at my previous output, I can identify several mistakes in my tagging:\n\n1. I incorrectly tagged the unfurling of the \"giant Just Stop Oil banner\" as messaging when it should be disruption effects\n2. I missed tagging some negative comments from judges\n3. I didn't properly tag all disruption effects consistently\n\nHere is the corrected version:\n\nID: BBC_2023-10-12_Just-Stop-Oil-protesters\nSource: BBC\nTitle: #DS Just Stop Oil protesters bid to challenge jail terms refused #DE\nContent: #DS #PH #CS (l-r) Marcus Decker and Morgan Trowland were found guilty of causing a public nuisance following the week-long trial at Basildon Crown Court in April (Alt: The image shows two men in side-by-side photos, both wearing winter clothing and appearing to be at height.

The right photo shows another bearded man wearing a blue hood over an orange high-visibility vest, with an aerial view of roads and buildings visible in the background.) #CE\n\nTwo Just Stop Oil protesters who scaled the Dartford Crossing bridge have been refused permission to challenge their jail sentences at the Supreme Court.Morgan Trowland, 40, was jailed for three years and Marcus Decker, 34, for two years for causing a public nuisance. The pair caused gridlock traffic after they scaled the bridge for almost 40 hours last October.A hearing in London decided their jail terms were \"not excessive\". Protesters appealed against the longevity of the sentences in July, but judges refused to grant permission for the two men to take their case to the UK's highest court. #DE #NS In their July ruling, the judges acknowledged the \"long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience on conscientious grounds\" and that the sentences handed to Trowland and Decker went \"well beyond previous sentences imposed for this type of offending\".\n\nBut at a hearing on Thursday, Lady Chief Justice Lady Carr said the jail terms were \"not excessive\" and the sentences met a \"legitimate\" aim of deterring others from such offending. Lady Carr added: \"The sentences should not be seen as having a 'chilling effect' on the right to peaceful protest or to assembly more generally - deterrence and 'chilling effect' are not the same.\" #NE\n#PH #CS (l-r) Marcus Decker and Morgan Trowland were told they would spend half of their sentences in prison (Alt: Two mugshot-style photographs show men against plain backgrounds. The left image shows a man with long dark hair and beard wearing a green hoodie over a pink shirt with cartoon graphics. The right image shows a bald man with a beard wearing dark clothing.) #CE\n\nHowever, Daniel Friedman KC, representing the activists, had previously argued their jail terms were \"the longest ever handed down in a case of non-violent protest in this country in modern times\". #DS Structural engineer Trowland, of Islington, north London, and private tutor Decker, of no fixed address, denied causing a public nuisance, arguing it was a protest. The trial heard the protesters ascended to a point close to 200ft above the road and unfurled a \"giant Just Stop Oil banner\" and \"rigged up hammocks\".\n\nEssex Police said those affected by the disruption included a \"heavily pregnant woman who needed urgent medical help\". Another person missed the funeral of their best friend of 35 years, and a business lost more than £160,000 in earnings. #DE\n#DS #PH #CS The activists were on the bridge for about 37 hours (Alt: This body camera footage shows a person in a red high-visibility jacket positioned on what appears to be a large bridge structure.
