  "string_data": "Looking at my previous output, I can identify several mistakes in my tagging:\n\n1. I incorrectly tagged the march/rally information as general disruption when it's described as a peaceful march, not disruptive protest\n2. I tagged police preparation as general disruption, but this is just preparation, not actual disruption effects\n3. I tagged court preparation as personal effects, but these are just preparations, not actual effects on protesters\n4. I missed tagging some messaging content properly\n\nHere is the corrected output:\n\nID: BBC_2021-10-28_COP26-protesters-planning\nSource: BBC\nTitle: #GS COP26 protesters planning high-impact disruption #GE\nContent: #GS #PH #CS Extinction Rebellion said it is planning further protests during COP26 #CE\nClimate change protesters from Extinction Rebellion are planning high-impact \"deliberate disruption\" during the upcoming COP26 summit in Glasgow. #GE The group, known for its \"non-violent direct action,\" #MS aims to call on world leaders to take urgent action on the climate emergency. #ME #GS #MS Catherine Idle, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, stated, \"Our approach is to have deliberate disruption where it's going to make the most impact.\" She emphasized that their goal is to get the attention of people in positions of power, not to inconvenience the general public. #ME #ES The activists say they are prepared to be arrested #EE but will try not to block routes used by emergency vehicles. The protesters' primary target appears to be the COP26 conference itself and the world leaders attending it. #GE #MS Idle explained, \"There have been 25 COPs already and emissions are still rising and so we're there to demand they do better.\" #ME\n#MS #PH #CS Catherine Idle from Extinction Rebellion says the aim is to have the most impact #CE #ME\nWhile the exact number of protesters is not specified, the article mentions that as many as 100,000 people are expected to attend a march and rally organized by the COP26 Coalition on November 6th. Police Scotland is preparing for potential disruptions, with 10,000 officers on duty every day during the conference. #NS The force states it will facilitate peaceful protests but won't tolerate anything that disrupts the conference or the wider community. #NE Extra cell capacity has been arranged, and courts in several Scottish cities are preparing to deal with additional cases. It is impossible to predict how widespread or disorderly the protests will be or the impact they will have, just as it's impossible to predict how the conference will end.\n#MS #PH #CS Greenpeace's Rebecca Newsom says they want to put pressure on world leaders #CE #ME"
