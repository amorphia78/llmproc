  "string_data": "Looking at my previous output, I need to make one correction. In the section where Michael Grant speaks outside court, I incorrectly tagged his statement \"Justice and common sense prevailed in court today. Peaceful protest is a vital part of our democracy.\" as positive comments about the protest. However, according to the rules, positive comments must be \"expressed by anyone except the protesters themselves,\" and Michael Grant is one of the defendants/protesters. Therefore, this should not be tagged as positive comments.\n\nHere is the corrected output:\n\nID: Sky_2024-09-20_Judge-throws-out\nSource: Sky\nTitle: Judge throws out charges against Greenpeace activists who scaled Sunak's home\nSubtitle: Prosecutors said the former prime minister faced a bill of just under £3,000 for repairs to broken roof tiles.

Prosecutors at York Magistrates' Court said Mr Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty were left with a bill of just under £3,000 for repairs. #DE But District Judge Adrian Lower concluded the evidence against the defendants was \"so tenuous\" that no court would convict them. Defence lawyer Owen Greenhall argued it could not be proved the roof damage was caused during the protest, telling the court: \"It's clear this is a roof where there is pre-existing damage in areas where the protesters did not go\".\n#DS #PH #CS Protestors covered the house in black fabric.
