Hallam was sentenced to five years' imprisonment while the remaining four defendants were each handed four years' imprisonment (Alt: Five people stand together with arms around each other's shoulders, smiling at the camera in front of a stone building with diamond-paned windows. From left to right: a woman in a patterned dark top, a woman in a light blue checkered shirt, an older woman with gray hair in dark clothing, a man in a dark sweater, and an older man with a gray beard wearing a red plaid shirt.) #CE\nMore than 1,000 prominent lawyers, academics and celebrities have demanded a meeting with the attorney general over the 'injustice' of handing five eco-activists with record sentences.#DS The Just Stop Oil protestors, including co-founder Roger Hallam, were jailed for a combined 21 years over a stunt that disrupted London's M25 motorway for four days in 2022.Prosecutors said the protests, which involved a total 45 activists, caused an economic hit of at least £765,000 and cost the Metropolitan Police more than £1.1million. The mob also caused a staggering 50,000 hours of vehicle delays affecting more than 700,000 vehicles, it was claimed, and left the M25 'compromised' for more than 120 hours.Hallam, 58, received a five-year prison term for organising the stunt, while Daniel Shaw, 38, Lucia Whittaker de Abreu, 35, Louise Lancaster, 58, and Cressida Gethin, 22, were each sentenced to four years for conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.#DE\n#PH #CS TV naturalist Chris Packham has written an open letter calling for a meeting with Attorney General Richard Hermer KC. Mr Packham described the sentences as a 'grotesque miscarriage of justice' (Alt: The image shows a man with glasses and graying hair speaking into a microphone at what appears to be an outdoor gathering or protest. He's wearing a yellow and gray vest or jacket. Behind him are trees and a building, with other people visible in the background, including someone holding papers. The setting appears to be a public demonstration or speaking event.) #CE\n#DS These sentences, handed down by Judge Christopher Hehir at Southwark Crown Court, surpass those given to JSO members who climbed the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge in October 2022.#DE#PS The United Nations human rights commissioner labelled the sentences as 'deeply troubling' and 'disproportionate'. TV naturalist Chris Packham described the sentences as a 'grotesque miscarriage of justice'.The letter argued that the activists were not allowed to explain their actions to a jury, undermining their right to a fair trial. The activists, it claims, were performing a vital service by raising awareness of the climate crisis.#PE#NS Judge Hehir blasted the 'fanatic' eco-activists when sentencing, saying: 'You have appointed yourselves as the sole arbiters of what should be done about climate change, bound neither by the principles of democracy nor the rule of law. Your fanaticism has made you heedless of the rights of your fellow citizens.'#NE\n#PH #CS Dale Vince, the millionaire Labour donor, wrote the letter alongside Packham which has been backed by Coldplay's Chris Martin (Alt: The image shows a performer on stage holding a microphone and raising one arm, wearing a colorful shirt with various patches or badges.
