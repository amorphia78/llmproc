I included the protesters' demand for \"an end to all subsidies for the use of fossil fuels\" in a messaging block, but this is reported information about what they are demanding rather than a direct quote or banner message from the protesters themselves. According to the rules, protester messaging should be quotes from protesters or reported summaries of things protesters said, and this appears to be more of a journalistic description of their campaign goal.\n\nHere is the corrected version:\n\nID: The-Guardian_2024-04-06_Greta-Thunberg-detained\nSource: The-Guardian\nTitle: #DS Greta Thunberg detained at The Hague climate demonstration #DE\nContent: #DS Climate activist Greta Thunberg was detained by police at a demonstration in The Hague, Netherlands, after joining protesters who tried to block a major highway into the city on Saturday.The 21-year-old climate activist was put in a bus by local police along with other protesters who attempted to block the A12 highway.
