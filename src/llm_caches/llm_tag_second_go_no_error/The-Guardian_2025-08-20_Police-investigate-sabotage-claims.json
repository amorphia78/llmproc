  "string_data": "Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. The police superintendent's quote should be tagged as a negative comment since it describes the activists' actions as \"criminal damage\" and \"criminal activity,\" which represents criticism of the protest actions.\n\nHere is the corrected version:\n\nID: The-Guardian_2025-08-20_Police-investigate-sabotage-claims\nSource: The-Guardian\nTitle: Police investigate sabotage claims by UK activists against 'fossil fuel finance'\nContent: #DS #PH #CS An activist with glue claimed to be at JP Morgan Chase offices in London. (Alt: The image shows hands applying what appears to be glue from a white bottle with an orange label to a glass surface or window. One hand is pressing against the glass while the other holds the glue bottle. The scene appears to be taking place indoors with dark surfaces visible in the background.) #CE\nThe City of London police are investigating claims by environmental activists to have carried out acts of sabotage on the offices of major insurers and financial institutions.Activist group Shut the System said its supporters had cut cables and glued electrical service cabinets at JP Morgan Chase and Allianz, in what it described as the start of \"a period of sustained sabotage\" against fossil fuel finance. The group also claimed to have targeted the Northampton HQ of Barclaycard, saying its activists had cut the 5G cable to the communications mast serving the building.Shut the System distributed photographs purporting to show its supporters carrying out the actions. Northampton police said they had not received any report of vandalism. #DE\n\n#NS Supt Jo Cash of the City of London police, said: \"We are aware of a social media post by Shut the System, which alleges that criminal damage has been caused to infrastructure in the City of London. We have had no reports of any criminal activity at this time, but we're speaking to those companies mentioned in the post and the wider business community. Inquiries are ongoing.\" #NE\n#DS #PH #CS Shut the System activists claimed to be at the Barclays HQ in Northampton. (Alt: Two people wearing bright orange high-visibility safety vests are crouched down working on or examining gray utility equipment/cabinets. One person appears to be a child or smaller individual. The scene is outdoors with autumn trees visible in the background and a white cylindrical column nearby.) #CE #DE\n\n#MS Shut the System said it targeted JP Morgan because it was \"ranked the world's largest banking investor in fossil fuels\", while Barclays was targeted because it was Europe's largest. Allianz was targeted because it is the sixth biggest insurer of fossil fuel projects and also insures Elbit Systems, the Israeli arms company.A Shut the System spokesperson said: \"I am enraged by the financial sector's continued support for deadly industries. It is unhinged, psychopathic greed at the expense of billions of people.\"The group is calling for financial institutions to stop all finance and insurance for fossil fuel expansion immediately and adopt 1.5C-aligned emissions-reduction targets. If the financial sector ignores their demands, then by October they will escalate further, the group said. #ME"
