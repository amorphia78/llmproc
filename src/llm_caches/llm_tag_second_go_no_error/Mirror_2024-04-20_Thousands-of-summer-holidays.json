  "string_data": "Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. I included \"Just Stop Oil was founded in 2022 to try to halt all new oil, gas and coal licences in the UK\" in a messaging block, but this is not a quote from protesters or a reported summary of what protesters said - it's factual background information provided by the journalist.\n\nHere is the corrected version:\n\nID: Mirror_2024-04-20_Thousands-of-summer-holidays\nSource: Mirror\nTitle: #DS Thousands of summer holidays at risk as Just Stop Oil plot to cause havoc at airports #DE\nContent: #PH #CS Just Stop Oil climate activist Phoebe Plummer was detained by police officers at a protest last year (Alt: The image shows police officers in high-visibility yellow jackets detaining a young woman with pink hair who is wearing an orange high-visibility vest. Multiple Metropolitan Police officers are present, with one officer placing his hand on the woman. The scene appears to be taking place on a street with buildings visible in the background.) #CE\n#DS Just Stop Oil activists are plotting to cause summer misery for thousands of holidaymakers. The environmental group plans to wreak havoc at airports here and across Europe from mid-June.Protesters will halt flights by storming terminal buildings, glueing themselves to runways and clambering onto jets in tourist hotspots like Spain, Greece and Turkey. It means travellers will likely face agonising delays here – while those lucky enough to take off could be forced to wait hours on the runway on the other side. #DE #NS Last night, MPs and travel experts accused the group of \"shooting itself in the foot\" by causing misery and risking lives. #NE #DS The plot was learned at a meeting attended by some 50 hardcore activists. #DE #MS Just Stop Oil's so-called poster girl, Phoebe Plummer, was greeted by roars as she announced \"disruption on a scale that has never been seen before\".She added: \"The most exciting part of this plan is that [it's] going to be part of an international effort. Flights operate on such a tight schedule to control air traffic that with action being caused in cities all around the world we're talking about radical, unignorable disruption.\" #ME\n#DS #PH #CS Busy terminals like Gatwick Airport face demos and delays this summer (Alt: The image shows an airport scene with a commercial aircraft approaching for landing above the runway. On the ground, several aircraft with British Airways livery are parked at the terminal. The airport appears to be Gatwick, with runways, terminal buildings, and surrounding residential areas visible. The overcast sky and bare trees suggest cooler weather conditions.) #CE #DE\nPrivately educated Plummer, who grew up in London's posh Chelsea, has been arrested for a string of disturbances. The pink-haired 22-year-old spent time in prison last year. #MS Plummer's shouty speech continued: \"It's time to wake up and get real – no summer holiday is more important than food security, housing and the lives of your loved ones. Flying is also a symbol of the gross wealth inequality that's plaguing our society and if we want to create change we need to adopt a more radical demand.\" #ME #NS Gary Johnson, Tory MP for Dartford, branded the strategy \"dangerous\" and \"selfish\", adding: \"The actions of Just Stop Oil are counterproductive and put people off their cause. Most people want to see the environment protected but militant, highly disruptive protests just anger those who are often just trying to enjoy a family holiday.\" #NE Just Stop Oil was founded in 2022 to try to halt all new oil, gas and coal licences in the UK.\n#DS #PH #CS Holiday favourites like Tenerife are being targeted by the group to ensure maximum disruption (Alt: This aerial view shows a curved sandy beach with turquoise waters, protected by a stone breakwater. Palm trees line the shore, with a coastal road running parallel to the beach. Mountains rise in the background, and several ships are visible in the blue ocean waters offshore.) #CE #DE"
