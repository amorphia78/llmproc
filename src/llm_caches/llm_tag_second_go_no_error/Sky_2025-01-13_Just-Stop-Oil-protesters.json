  "string_data": "Looking at my previous output, I can see I made a mistake. In the subtitle, I tagged \"The figure refers to the goal, set by the Paris Climate Agreement, of making sure global temperatures rise to no more than 1.5C higher than their pre-industrial level\" as protester messaging. However, this is explanatory text from the news article explaining what \"1.5\" refers to, not a message from the protesters themselves. This should not be tagged as protester messaging.\n\nHere is the corrected output:\n\nID: Sky_2025-01-13_Just-Stop-Oil-protesters\nSource: Sky\nTitle: #DS Just Stop Oil protesters spray-paint '1.5 is dead' on Charles Darwin's grave #DE\nSubtitle: The figure refers to the goal, set by the Paris Climate Agreement, of making sure global temperatures rise to no more than 1.5C higher than their pre-industrial level.\nContent: #DS #PH #CS  (Alt: Two protesters wearing ) #CE\nJust Stop Oil (JSO) protesters have spray-painted Charles Darwin's grave in Westminster Abbey to highlight rising global temperatures, the climate protest group has said.The slogan \"1.5 is dead\" was sprayed in chalk paint on the gravestone of the 19th-century naturalist - widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology - at about 9.30am on Monday. #DE The figure refers to the goal, set by the Paris Climate Agreement, of making sure global temperatures rise to no more than 1.5C higher than their pre-industrial level. Last year was the first time global temperatures passed the threshold of 1.5C above their pre-industrial level. Staying below that mark was one of the key commitments of the global Paris Climate Treaty which countries agreed to in 2015, in a bid to avert the most dangerous impacts of climate change. #DS JSO said Alyson Lee, 66, a retired teaching assistant from Derby, and Di Bligh, a 77-year-old former chief executive of Reading Council, from Rode, were involved in the protest.The Metropolitan Police confirmed two women were arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage \"with what is believed to be powdered paint at Westminster Abbey\". Officers led two women away from the abbey after the protest.\n#PH #CS JSO protesters Di Bligh, and Alyson Lee speak to a police officer outside Westminster Abbey.

We have passed the 1.5 degree threshold that was supposed to keep us safe. The government's plans will take us to over three degrees of warming. World leaders must stop burning oil, gas and coal by 2030.\" #ME #DS A spokesperson for the church confirmed orange paint had been sprayed onto the gravestone, but they do not think there will be any permanent damage. #DE\n#PH #CS A photograph of Charles Darwin made shortly before his death.

The image appears to be a historical portrait photograph with grainy quality typical of early photography, set against a dark background.) #CE"
