Pictured: Ryan Gosling filming on the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday #CE\nLeft-wing activists have taken to Twitter to criticize the closure of Sydney Harbour Bridge this weekend for filming of Ryan Gosling's The Fall Guy. #NE #GS #ES The closure comes weeks after climate change protester Deanna 'Violet' Coco, 31, was sent to prison in December for eight months after she blocked a lane in April. #EE #GE #NS Twitter activists fumed at what they called a 'double standard' #NS after Ms Coco was put behind bars for what a magistrate called 'selfish emotional' actions. #NE One wrote, 'Filming a Ryan Gosling flick closes the Harbour Bridge. All good. But a woman delays traffic on same to protest fossil fuels and she's imprisoned. Got it.' #NE #GS The court was told Coco drove a large hire truck along the Cahill Expressway on the bridge to purposefully block a lane during peak hour on April 13, around 8.30am. While the truck was obstructing traffic, she stood on top of it, held a lit emergency flare and livestreamed the event. After 25 minutes, police arrived and forcibly removed the protesters from the iconic Sydney landmark, #ES with Coco resisting arrest. #EE #GE\n#PH #CS  #CE\n#MS Defence lawyer Mark Davis told the court a 'salient fact' in Coco's case was that she only blocked one lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge when there were five. 'One lane was blocked ... it was a deliberate decision to only block one lane,' Mr Davis said. 'To put it simply, the traffic may have still been moving, there was no suggestion there was backup of traffic.' #ME #ES Coco was convicted and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight months. Her legal counsel immediately filed an appeal. #EE Coco is a serial protester and a member of climate activist groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Fireproof Australia.\n#PH #CS  #CE"
