The Munich public prosecutor's investigation and the Federal government considering new laws are both knock-on effects/consequences of the disruptive protests, which qualify as disruption effects according to the rules.\n\nHere is the corrected version:\n\nID: Telegraph_2024-09-29_Activists-throw-soup-on\nSource: Telegraph\nTitle: #DS Activists throw soup on British embassy in Berlin over Just Stop Oil sentences #DE\nSubtitle: #DS Three women from direct-action group Last Generation stage protest #DE in show of 'solidarity' with Van Gogh vandalisers\nContent: #DS Protesters have thrown tomato soup over the walls of the British embassy in Berlin #DE in protest over sentences given to Just Stop Oil protesters who did the same to Van Gogh's Sunflowers. #DS Three women from Last Generation, a controversial direct-action group, vandalised the embassy walls before holding up signs featuring photographs of Just Stop Oil activists Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland. #DE A court on Friday sentenced Plummer and Holland to two years and 20 months in prison respectively for throwing tomato soup on Vincent Van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" at the National Gallery in 2022. #MS Last Generation called Plummer and Holland \"climate prisoners\" and accused British authorities of \"endangering democracy\" through a \"politically-motivated\" verdict designed to \"criminalise climate activists\". #ME #DS There were similar protests at the British missions in Amsterdam, Paris and Rome. #DE Last Generation has gained notoriety in Germany for stunts inspired by Just Stop Oil's direct-action playbook and has seen several of its own members jailed.\n#DS #PH #CS Last Generation has gained notoriety in Germany for stunts inspired by Just Stop Oil (Alt: The image shows three women in orange high-visibility vests protesting outside a building with ornate stonework that has been splattered with orange liquid.

The landmark required an expensive and weeks-long clean-up to restore. The Munich public prosecutor's office is currently investigating whether Last Generation should be classified as a \"criminal organisation\" given its penchant for damaging property. The Federal government is considering new laws that would punish trespassing on airport tarmac with up to two years in prison. #DE"
