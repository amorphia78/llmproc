The demonstration has blocked road tanker traffic in and out of the Hamble terminal, which supplies fuel to service stations across the south of England. #GE Officers from Hampshire Constabulary have spoken to the campaigners but are currently allowing the protest to continue. #MS James Hill, from Extinction Rebellion, said: \"The government continues to announce paper targets to reduce emissions but it is still business as usual for fossil fuel companies. This is incompatible with the urgent need for a rapid transition away from fossil fuels to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees.\" #ME\n#PH #CS Some of the Extinction Rebellion activists locked their arms in oil barrels as part of the protest #CE\n#MS Mr Hill called \"on the government to stop the greenwash\" and \"end the subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and accelerate the transition to renewables\". #ME #NS A BP spokesperson said the company aimed to become a net zero company by \"2050 or sooner\".
