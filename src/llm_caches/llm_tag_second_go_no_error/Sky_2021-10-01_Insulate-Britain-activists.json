I included \"The government obtained an injunction last week which means anyone blocking the M25 could be found to be in contempt of court, carrying a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine.\" in a PERSONAL EFFECTS block, but this describes potential consequences rather than actual personal effects that occurred to the protesters.

Other members of the group also blocked a roundabout at junction 25 of the M25 at Waltham Cross on the boundary between north London and Hertfordshire at around 10.30am.Some activists glued their hands to the road and others chained themselves together. The action caused long queues, prompting drivers to beep their horns in frustration, with one grabbing a banner from an activist's hands.Police said protesters blocked the M4 at around 8.27am. Officers were on the scene in 13 minutes and the road was cleared by 9am, with 13 people arrested for obstruction and conspiracy to commit public nuisance.
