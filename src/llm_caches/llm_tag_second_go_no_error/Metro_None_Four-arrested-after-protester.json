  "string_data": "Looking at my previous output, I can see that I made an error. I included the phrase \"have called on fellow activists to join them for a week of civil disobedience in the run-up to the General Election on July 4\" in the messaging block, but this is not a quote from protesters or a summary of what they said - it's the article author's description of what they did. This should not be in a messaging block.\n\nHere is the corrected version:\n\nID: Metro_None_Four-arrested-after-protester\nSource: Metro\nTitle: #DS Four arrested after protester takes a dump in Rishi Sunak's back garden #DE\nContent: #DS #PH #CS Youth Demand Take a Dump in Rishi Sunak's Lake (Alt: A person wearing a shirt reading ) #CE\nFour men have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespassing after breaking into Rishi Sunak's £2,000,000 mansion and taking a dump in his garden.An activist wearing a vest which read 'eat s***' Rishi' defecated in the lake at Rishi Sunak's constituency home in Kirby Sigston, North Yorkshire, and uploaded the footage to social media. #DE #MS Youth Demand, who organised the protest, said the defecation was a 'parting gift' to the Conservative government. #ME #DS Police said they had arrested four men in connection with the incident, including one 52-year-old from London, one 43-year-old from Bolton, one 21-year-old from Manchester, and one 20-year-old from Chichester. #DE #MS The group, who describe themselves as 'a youth resistance campaign fighting for an end to genocide', said the 'political system is broken,' #ME have called on fellow activists to join them for a week of civil disobedience in the run-up to the General Election on July 4.\n#DS #PH #CS Student Oliver, 21, took part in the dirty protest (Alt: A young person in a bright yellow jacket and glasses stands by a stone wall in a well-maintained garden setting. Behind them is a manicured lawn with trees and a small pond or water feature visible. The person appears to be positioned near what looks like a garden entrance or gateway, surrounded by lush green foliage and landscaping.) #CE #DE\n#MS On their website, the group said: 'As a thank you and a parting gift to Rishi Sunak and the Tories for the last 14 years of service, a Youth Demand supporter has \"sunk the Bismarck\" in Rishi Sunak's lake. Youth Demand is a campaign calling for a two-way arms embargo on Israel and for the incoming UK government to revoke all new oil and gas licences granted since 2021.'Before performing the deed, activist Oliver, 21, said: 'We have so much to thank the Tories for: from crumbling schools, s*** in the rivers and a collapsing NHS; to creating a nation with more food banks than McDonalds and 4.3 million UK children living in poverty. From allowing their mates to get filthy rich from selling weapons to battle-test on toddlers in Gaza, or by drilling for more oil as the world burns – it's quite a legacy!' #ME"
