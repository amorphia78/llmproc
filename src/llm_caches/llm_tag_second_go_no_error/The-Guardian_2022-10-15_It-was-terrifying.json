It marked the group's 13th day of action against the use of fossil fuels. Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty Images #CE\nJust Stop Oil, a climate activist group, has vowed to block central London roads every day this October. On Thursday morning, about two dozen grim-faced campaigners staged road blocks close to Waterloo, wearing sensible clothes and hi-vis vests. They blocked three entrances to St George's Circus roundabout, one of south London's busiest junctions, attempting to superglue their hands to wet asphalt.The scene quickly became awash with flashing blue lights, dozens of police, and traffic backing up in all directions. #GE #ES #NS The protesters endured abuse from passersby as they carried out their action. #NE #EE #MS Their demand is simple: that the government agree to a moratorium on all new oil and gas projects, in line with a recommendation by the International Energy Agency. Kat, a children's mental health nurse participating in the protest, said, \"The burning of fossil fuels is killing people right now. It's fuelling the cost of living crisis, and it's driving temperatures higher and higher. So I will not stand by and watch this government commit crimes against humanity by continuing to invest in the fossil fuel industry. That is morally wrong.\" #ME\n#PH #CS Just Stop Oil protesters #CE\n#GS Just Stop Oil burst onto the activist scene in April with coordinated blockades of fuel distribution terminals in the south of England. #GE The group has received substantial funding, including donations from millionaire Dale Vince and the US-based Climate Emergency Fund.The organization has built a sophisticated activism operation, with teams dedicated to strategy, mobilization, and legal support. #ES So far, after an estimated 1,600 arrests of supporters, 79 people have been to jail, including on remand, for actions taken with Just Stop Oil. #EE Despite criticism and new laws aimed at curtailing their protest activity, Just Stop Oil remains committed to their cause. #ES As one supporter, Alex De Koning, stated about running in front of a moving oil tanker, \"It was terrifying,\" #EE #MS but the urgency of the climate crisis drives them to continue their disruptive actions. #ME\n#GS #PH #CS Just Stop Oil protester spray-paints revolving signage outside New Scotland Yard #CE #GE"
