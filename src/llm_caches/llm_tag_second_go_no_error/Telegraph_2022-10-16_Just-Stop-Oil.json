In the subtitle, I tagged \"Activists vow to ignore tougher penalties for breaching court injunctions\" as personal effects (#ES #EE), but this is not about effects of the disruptive protest on the protesters - it's about their stated intention to ignore penalties. The personal effects content should only cover the penalties themselves and the arrests that actually happened.\n\nHere is the corrected version:\n\nID: Telegraph_2022-10-16_Just-Stop-Oil\nSource: Telegraph\nTitle: #GS Just Stop Oil protesters spray paint over Aston Martin showroom and block Park Lane #GE\nSubtitle: Activists vow to ignore tougher penalties for breaching court injunctions #GS as they glue themselves to the tarmac #GE\nContent: #GS Activists from Just Stop Oil have sprayed orange paint over an Aston Martin car showroom and blocked Park Lane in central London on their 16th consecutive day of disruption. The eco-campaigners sat in Park Lane at 11am on Sunday, with some gluing themselves to the tarmac or locking themselves together. #GE The group has vowed to ignore tougher penalties for breaching court injunctions, #ES including proposed measures by Home Secretary Suella Braverman to make it a criminal offence for people to carry glue with the intention of sticking themselves to highways or each other, potentially facing six months in jail. More than 350 Just Stop Oil protesters have been arrested in London since the start of October. #EE #MS The activists are calling for the Government to halt all new oil and gas licences and consents. #ME #GS Photos and footage from the scene showed police officers trying to talk to those blocking the road while a cordon was set up around the activists. #GE\n#MS Chloe Thomas, 19, a pregnant mother and freelancer from Cannock who joined the action, expressed concern for the future, asking, \"How do I explain to my daughter in the years to come where the animals went, where the culture went, where the beauty went, why there are no bees and why I can't put food in her tummy?\" Patrick Michael John McCarthy, 67, a carer from Telford, also at the protest, said, \"Please understand these actions are not easy for any of us. It is uncomfortable, sometimes frightening and financially draining, so why do it. Because we have seen the devastating truth about the existential threats we face and cannot 'unsee' that.\" Just Stop Oil remains undeterred by the proposed legal changes, stating they will not be stopped or intimidated and will continue their campaign of civil resistance. #ME"
