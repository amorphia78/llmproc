I incorrectly tagged some of the father's statements as protester messaging when they should not be, since the messaging category is specifically for messages from protesters or their allies about their protest cause, not from family members explaining the situation.\n\nHere is the corrected version:\n\nID: Telegraph_2021-02-13_I-wont-rest\nSource: Telegraph\nTitle: 'I won't rest until my daughter is safe and out of that tunnel'\nSubtitle: #GS Environmental activist Roc Sandford explains the concerns – and pride – he feels over his daughter hiding underground to protest HS2 #GE\nContent: #GS Environmental activist Roc Sandford, 62, is deeply concerned about his 18-year-old daughter, Blue, who is hiding in 100ft of makeshift tunnels beneath Euston Square Gardens in London to protest against HS2. Blue, described as Britain's answer to Greta Thunberg, entered the tunnels with a group of six other protesters more than two weeks ago.The protesters include Daniel Hooper, the 47-year-old green campaigner known as \"Swampy\", and his 16-year-old son, Rory. #GE #ES Sandford believes Blue has enough food to last her for six weeks and is keeping in touch via her mobile phone.The tunnels are dark and dangerous, lacking proper safety equipment and oxygen monitors. Machinery could destabilize the tunnels, according to safety experts. Sandford expresses deep concern for his daughter's safety, saying, \"I'm very concerned for her safety.\" #EE Blue, who has been on a school strike since completing her GCSEs at a private school in north London, has written a book called \"Challenge Everything\" encouraging young people to save the world. Sandford describes her as tough and safety-conscious, having grown up between the harsh conditions of Gometra island and an off-grid house in London.\n#GS #PH #CS Roc Sandford's daughter Blue is currently in tunnels beneath Euston Square Gardens #CE #GE\n#GS Sandford supports his daughter's protest, despite the government stating that the cost of tackling climate activists at HS2 sites has hit nearly £50 million. #GE He believes there is no place for a new fast train network requiring a huge amount of carbon. \"People are in denial; the world has changed – it's like the third runway at Heathrow and the coalmine in Cumbria – the sooner these projects are cancelled, the less money is wasted and the fewer lives are put at risk,\" he says. While acknowledging his privileged position, Sandford argues that everyone must act to protect the environment. He draws parallels with historical figures, stating, \"The experiences of Gandhi, Martin Luther King and the suffragettes show us that when a government isn't doing what it needs to be doing in a crisis, non-violent direct action is a way to wake it up.\""
