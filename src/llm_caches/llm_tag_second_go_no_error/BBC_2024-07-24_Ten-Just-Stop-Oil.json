Continued burning of oil, gas and coal, as we pass irreversible tipping points that threaten to spin our climate out of control in a rapidly accelerating way, is jeopardising the stability on which our entire society depends.\" #ME\n#DS #PH #CS Ten Just Stop Oil supporters were arrested at Heathrow (Alt: The image shows an American Airlines aircraft on a runway at what appears to be Heathrow Airport. In the foreground, several people are gathered near a white van behind airport perimeter fencing. British Airways planes are visible in the background on the tarmac, with airport buildings and green grass areas surrounding the runways.) #CE #DE\nA spokesman for Heathrow Airport said: #NS \"There has been absolutely no impact on operations whatsoever\" and that \"no-one gained entry to anywhere they shouldn't be.\"Thanks to swift action from the police and airport colleagues, there is no disruption to passenger journeys.\"Heathrow continues to operate as normal today.\" #NE #DS Earlier this month, the High Court granted an injunction prohibiting anyone from entering, occupying or remaining on London Heathrow Airport land in connection with environmental campaigns, without consent.Anyone breaching the injunction might be jailed, fined or have their assets seized for contempt of court.The action follows the imposition of long jail sentences on five members of JSO who disrupted the M25 in 2022. #DE #PS The sentences - of four and five years - were described in an open letter signed by hundreds of high-profile names - as \"one of the greatest injustices in a British court in modern history\". #PE"
