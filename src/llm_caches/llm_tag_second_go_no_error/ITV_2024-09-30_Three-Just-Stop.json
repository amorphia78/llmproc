I failed to tag the protester messaging content - specifically the \"Just Stop Oil\" t-shirts that the protesters revealed, which is clearly messaging they were trying to convey.\n\nHere is the corrected version:\n\nID: ITV_2024-09-30_Three-Just-Stop\nSource: ITV\nTitle: #DS Three Just Stop Oil activists deny 'revenge' soup attack on Van Gogh paintings at National Gallery #DE\nContent: #PH #CS Just Stop Oil court case (Alt: Three people stand outside a building, with two wearing white ) #CE\n#DS Three Just Stop Oil supporters have denied carrying out an attack on two Van Gogh paintings after soup was thrown at them hours after other activists were jailed, a court heard.The paintings, both versions of Vincent Van Gogh's Sunflowers, were targeted at the National Gallery in central London on Friday shortly after two Just Stop Oil activists were jailed for pouring soup over a Sunflowers by the Dutch artist in October 2022.Stephen Simpson, 71, Mary Somerville, 77, and Phillipa Green, 24, pleaded not guilty to criminal damage at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday.Prosecutor James Bowker told the court that the defendants entered the Van Gogh: Poets and Lovers exhibition at the art museum in Trafalgar Square at around 2.30pm on Friday.
