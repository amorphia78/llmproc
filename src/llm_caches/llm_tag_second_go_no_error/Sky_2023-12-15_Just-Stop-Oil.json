The statement from Lawyers are Responsible that I tagged as #NS...#NE is actually expressing criticism of the sentence/system, not criticism of the protest, protesters, or protest effects. According to the rules, negative comments must be criticism \"of the protest, protesters, or the protest's effects\" specifically.\n\nHere is the corrected version:\n\nID: Sky_2023-12-15_Just-Stop-Oil\nSource: Sky\nTitle: #DS Just Stop Oil protester jailed for six months for 'peaceful' march on London's Brent Cross Flyover #DE\nSubtitle: A group called Lawyers are Responsible claims the sentence shows the \"increasingly repressive\" way climate protesters are dealt with.\nContent: #PH #CS Father-of-three Stephen Gingell pleaded guilty.

Failure to do so has led to their arrest.\" #DE\n#PH #CS Protesters were also moved on outside Keir Starmer's house this week. (Alt: The image shows several police officers in high-visibility yellow jackets and helmets during a nighttime scene.

The scene is dimly lit with some background lighting visible.) #CE\nA statement from a group called Lawyers are Responsible - released by Just Stop Oil - said the sentence showed \"the increasingly repressive environment that people find themselves in when they take entirely peaceful action to express concern about the climate and ecological crisis\". #MS Just Stop Oil - which wants to stop all future fossil fuel projects in the UK #ME - #DS has disrupted roads in London multiple times, as well as protesting at sports and theatre events.Its latest stunt was on Thursday, when it turned up at Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's home to sing climate-themed Christmas carols.Met Police said officers attended but made no arrests after the protesters were moved on.Rishi Sunak's London home was also targeted by the group last month. #DE"
