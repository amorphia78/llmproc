The protesters climbed onto the 52,000-tonne heavy-lift vessel just north of the Canary Islands on Tuesday morning, displaying a banner demanding that the fossil fuel giant #MS \"Stop drilling – start paying\" #ME. The activists reached the vessel in three boats launched from Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise ship and used ropes to scale the deck. They then occupied the platform, which is being carried on the back of the vessel. #GE One of the occupiers, Usnea Granger, described the boarding as \"a bit of an adventure\" due to the swell. She explained that #MS the protest was personal for her, citing friends and farmers in the US who have been forced to flee their homes due to climate-related disasters. #ME #MS The protesters are demanding action against the climate devastation around the world \"caused by Shell and the wider fossil fuel industry, without paying a penny towards loss and damage\". #ME The platform will enable Shell to further exploit the Penguins oil and gas field off the Shetland Islands, potentially unlocking eight new wells.\n#GS #PH #CS Greenpeace activists before heading out to board and occupy the Shell platform. #CE #GE\nShell, which is expected to unveil adjusted annual profits of around $83bn this week, described the redevelopment of the Penguins field as an \"attractive opportunity\". The company estimates it will produce 45,000 barrels of oil or equivalent in gas every day at its peak. #NS Shell expressed safety concerns about the protest, stating, \"These actions are causing real safety concerns, with a number of people boarding a moving vessel in rough conditions.\" The company defended the project, arguing that it is consistent with net zero pathways and will help reduce the UK's reliance on costly, higher carbon imports. #NE Greenpeace has calculated that burning all the gas and oil from the Penguins field could create 45m tonnes of CO2 - more than the entire annual emissions of Norway.\n#GS #PH #CS Greenpeace activists at sunrise prepare to board a Shell oil platform. #CE #GE"
