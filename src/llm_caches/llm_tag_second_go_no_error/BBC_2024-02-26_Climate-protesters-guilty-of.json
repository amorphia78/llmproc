He accepted that the three protesters waited for a break in play, but added: #NS \"Nevertheless, I find as a fact that each of them intended to cause disruption to the tennis and as a result, they did cause some disruption on that day.\" #NE #DS The court was told Wilde and Milner-Edwards entered Court 18 at around 14:10 BST on 5 July last year, during the Grand Slam match between Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov and Japan's Sho Shimabukuro.

Ward's protest was met with louder \"boos\" from the crowd.Wilde and Ward were each given a six-month conditional discharge, while Milner-Edwards received an 18-month conditional discharge. #DE"
