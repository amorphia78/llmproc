The group threw soup on to the glass case of Mona Lisa in the Louvre in January.A source at Orsay Museum said the 1873 work by Monet, which it describes as \"one of the world's most famous paintings\", was inspected, found to be undamaged and put back on display the same day. #DE #NS Under French law, activists face up to seven years in prison and a fine of €100,000 for \"destroying, damaging or deteriorating\" a cultural item. But if there is no damage to the work, they often escape prosecution, according to lawyers. #NE\n#MS A member of the French branch of Extinction Rebellion told Le Figaro this year: \"The actions are not violent and they do not damage the artworks and so they are not criminally punishable.\" #ME #NS #PH #CS Rachida Dati said such attacks targeted \"the most noble aspect of our cohesion — culture\" (Alt: A professional woman in a navy blue blazer and shirt walks while carrying a dark folder or tablet.

In the Netherlands, two Just Stop Oil campaigners received jail sentences for gluing themselves to the glass protection of Girl with the Pearl Earring, though this was later overturned. Similar protests have targeted historical documents including the Magna Carta. #DE\n#DS #PH #CS Just Stop Oil protesters in their eighties target Magna Carta (Alt: Two elderly protesters wearing glasses stand indoors holding signs.
