The group threw soup on to the glass case of Mona Lisa in the Louvre in January.\n\nA source at Orsay Museum said the 1873 work by Monet, which it describes as \"one of the world's most famous paintings\", was inspected, found to be undamaged and put back on display the same day.\n\nUnder French law, activists face up to seven years in prison and a fine of €100,000 for \"destroying, damaging or deteriorating\" a cultural item. But if there is no damage to the work, they often escape prosecution, according to lawyers.\n\nA member of the French branch of Extinction Rebellion told Le Figaro this year: \"The actions are not violent and they do not damage the artworks and so they are not criminally punishable.\"\n\nDati wants to change the law to ensure protesters no longer go unpunished in such cases.\n\n\"Once again, a cultural institution and an artwork have been targeted by iconoclasts,\" she said.\n\nShe said she had asked the justice ministry to implement \"a criminal policy adapted to this new form of crime which attacks the most noble aspect of our cohesion — culture\".\n\nOfficials in France and other European countries have struggled to deal with activists who target protected cultural items without causing damage, including recent Just Stop Oil protests targeting the Magna Carta."
