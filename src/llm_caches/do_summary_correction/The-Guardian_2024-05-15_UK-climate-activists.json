But after jurors were directed to only take into account whether or not the protest had caused \"significant\" disruption to the roads, they found the defendants guilty in an 11-1 majority verdict.\n\nOver a five-day trial, Southwark crown court heard that on 15 November last year Plummer, Sarti and Hall took part in a slow march protest along Earls Court Road as part of the Just Stop Oil campaign, which calls on the government to ban new licences for oil and gas exploitation in the UK.\n\nThe court heard the protest had caused long tailbacks, including on the Cromwell Road, part of the A4, and reaching as far away as the Hammersmith flyover, with traffic held up for several hours.\n\nIn their defence, Plummer, Sarti and Hall said their protest was designed to minimise the amount of disruption caused to drivers, while still causing enough to gain media coverage of their demand that the government introduce a ban on new licences for oil and gas exploitation.\n\nPlummer told the jury: \"I want to prevent the massive disruption to all of us, from flooded roads, homes, and fields, from heat that melts roads and runways and is already killing and displacing millions around the world.\" Hall asked: \"Isn't it more reckless to spend the final two to three years we have left to avoid climate breakdown signing petitions and politely protesting by the side of the road?\"\n\nThe trio will be sentenced on 3 July. The maximum penalty is 12 months imprisonment, an unlimited fine or both."
