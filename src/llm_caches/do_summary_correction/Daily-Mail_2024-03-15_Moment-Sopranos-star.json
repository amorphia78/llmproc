I am a theater artist,' the rebel shouted before being escorted offstage by security.\n\nThe protestor continued: 'The oceans are rising. It will swallow this city and this entire theater whole. I am putting my career on the line because we are not doing anything about this crisis. The water is coming for us!'\n\n'Go back drama school!' Imperioli yelled in true gangster fashion.\n\nStrong, still in character retorted loudly 'let them speak.'\n\nImperioli then left the stage and helped to shove the activist up the stairs and out of the theater.\n\nWhen the final activist was kicked out of the theatre, the majority of the room applauded.\n\nImperioli posted a response to the incident on Instagram, suggesting that while his persona might not agree with the demonstrators, he still values science.\n\n'Tonight was wild….no hard feelings extinction rebellion crew,' he wrote. 'Michael is on your side but mayor stockmann is not. Much love.'\n\nA statement released by the climate change group said: 'Today's action highlights the failure of governments and corporations to treat climate and ecological breakdown as the crisis it is.'"
