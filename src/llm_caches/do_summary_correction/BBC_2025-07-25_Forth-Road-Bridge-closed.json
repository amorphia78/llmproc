The group accused the firm, and its owner, Jim Ratcliffe, of attempting to sabotage a global plastics treaty due to be voted on by UN member states in Switzerland next month.\n\nPolice Scotland have urged drivers and pedestrians to avoid the area around the bridge. Images from the scene show protesters on wires holding red banners displaying a number of slogans decrying Ineos' influence in the plastics industry.\n\nGreenpeace said the \"climbers\" were being supported by a rescue team on the bridge and a boat below and would remain suspended 25m (82ft) above the Firth of Forth's main shipping lane. The group has blocked the deep water shipping lane, preventing larger vessels from accessing the channel, however smaller boats are unaffected.\n\nPolice Scotland said they were \"engaging\" with those involved. The bridge has been closed to private transport since 2018 following the opening of the Queensferry Crossing and is now used as a public transport corridor.\n\nGreenpeace has called on governments to commit to cutting global plastic production by at least 75% by 2040. Greenpeace programme director Amy Cameron said she was concerned Ineos and owner Ratcliffe would \"do everything they can to stop\" an agreement being signed.\n\nShe added: \"Ratcliffe tries to distract us with sports teams and sponsorships, but we're not going to let him fill our planet with plastic, so he can fill his pockets with profit. Ratcliffe is trying to block a strong Global Plastics Treaty, so today we're blocking him.\"\n\nIneos described the action by Greenpeace as \"dangerous, disruptive, and entirely counterproductive,\" adding it \"threatened skilled jobs in Scotland\". The company said unless groups like Greenpeace stop attacking companies and start supporting waste infrastructure and advanced recycling, \"they are actively contributing to the problem\" and \"standing in the way of the very solutions that are needed\"."
