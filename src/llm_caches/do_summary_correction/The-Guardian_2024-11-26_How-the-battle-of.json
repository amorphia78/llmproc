  "string_data": "Thirty years ago, in November 1994, 700 police officers and bailiffs in riot gear marched into Claremont Road in east London and waged battle against about 500 activists, who were dug in – some of them literally – against efforts to evict them. The activists occupied rooftop towers, treehouses, underground bunkers and even secret tunnels. It took three days to get them all out.\n\nThe \"Battle of Claremont Road\" was fought against the construction of the six-lane A12, also known as the M11 link road. The road had been planned since the 1960s as part of the Conservative government's determination to carry out \"the biggest road-building programme since the Romans\". By 1994, Claremont Road was the last street standing after the Department for Transport had begun repossessing and demolishing houses along the route.\n\nThe protesters included unemployed activists, PhD students, journalists, and aspiring photographers. Campaigner Camilla Berens recalls: \"I think the whole of alternative London turned up.\" The street became a countercultural attraction with colourful murals, outdoor sculptures, and a public cafe.\n\nAs the showdown approached, protesters built elaborate defences: Dolly, a scaffolding structure 30 metres high; treehouses connected by webs of netting and walkways; roadblocks made of cars and shopping trolleys filled with concrete; and underground bunkers described by one activist as \"very elaborate womb-like structures\". They knocked together upper floors to create a rat run and built a tunnel out of oil drums running underneath back gardens.\n\nThe callout came on 27 November. The next morning, an estimated 500 protesters were ready across rooftops, bunkers, treehouses, nets, and walkways. When police arrived in what one participant described as \"stormtrooper gear with batons raised\", they found activists had drilled holes into the asphalt with lock-on bolts, lying down with their arms through holes and locking their wrists with handcuffs.\n\nThe protesters maintained a strong commitment to non-violence. Police spent more than £1m on the eviction, using mechanical diggers, cherrypickers, and metal detectors to find the secret tunnel.\n\nThough the road was built, the protest turned the roads programme into a political issue and paved the way for subsequent campaigns such as Reclaim the Streets, Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil."
