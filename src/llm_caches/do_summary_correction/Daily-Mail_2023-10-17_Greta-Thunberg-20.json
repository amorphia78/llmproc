The 20-year-old Swedish activist could be seen smiling as she was detained by officers and led to a waiting police van after joining a protest outside the Energy Intelligence Forum (EIF) at the Intercontinental Hotel Park Lane.\n\nThe Met Police said it had arrested 21 protesters. Fossil Free London, which organised the demo, said that Thunberg was arrested while linking arms and chanting with other activists. Fossil Free London activists banged drums and chanted 'oily, oily money, out, out, out' as they blocked the hotel entrance.\n\nSpeaking at the protest prior to her arrest, Ms Thunberg said: 'Behind these closed doors at the Oil and Money conference, spineless politicians are making deals and compromises with lobbyists from destructive industries - the fossil fuel industry. People all over the world are suffering and dying from the consequences of the climate crisis, caused by these industries.'\n\nShe added: 'The world is drowning in fossil fuels. Our hopes and dreams and lives are being washed away by a flood of greenwashing and lies. That is why we have to take direct action to stop this and to physically disrupt. We have to kick oily money out of politics.'\n\nThunberg continued: 'We cannot rely on politicians and the people in power to save us. They have proven time and time again that they always prioritise the fossil fuel industry above people. We have to reclaim the power.'\n\nThe force arrested six people on suspicion of obstructing a highway and 14 more protesters for breaching section 14 of the Public Order Act. Officers imposed conditions 'to prevent serious disruption to the community, hotel and guests.'\n\nThe Energy Intelligence Forum says it is a 'platform for fostering debate...and finding answers to the big questions facing the energy industry'."
