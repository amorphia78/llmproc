In March, she was detained on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle and of sending a malicious communication after the Mail exposed an alleged plot to target MPs.\n\nThe privately-educated activist has now been arrested for breaching her bail conditions, with footage showing her walking up to MP Emily Thornberry's door. The video posted on social media shows Plummer posting the letter with a friend. It then cuts to show several police officers asking if she has ID.\n\nAn officer then returns, and said: 'We've just spoken to our inspector... you will be under arrest for breaching police bail conditions.' He then asks if she was aware of the bail conditions not to attend a MP's home address.\n\nSpeaking to the camera, she then said: 'So apparently this is the world we live in now. Getting arrested, literally for just posting a letter through to somebody's house...somebody's front door. That's so far from a crime, isn't it?'\n\nTo which the police officer replied: 'You've got these bail conditions for a reason, haven't you.'\n\nShe responded: 'To prevent that. This is what it was trying to prevent. Just delivering a letter.'\n\nThe video cuts to footage of a police van arriving, and Plummer climbs in before turning and waving, saying: 'See you guys later!' and laughs.\n\nPink-haired Plummer grew up in privilege, raised in a £4million family home near the King's Road in Chelsea and privately educated at £45,000-a year St Mary's School in Ascot, Berkshire, then £34,000-a-year Mander Portman Woodward College in Kensington, west London."
