Last year was the first time global temperatures passed the threshold of 1.5C above their pre-industrial level. Staying below that mark was one of the key commitments of the global Paris Climate Treaty which countries agreed to in 2015, in a bid to avert the most dangerous impacts of climate change.\n\nJSO said Alyson Lee, 66, a retired teaching assistant from Derby, and Di Bligh, a 77-year-old former chief executive of Reading Council, from Rode, were involved in the protest.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police confirmed two women were arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage \"with what is believed to be powdered paint at Westminster Abbey\". Officers led two women away from the abbey after the protest.\n\nMs Lee said ministers are \"are not doing enough [on climate change].\" Ms Bligh told the Press Association they had done it \"because there's no hope for the world, really\" and said they chose Darwin's grave because, as a \"good scientist\", he would support their aims and \"would be as upset as us with the government for ignoring the science\".\n\nAccording to JSO, the two supporters were heard saying: \"2024 was the hottest year on record. We have passed the 1.5 degree threshold that was supposed to keep us safe. The government's plans will take us to over three degrees of warming. World leaders must stop burning oil, gas and coal by 2030.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the church confirmed orange paint had been sprayed onto the gravestone, but they do not think there will be any permanent damage."
