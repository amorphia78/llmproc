They can censor us, but they cannot censor reality,' the Italian branch of Last Generation wrote on X.\n\nOn a fundraising page to cover 'legal fees, travel and accommodation costs' for their activists, Last Generation reacted to the new law by writing: 'Despite the \"ecoprotest\" law, despite precautionary measures, despite increasingly grotesque oppression, we do not stop and continue to take actions.\n\n'We continue because there is no justice for the victims of landslides and floods [...].\n\n'We demand that the government takes responsibility for caring for the victims of these disasters [in Campi Bisenzio and Emilia-Romagna]. To seek justice, we accept the legal risks.'\n\nEco-vandals in Italy could now be fined up to £50,000 under the new bill. The law aims to stop such protests, giving officials the power to levy fines of between 20,000 euros (£17,000) to 60,000 euros (£50,000)."
