Celebrities spoke out in anger at the lengthy sentences - and a United Nations official described their treatment as \"not acceptable in a democracy\".\n\nWith Roger Hallam, the architect of the modern environmental protest movement, and his co-conspirators now behind bars, this might have been \"checkmate\" in a five-year long game of legal chess between the state and a group of increasingly bold direct action environmental groups.\n\nThe M25 five got their sentences because they had been lead conspirators in a plan to get 45 people to bring the entirety of London's orbital motorway to a halt. At their trial the defendants were unable to use climate change as a lawful excuse for their actions, with periods when some refused to co-operate with the judge at all as he told them to restrict what they were saying in court.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC exclusively in a recorded message from his prison cell this week, Hallam stood by his actions. \"The strategic moral imperative is resistance to the greatest [crisis] in the history of humanity\", the JSO co-founder said. Direct action remains \"the right strategy\", he added, confident that while in the short run some people may be deterred, others will only grow more determined.\n\nIn the face of this disorder the state felt compelled to act. It's now a crime to \"lock on\" to an object with super glue, but the most important new power is the crime of causing a public nuisance. An activist can be guilty of causing public nuisance if they do something that causes \"serious harm\" to the public, defined by Parliament as causing \"serious annoyance\" and \"serious inconvenience\".\n\nThe protesters have repeatedly said their reasonable excuse is they are drawing attention to their fears for the planet, but judges say this is not a legal defence."
