The protests over the past four weeks coincided with the British government confirming in the king's speech its plans to grant new North Sea oil and gas licences every year.\n\nPolice are using new powers to make the mass arrests under section 7 of the Conservative government's Public Order Act 2023, which bans any action that \"interferes with the use or operation of any key national infrastructure\". According to data gathered by Just Stop Oil, almost half of the arrests were carried out under section 7. The offence carries a prison sentence of up to 12 months.\n\nEvidence reveals some people have been held in police custody for long periods after arrest. A 23-year-old was arrested within five minutes of joining a demonstration and held for 56 hours in custody. A 19-year-old student was held for three nights in a London prison despite being given bail by a magistrates court. Another 19-year-old student was held for 50 hours in a London police cell.\n\nJun Pang, a policy and campaigns officer for Liberty, said: \"The staggering number of people arrested in recent weeks shows just how sweeping and dangerous these powers are. It's shocking to see hundreds of young protesters criminalised simply for standing up for what they believe in.\"\n\nJust Stop Oil said: \"They're imprisoning peaceful protesters, protecting the real criminals, and licensing more than 100 new oil and gas projects while everything burns.\""
