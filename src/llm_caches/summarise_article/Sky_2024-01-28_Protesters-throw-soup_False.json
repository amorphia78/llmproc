Footage shows two women ducking a security barrier to get close to the painting, shouting \"our farming system is sick\".\n\nProtesters have thrown red soup at the Mona Lisa painting in the Louvre in Paris. Footage shows two women crossing a security boundary to get closer to the painting, with both throwing soup towards the Leonardo da Vinci artwork.\n\nBoth are wearing a shirt with Riposte Alimentaire - which translates as food response - written on the front, referring to a climate activist group.\n\n\"What's the most important thing?\" the women shouted. \"Art, or right to healthy and sustainable food?\"\n\n\"Our farming system is sick, our farmers are dying at work,\" they added.\n\nMuseum staff then rushed to the painting with black screens in a bid to block the public's view and asked visitors to evacuate the room immediately.\n\nTwo people were arrested following the incident, Paris police said.\n\nA glass window protects the Mona Lisa, meaning the soup would not have covered the painting itself.\n\nRiposte Alimentaire claims two people - aged 24 and 63 - involved with their \"new campaign\" were behind the incident to \"demand the establishment of sustainable food social security\".\n\nThe world's most famous artwork has been targeted before. In May 2022, cake was smeared on the covering, with bystanders claiming a \"man dressed as an old lady\" jumped out of a wheelchair before trying to smash the protective glass. The gallery explained the culprit had managed to get close to the portrait by \"simulating a disability\", allowing them to take advantage of a policy designed to help people with mobility problems see the major works in its collection clearly."
