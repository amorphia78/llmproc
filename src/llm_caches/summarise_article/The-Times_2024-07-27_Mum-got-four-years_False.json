Judge Christopher Hehir told the court that Lancaster and her co-conspirators, Roger Hallam, 58, Daniel Shaw, 38, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, 35, and Cressida Gethin, 22, had \"some time ago … crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic.\"\n\nThe protest caused \"massive disruption\", including missed exams, funerals and cancer appointments. It allegedly cost the Met Police £1.1m and impacted around 700,000 vehicles, leaving the motorway \"compromised\" for more than 120 hours. Lancaster did not herself take part in the November protest, but she paid more than £1,000 to rent the Airbnb where protesters stayed, and also bought climbing equipment.\n\nOn the Zoom call, Hallam, the co-founder of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, said that they intended to cause \"the biggest disruption in British modern history\" in an effort to force the government to meet one of Just Stop Oil's core demands: an end to new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.\n\nIn a decision that has provoked fierce debate, Hallam was jailed for five years for conspiracy to cause a public nuisance, while Lancaster was sentenced to four years, along with Shaw, Whittaker De Abreu and Gethin. Lancaster, who studied maths at Oxford, had previously climbed a gantry on the M25 in an earlier protest in July 2022."
