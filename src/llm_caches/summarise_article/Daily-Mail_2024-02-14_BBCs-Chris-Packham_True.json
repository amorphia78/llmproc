  "string_data": "PRIMARY: Cambridge music student Cressida Gethin, 22, is on trial for scaling a motorway gantry above the M25 near Heathrow on July 20, 2022, as part of a Just Stop Oil protest. The action caused 4-5 hours of traffic disruption the day after the UK's hottest temperature was recorded. She denies causing public nuisance, claiming she didn't intend \"spectacular disruption\" but realized it was more effective than expected.\n\nSECONDARY: No secondary protest actions mentioned.\n\nOTHER FOCAL: BBC broadcaster Chris Packham testified as a defense witness, stating he \"selectively\" supports Just Stop Oil actions. Despite being stuck in the resulting traffic jam, he said he came to sympathize with the protesters' motivations regarding climate change.\n\nTONE: The article maintains a neutral, factual tone focused on court proceedings rather than expressing judgment about the protest."
