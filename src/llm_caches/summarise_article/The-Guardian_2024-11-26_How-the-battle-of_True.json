  "string_data": "PRIMARY: In November 1994, approximately 500 environmental activists occupied Claremont Road in east London for three days to protest the M11 link road construction. The protesters included squatters, artists, students, and unemployed activists who built elaborate defenses including a 100ft scaffolding tower, treehouses, underground bunkers, and tunnels. They demanded to stop the road that would destroy their community and prioritize cars over environment. Police spent over £1m removing them.\n\nSECONDARY: The campaign led directly to forming Reclaim the Streets in 1995, which staged guerrilla anti-car street parties, and influenced later movements like Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil.\n\nOTHER FOCAL: Though the road was built, the protest helped turn road-building into a political issue, contributing to Labour cutting major road schemes from 150 to 37 when elected in 1997.\n\nTONE: The article presents a positive, celebratory tone toward the protest, describing it as historically significant and praising the activists' creativity and commitment to non-violence."
