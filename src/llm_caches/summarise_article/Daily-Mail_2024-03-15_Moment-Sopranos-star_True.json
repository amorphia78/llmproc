One protester, identifying as a theater artist, warned about rising oceans and climate crisis while being escorted out by cast members including Michael Imperioli, who shoved the activist up the stairs while remaining in character.\n\nSECONDARY: No secondary protest actions mentioned.\n\nOTHER FOCAL: Some audience members initially thought the disruption was part of the show since the play addresses environmental concerns. Imperioli later posted on Instagram clarifying he personally supports the cause despite his character's reaction.\n\nTONE: The article maintains a relatively neutral tone, describing the incident factually while noting audience applause when protesters were removed."
