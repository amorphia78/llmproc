You couldn't have cared less if the painting was damaged or not. You had no right to do what you did to Sunflowers.\"\n\nThe judge told Plummer: \"You clearly think your beliefs give you the right to commit crimes when you feel like it. You do not.\"\n\nJudge Hehir said they \"came within the width of a pane of glass of destroying one of the most valuable artworks in the world\".\n\nPainted in Arles in the south of France in August 1888, van Gogh's painting shows 15 sunflowers standing in a yellow pot against a yellow background."
