Art can be, and frequently is, iconoclasm. These activists should not receive custodial sentences for an act that connects entirely to the artistic canon.\"\n\nSuch iconoclasm has been recognised as part of art for more than 120 years, they said, citing the work of artists including Banksy, who shredded one of his paintings during an auction in 2018.\n\nThe artists added: \"The work of all these iconoclasts, often far more physically destructive than the work of JSO, is now venerated in museums around the world.\"\n\nAreeba Hamid, a co-executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: \"We sincerely hope the judge will listen carefully to the artists' arguments. We need to stop locking away peaceful protesters in our overcrowded prisons simply for raising the alarm on a burning planet.\""
