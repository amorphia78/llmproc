Police appeared to successfully call for the crowd to move away.\n\nThe minivan was also carrying a child and at least one other passenger.\n\nPeople standing front of the vehicle, some holding a JSO banner, were seen holding their hands up, with one shouting to the police \"officer, I'm being pushed back\".\n\nThe driver exited the vehicle and could be heard remonstrating with the protesters about the road being blocked.\n\nPolice reminded the man the disruption was temporary and people had a right to protest.\n\nOther similar incidents of drivers apparently becoming frustrated with people in the road were also caught on camera.\n\nIn its March statement announcing the end of direct action, the group said: \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history.\n\n\"We've kept over 4.4 billion barrels of oil in the ground and the courts have ruled new oil and gas licences unlawful.\"\n\nThe Labour government has said it will not issue licences for new oil and gas exploration, while a series of recent court cases have halted fossil fuel projects including oil drilling in Surrey, a coal mine in Cumbria and the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields in the North Sea over climate pollution.\n\nLabour has distanced itself from Just Stop Oil, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer criticising its actions and saying protesters must face the full force of the law.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police have been approached for comment."
