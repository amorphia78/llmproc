On Thursday, his case was transferred to Manchester magistrates court, where he was sentenced to six months.\n\nJust Stop Oil has been campaigning since 2022 for the UK government to stop all new fossil fuel production. The campaign's \"guerrilla tactics\" were cited by the Home Office when it introduced the Public Order Act's tough new anti-protest measures to parliament.\n\nA spokesperson for the campaign said: \"Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, a law drafted by the fossil fuel lobby, was introduced in April by Priti Patel, and covers 'interference with the use or operation of key national infrastructure'. It seems this government has now made walking down the road, walking on the public highway an illegal act that is worthy of imprisonment.\"\n\nThe human rights organisation Liberty criticised Gingell's sentencing. Katy Watts, a lawyer at Liberty, said: \"It is shocking to see such harsh sentences handed down to protesters. This is yet another unnecessary and draconian law introduced by a government that is hell-bent on discouraging people from standing up for what they believe in.\""
