  "string_data": "PRIMARY: Extinction Rebellion activists disrupted the Travelers Championship by invading the 18th green during the tournament's climax on Sunday. One activist was preparing to release a bag of orange powder before being tackled by security and losing grip of it. The protest caused a brief five-minute pause in play between frontrunners Scottie Scheffler and Tom Kim.\n\nSECONDARY: The article references a previous incident where PGA player Adam Hadwin was tackled by security at last year's Canadian Open when he joined celebrations without wearing credentials.\n\nOTHER FOCAL: The article focuses significantly on Scheffler's tournament victory and his achievement of winning six times before July, matching Arnold Palmer's 1962 record.\n\nTONE: The article maintains a neutral to slightly dismissive tone toward the protest, treating it more as a minor disruption than a serious environmental action."
