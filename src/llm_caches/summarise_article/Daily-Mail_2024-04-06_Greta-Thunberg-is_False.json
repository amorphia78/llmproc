Video footage shows the moment two burly cops dumped the climate activist on a coach.\n\nThe incident happened on Saturday after Thunberg and a group of marchers blocked a main road in a protest organised by the Extinction Rebellion group. She had joined hundreds of protesters on a walk down from The Hague's city centre to the A12 arterial highway that connects the seat of the Dutch government with other cities including Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht.\n\nDozens of police officers, including some on horseback, blocked the group from accessing the motorway, warning that 'violence could be used' should the marchers try to get onto the road. They were carrying environmental group flags and placards saying 'Stop fuel subsidies now!' and 'The planet is dying!'.\n\nThe chanting protesters were then locked in a tense standoff with police who formed a wall of law enforcement. Thunberg joined in with the chants and slogans during the protest.\n\n'It's important to demonstrate today because we are living in a state of planetary emergency,' Thunberg told AFP as police blocked marchers. 'We must do everything to avoid that crisis and to save human lives,' she said.\n\nSome activists found another route and blocked a main road close to the highway where they - including Thunberg - sat down on the tarmac. Asked whether she was concerned about police action and arrest, Thunberg said: 'Why should I be?'\n\nThunberg was arrested and dragged away by police to a waiting touring bus where she was detained with other activists. She told the ANP national news agency by telephone that her arrest had proceeded 'calmly'. 'It's not about the arrest. I am here for the climate,' she said.\n\nA spokesman for the Public Prosecutor's Office confirmed the protesters were briefly detained before being released."
