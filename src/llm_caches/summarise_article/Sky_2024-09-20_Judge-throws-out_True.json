  "string_data": "PRIMARY: Four Greenpeace activists (Amy Rugg-Easey, 33, Alexandra Wilson, 32, Mathieu Soete, 38, and Michael Grant, 64) scaled Rishi Sunak's grade II-listed manor house using ladders and ropes, draping black fabric over the property during a five-hour demonstration. They were protesting the expansion of oil and gas drilling in the North Sea and targeted Sunak's home because issuing new fossil fuel licences was his \"personal\" decision. A judge threw out criminal damage charges, finding evidence \"so tenuous\" that no court would convict them.\n\nSECONDARY: None mentioned.\n\nOTHER FOCAL: The article focuses on the legal proceedings, including prosecution claims of £3,000 in roof damage and defence arguments that pre-existing damage couldn't be attributed to the protesters.\n\nTONE: The article maintains a neutral, factual tone reporting on the court proceedings and outcome."
