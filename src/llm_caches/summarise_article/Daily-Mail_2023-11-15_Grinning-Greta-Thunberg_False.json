The building had been hosting a meeting of oil executives at the time.\n\nThunberg and 25 other protesters were arrested and later charged with public order offences after allegedly refusing to leave the highway and continue their demonstration on the pavement. On Wednesday morning Thunberg and four other Fossil Free London protesters pleaded not guilty to breaching Section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986 at Westminster Magistrates' Court.\n\nThe protest targeted the Energy Intelligence Forum 2023, which brought together 'various decision makers and innovators and other stake holders form energy, finance, and business industries'. The EIF was due to hear from the chief executives of Aramco, Repsol, Shell, TotalEnergies and the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.\n\nProsecutor Luke Staton told the court that protesters 'began taking up positions around the entrance to the hotel thereby effectively preventing people from coming in and out, some had managed to climb onto roof and abseiled down and others sat in the road attempting to block the particular access to that location.'\n\nThe protesters were allowed to continue for approximately 5 hours until 12:32 pm when Superintendent Cox imposed conditions under section 14 that 'the protest must continue on the pavement on the south of Intercontinental Hotel.' After failing to move onto the designated protest area, Thunberg and others were subsequently arrested.\n\nAt the protest, Thunberg had urged eco-activists to 'reclaim the power' and slammed 'spineless' politicians for failing to act on global climate change. The protesters were granted unconditional bail ahead of trial on February 1, 2024."
