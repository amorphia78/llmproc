We are in crisis, we are in crisis. Our whole future is in jeopardy'.\n\nHe was taken out of the conference hall to a Merseyside Police van and arrested.\n\nJSO also shared footage of the stage-invasion linking it to their demand that Sir Keir 'commits to revoking the oil and gas licences granted by this zombie Tory government'.\n\nAshmawi - who has his own website - describes himself as an Extinction Rebellion strategist and has acted as their spokesman. He claims to be a physicist with a particular interest in the study of entropy.\n\nAshmawi, who is from Surrey, says on his website: 'Sup, hi, hello, I'm a little bit of a weird one. I work on physics a lot of the time, with particular interest in a quantity called entropy.'\n\nHe certainly appears to be something of a globe-trotter, which may be at odds with his climate concerns.\n\nA political splinter group with links to XR and Just Stop Oil, called People Demand Democracy, claimed responsibility for the incident, saying they are a 'new group calling for an upgrade to the UK political system using civil disobedience'.\n\nAfter being showered in glitter, Sir Keir was cheered as he took off his jacket and continued after the man was removed saying: 'If he thinks that bothers me he doesn't know me.'\n\nThe incident raises questions about the Labour leader's personal protection and security at the conference on Merseyside."
