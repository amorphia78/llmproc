Only Australia had a higher rate at one in five protests.\n\nThe research comes amid an outcry over the targeting of climate and environmental protesters, with a rise in the suppression of dissent around the world as the climate, biodiversity and pollution crises take hold.\n\n\"There is an increasing criminalisation and repression of climate and environmental protest,\" said Oscar Berglund, a political economist at the University of Bristol who led the study. \"These kinds of protests have increased, climate protests quite sharply, and the response to this has been a crackdown that has to be seen in the wider political sense of a breakdown in climate action.\"\n\nMichel Forst, the UN special rapporteur for environmental defenders, said earlier this year: \"In many countries, the state response to peaceful environmental protest is increasingly to repress rather than to enable and protect those seeking to speak up for the environment.\"\n\nBerglund and his colleagues looked at data collected by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data database between 2012 and 2023. The data showed a particularly sharp rise in the number of climate protests towards the end of the 2010s, coinciding with the growth of the youth-led Fridays for Future movement and groups such as Extinction Rebellion in the UK.\n\nThe researchers found that new laws in the UK had created new offences, increased sentence lengths for non-violent protest and minor acts of sabotage, and given police new powers to stop protests. The UK's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2021 and the Public Order Act 2022 transformed the relationship between protesters and the state, handing police extensive new powers to curtail protests and criminalising a range of protest activities."
