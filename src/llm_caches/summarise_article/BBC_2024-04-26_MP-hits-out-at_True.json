  "string_data": "PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil protesters (women aged 40s and 60s) targeted Conservative MP Mark Jenkinson's constituency office in Maryport, covering windows with \"Stop Tory Coal\" posters and causing damage with adhesive. The protest opposed plans for a new coal mine in West Cumbria. Both women were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. The protesters demanded stopping the coal mine, arguing it undermines climate targets and that the British steel industry doesn't want the coking coal.\n\nSECONDARY: No secondary protests mentioned.\n\nOTHER FOCAL: The article focuses heavily on the heated exchange between MP Jenkinson, who called protesters \"spoilt, middle-class climate clowns\" and \"entitled morons,\" and Just Stop Oil's response calling his comments \"adolescent.\"\n\nTONE: The article maintains a neutral tone, presenting both the MP's harsh criticism and the protesters' justifications equally."
