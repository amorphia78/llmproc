However, the destruction they left in their wake delayed the thrilling end to the tournament.\n\nTour officials were called to the green where groundskeepers waited with leaf blowers ready to be called into action.\n\nSome of the intruders wore t-shirts with the message 'No Golf On A Dead Planet' emblazoned across the front.\n\nPolice handcuffed at least five people, according to CBS play-by-play man Jim Nantz.\n\nExtinction Rebellion released a statement shortly after Sunday's protests at the Travelers Championship, insisting they were aiming to highlight the 'worldwide danger of climate breakdown'.\n\n'With this action, Extinction Rebellion is NOT protesting any individual or organization,' the statement reads. 'Rather, the protest highlights the worldwide danger of climate breakdown.\n\n'Case in point: the last 13 months were the hottest on record, with extreme weather events around the globe. The activists pointed out that natural disasters are already causing large-scale loss of human, animal, and plant life, as well as significant damage to infrastructure, property, and agriculture.'"
