They say data from their latest expedition will be used in an application to begin mining in the area in 2025.\n\nBut opponents of deep sea mining, among them two dozen governments, including Mexico, say too little is known about its potential environmental impacts to go ahead safely, and have called for a moratorium on any licensing.\n\nGreenpeace activists from Mexico, Argentina, Norway, South Korea, Poland and the UK have been protesting against the Coco since 23 November, carrying out sorties in canoes launched from the Arctic Sunrise, a Greenpeace ship, to stop the Coco's crew from deploying equipment.\n\nThe Metals Company sought an injunction in the Netherlands to force protesters to stay 500 metres from the Coco. But in a summary ruling, Amsterdam district court said protests could continue around the ship.\n\nGreenpeace called the ruling \"a massive setback for the deep sea mining industry\". \"We are determined to keep bringing this dangerous industry to public attention and will continue to disrupt this dangerous industry,\" said Mads Christensen, head of Greenpeace International.\n\nGerard Barron, executive chair of The Metals Company, said the company would \"continue to gather the important scientific data\" for members of the International Seabed Authority."
