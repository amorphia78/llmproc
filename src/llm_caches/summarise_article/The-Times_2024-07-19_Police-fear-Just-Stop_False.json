I do hope it does have some deterrent effect. But for some, it might be a rallying call.\"\n\nThe five Just Stop Oil activists were recorded by an undercover reporter for The Sun during a Zoom call in which they discussed the planned protests and were aiming to recruit others.\n\nRudd said the protesters were known to police before the covert recording. \"The call contained compelling evidence of them engaging in a plan to conduct what is criminal activity. They wanted to cause absolute gridlock and chaos.\"\n\nThe court was told that the M25 protests delayed more than 700,000 vehicles and caused economic damage of £765,000, and the cost to the Met was more than £1.1 million.\n\nLord Falconer of Thoroton, the former justice secretary, said the sentences make him feel \"very uncomfortable,\" noting \"these are people who are not violent criminals.\""
