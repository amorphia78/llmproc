She told a judge she did it for the future of her grandchildren.\n\nMs Delap, 76, is one of 12 Stop Oil protesters accused of breaching a court injunction aimed at restricting protest and disruption on the motorway. Several junctions across Surrey, London, Essex and Kent were affected by the Just Stop Oil action.\n\nMr Justice Soole is overseeing a hearing at the High Court in London which is expected to end later this week. She told the judge on Tuesday a policeman had greeted her with \"some surprise\".\n\nMs Delap, a mother of two, said she had been given climbing training by a Just Stop Oil mentor before taking part in the protest. Lawyers representing National Highways said protesters caused \"considerable delays\" and were in contempt of court.\n\nMs Delap said she was unaware that an injunction was in place and apologised. She told the judge she had joined the protest after Just Stop Oil called for volunteers.\n\n\"I heard a Just Stop Oil Zoom call for climbers to volunteer,\" Ms Delap said. \"I thought, well, I am 76, I have never had any climbing experience, I didn't think I had to volunteer for that. But it went onto my mind and stayed there.\"\n\nMs Delap said she had climbed a ladder and sat on the gantry. \"Why did I do it? My heart is breaking for the future of my six grandchildren and all future generations.\"\n\nShe told the judge that Just Stop Oil wanted the government to \"stop new oil and gas\" and said \"the climate emergency is a serious issue and it has not been taken seriously enough\"."
