  "string_data": "PRIMARY: Five Just Stop Oil activists were found guilty of conspiring to cause public nuisance by organizing protests that blocked traffic on London's M25 motorway in November 2022. The protesters climbed gantries over the motorway, causing four days of disruption with an estimated economic loss of £750,000 and £1m in police costs. The defendants demanded action on climate change, arguing their actions were justified to raise alarm about government and business culpability for climate breakdown.\n\nSECONDARY: During the trial, 11 people were arrested for protesting outside Southwark crown court with signs about jurors' rights, and over 80 protesters gathered outside court on the final day with placards.\n\nOTHER FOCAL: The trial became chaotic with defendants repeatedly arrested for contempt of court. The judge ruled that climate change evidence was irrelevant to their defense, preventing presentation of a 250-page climate evidence bundle.\n\nTONE: The article maintains a neutral tone, factually reporting both the prosecution's case and the defendants' climate justifications."
