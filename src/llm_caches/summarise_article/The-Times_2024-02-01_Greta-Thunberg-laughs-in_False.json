If found guilty they face fines of up to £2,500.\n\nThe court heard how she had been given a \"final warning\" by police to move to a designated protest area before being arrested outside the InterContinental Hotel in Mayfair on October 17.\n\nLuke Staton, prosecuting, said leaders from the energy, finance and business worlds were present at the Energy Intelligence Forum, whose \"stated aim\" was to develop \"sustainable solutions to the world's energy challenges\", prompting laughter from Thunberg and the other defendants. Critics have dubbed the event the \"oily money conference\".\n\nThe court heard that protesters started to gather at around 7.30am and police engaged with them about improving access for about 1,000 people inside the hotel, which had been made \"impossible\".\n\nStaton said some protesters gained access to the roof just before 10.30am and \"were slowly abseiling down the side of the building\".\n\nSuperintendent Matthew Cox said a group of around ten drummers were generating \"quite a deafening noise\" and that other protesters were letting off smoke flares.\n\nAt 12.30pm he decided to impose a section 14 condition, which dictated that the protest could continue but on the pavement to the south of the hotel.\n\nThunberg was standing outside the hotel entrance when given a \"final warning\" but \"said that she was staying where she was and so she was arrested,\" Staton said."
