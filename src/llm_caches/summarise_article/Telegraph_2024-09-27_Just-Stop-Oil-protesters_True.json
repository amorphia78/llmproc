  "string_data": "PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil activists, Anna Holland and Phoebe Plummer (both 22), threw tinned tomato soup over Van Gogh's Sunflowers painting at a gallery. While the painting wasn't harmed, the soup damaged the 17th-century gold frame. They were sentenced to 20 months and 2 years respectively. Their demands focused on climate action, questioning whether art is \"worth more than life\" and linking the cost of living crisis to oil dependency.\n\nSECONDARY: Plummer received an additional three-month sentence for participating in a slow march that caused traffic disruption in west London in November 2023.\n\nOTHER FOCAL: The judge emphasized the potential for serious damage to the masterpiece and criticized the activists' disregard for the artwork's safety.\n\nTONE: The article maintains a neutral, factual tone while reporting the sentencing and court proceedings."
