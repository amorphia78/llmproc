  "string_data": "PRIMARY: Two Just Stop Oil activists sprayed orange powder paint on at least three ancient stones at Stonehenge using fire extinguishers before sitting cross-legged. The protesters were Rajan Naidu (73, from Birmingham, understood to be a Quaker) and Niamh Lynch (21, Oxford student). They demanded ending the fossil-fuel era, with Lynch stating climate policy shouldn't stand \"inert for generations\" like stones.\n\nSECONDARY: The article mentions JSO's previous \"extremist road-blocking tactics\" but doesn't detail specific secondary actions.\n\nOTHER FOCAL: The article focuses heavily on political fallout, particularly Rishi Sunak challenging Labour donor Dale Vince who previously funded JSO, and accusations that Labour's energy policy was influenced by the group's tactics.\n\nTONE: The article is strongly negative toward the protest, using terms like \"eco-fanatics,\" \"vandalism,\" \"extremist,\" and \"pathetic\" throughout."
