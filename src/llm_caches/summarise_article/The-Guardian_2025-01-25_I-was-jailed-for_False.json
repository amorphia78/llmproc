Six months into my incarceration, this is what I have learned.\n\nLocked in a tiny metal box in a prison transport van rattling its way to HMP Bronzefield, in Middlesex, I felt at peace. I was on trial with four other Just Stop Oil protesters over the group's non-violent direct action on the M25 motorway in 2022. The judge had told the jury to ignore evidence of the climate emergency, and we were not allowed to talk in depth about the climate breakdown when defending our actions. But we do not have the time to pretend the existential threat we face is not real. I had been acting out of love to bring attention to the threat to humanity and hold the government to account.\n\nSentencing day was tense. In his statement, the judge accused us of being fanatics who don't care about the rights of our fellow citizens. The judge had suggested we would be in prison for a long time, but that still didn't prepare us for our sentences. Four of us were handed four-year terms for conspiracy to cause public nuisance, while the Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam got five. They were the longest sentences ever given to non-violent protesters in the UK. A UN rapporteur had attended our trial and said our sentences were \"not acceptable in a democracy\".\n\nAt 58, I have three adult children who were supportive. Even so, the atmosphere felt very heavy. Signs like these make me hope that change is coming. But in the meantime, I had to return to HMP Bronzefield.\n\nThe contrast between our sentences and those given to violent rioters feels grim and stark. Later, those arrested for violent assault and arson during the racially motivated hate riots were sentenced to an average of two years. Fellow prisoners tell me they are shocked by the discrepancy.\n\nMy time in prison has shown me that prisoners are parents, children, friends, with hopes and dreams. Most prisoners want to rebuild their lives; they just need support to do so. We need to transition to a system focused on rehabilitation rather than punishment."
