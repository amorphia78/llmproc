FoE said it would argue the sentences breach human rights legislation.\n\nThe group also called for \"proportionate\" penalties for protesters.\n\nThe five protesters were convicted by a jury at Southwark Crown Court of conspiracy to intentionally cause a public nuisance. The protests saw about 45 protesters climb onto gantries over the motorway for four successive days, at times bringing the motorway to a standstill.\n\nProsecution barristers told the court this led to 50,000 hours of vehicle delay, an economic hit of at least £765,000, and cost the Metropolitan Police more than £1.1m.\n\nKatie de Kauwe, senior lawyer at FoE said the sentences showed \"the chilling effect of the previous government's anti-protest laws\". \"In what functioning democracy can it be right for those peacefully raising the alarm about the climate crisis to receive longer jail sentences than people who participated in racially motivated violence this summer, and deliberately targeted migrants, refugees and Muslim communities? Peaceful protesters shouldn't be locked up, period.\"\n\nJack Robirosa, legal counsel for Greenpeace UK, said the last government's \"draconian laws\" led to a situation where \"conscientious people are getting five years in prison for discussing a planned peaceful protest\". He added: \"This is not the sort of thing most people associate with an established democracy with respect for civil rights and a healthy culture of protest and free speech.\"\n\nThe appeal bids are due to be heard at the end of January."
