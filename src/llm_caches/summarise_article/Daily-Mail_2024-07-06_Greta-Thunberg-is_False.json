Whether it concerns asylum and migration, housing or protecting the rights of marginalised groups.'\n\nToday's protest comes after it was revealed that climate activists in the US and Europe are planning a summer of stunts with demonstrations at airports, banks and the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nBut Extinction Rebellion, once notorious for shutting down bridges over the Thames River in London, have shifted their main focus from mass civil disobedience to building an inclusive grassroots movement.\n\nGail Bradbrook, XR's co-founder, told AFP their new-look approach to climate activism strived 'to reach more mainstream folks' and do 'the deeper work of local organising'.\n\nBut Gabriella Ditton, a spokesperson for the group, said the arrests hadn't deterred them. 'While we face the massive crisis that we are in, we can't stop,' she told AFP."
