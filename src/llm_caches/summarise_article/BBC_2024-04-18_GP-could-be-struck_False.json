The climate crisis is the most significant existential threat to global health we have ever faced.\"\n\nDr Benn said she did not take the protests and disruptions she had participated in lightly but said people \"must be clear about the magnitude of the crisis we face\".\n\n\"I will continue carrying out what I believe is my responsibility as long as the government refuses to commit to stopping oil and gas.\""
