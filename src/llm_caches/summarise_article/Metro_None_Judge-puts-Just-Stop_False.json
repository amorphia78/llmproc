If you have to miss out on things, you have to miss out on things.\"\n\nThe estimated cost to the theatre of cancelling the performance was £80,000, the court heard.\n\nThe judge said that they could be liable to pay the full amount if they are found guilty.\n\nA group of activists disrupted the long-running theatre show during a rendition of the song, One Day More, which sees a performer waving a red flag.\n\nThey unfurled their trademark orange Just Stop Oil flag instead – to be met by boos by furious audience members.\n\nThe protesters then chained themselves to the stage with bicycle locks – prompting the cast to be forced backstage while the audience was ushered outside.\n\nThe protest was part of Just Stop Oil's attempt to raise awareness of the climate crisis and stop fossil fuel use."
