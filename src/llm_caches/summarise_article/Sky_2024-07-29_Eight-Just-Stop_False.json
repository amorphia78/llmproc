Seven Just Stop Oil activists were seen sitting on the floor inside the airport with their hands inside of lock-on devices.\n\nA London Gatwick spokesperson said at around 9.15am that the airport \"is open and operating normally today\", adding: \"There are a small number of protestors at the airport who have now been arrested and are being removed from the airport.\"\n\nIn a statement, Sussex Police said eight people were arrested on suspicion of interfering with public infrastructure, and added \"a heightened police presence should be expected at this time\".\n\nVideo posted by Just Stop Oil also shows travellers walking over the activists, whose hands were seen inside the lock-on devices.\n\n\"As long as political leaders fail to take swift and decisive action to protect our communities from the worst effects of climate breakdown, Just Stop Oil supporters, working with other groups internationally, will take the proportionate action necessary to generate much needed political pressure,\" the group said in a statement.\n\n\"This summer, areas of key importance to the fossil fuel economy will be declared sites of civil resistance around the world.\"\n\nThe group added the protest at Gatwick comes as part of the international campaign Oil Kills, and said 21 groups across 12 countries have demonstrated at 17 airports so far.\n\nJust Stop Oil said the international campaign follows reports that the world saw its hottest days on record two days in a row last week."
