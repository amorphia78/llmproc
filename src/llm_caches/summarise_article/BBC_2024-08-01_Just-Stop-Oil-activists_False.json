  "string_data": "Five environmental activists who aimed to \"create mass disruption\" have been jailed for their role in protests that caused widespread traffic disruption on the M25.\n\nThe Just Stop Oil campaigners climbed gantries on the motorway in November 2022, forcing police to stop the traffic, in an attempt to cause gridlock across southern England. People \"suffered hours of delay\" on 9 November 2022 as a result, Basildon Crown Court heard.\n\nAll the defendants, who pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to causing a public nuisance, received terms of between one year eight months and two years. The defendants were all either retired, students or recent graduates at the time, the court heard.\n\nJudge Shane Collery KC noted that an accident happened near one gantry and it was \"fortunate more accidents did not occur\". \"It's easy to be blasé and dismissive when it's not your life that's being disrupted,\" he said. He said the protesters \"considered you knew better than everyone else\", and suggested an element may have been \"the day out and perhaps the excitement of a day's action\".\n\nProtests over four successive days in November 2022 closed parts of the motorway in Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire. The judge said the court \"accepts a conscientious motive may be a relevant consideration\". However he said \"your actions were disproportionate to your aims\".\n\nHe jailed George Simonson, 24, of Leeds, and 26-year-old Theresa Higginson of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, for two years. Paul Bell, 24, of Exeter, was jailed for one year and 10 months. Gaie Delap, 77, of Bristol, and Paul Sousek, 73, of Bude in Cornwall were jailed for one year and eight months. A sixth defendant, Daniel Johnson, 25, of Perth and Kinross in Scotland, was given a 21-month prison sentence, suspended for two years."
