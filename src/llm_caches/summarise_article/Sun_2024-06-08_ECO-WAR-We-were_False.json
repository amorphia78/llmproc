A helicopter carrying heavily armed and balaclava-clad Russian solders was attempting to land on their ship and they knew they were in serious danger.\n\n27-year-old Brit Alexandra Harris from Exeter found herself at the centre of the drama on her first protest for Greenpeace. She said: \"It's like finding yourself in the middle of a James Bond movie. I was terrified. I've never had a gun pointed at me before.\"\n\nFor Brit Frank Hewetson, storming an oil rig in the middle of the sea was nothing new. The 58-year-old is banned from entering America and Greenland after staging multiple protests for Greenpeace against oil companies around the globe. He said: \"It was an incredibly daring mission. It needed to be done.\"\n\nThe jailed activists saw their charges reduced from piracy to hooliganism and after just over two months behind bars, they were all freed."
