  "string_data": "check failed - There is a factual inconsistency in the article. The text states that Decker is serving \"two years and seven months\" for the protest, but later says \"the 14 months he has already spent in prison.\" These numbers don't align logically - if he's serving a sentence of two years and seven months (31 months total), and has already spent 14 months in prison, he would still have 17 months remaining, but the article doesn't clarify this timeline or explain the discrepancy between the sentence length and time served."
