  "string_data": "check failed - The article contains an incomplete quote from activist Cole Macdonald that ends abruptly mid-sentence without proper closure or attribution continuation. The quote begins with \"We're living in two worlds...\" but cuts off after \"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'.\" and then continues with another quote \"Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\" without clear indication of whether this is still the same speaker or proper quote formatting."
