  "string_data": "check failed - The article contains a non-sequitur issue with the third image caption. The caption reads \"The video posted on social media shows Plummer posting the letter with a friend. It then cuts to show several police officers asking if she has ID. Pictured climbing into a police van\" - this caption appears to be describing multiple scenes from the video but is attached to a single image that only shows her climbing into the police van. This suggests content removal has damaged the coherence between the images and their captions."
