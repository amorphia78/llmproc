  "string_data": "check failed - The article contains a factual inconsistency regarding the criminal damage charge. The text states \"Bruce and Parfitt were both arrested and charged with £2,000 in criminal damage\" but this phrasing is incorrect - people are not \"charged with £2,000\" but rather charged with criminal damage that caused £2,000 worth of damage. The correct phrasing would be something like \"charged with criminal damage estimated at £2,000\" or \"charged with causing £2,000 worth of criminal damage.\""
