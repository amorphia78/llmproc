  "string_data": "check failed - There is a gender inconsistency in the article. Cole Macdonald is referred to as both male (using \"Cole Macdonald\" which is typically a male name) and female. The article states \"Essex Police have now said that two women, aged 22 and 28, have been arrested\" but earlier identifies Cole Macdonald as one of the two activists, and Ms Macdonald is said to be 22 from Brighton. This suggests Cole Macdonald is being treated as female, but the name Cole is typically male, creating confusion about the person's gender identity that would likely be clarified in a professional news article."
