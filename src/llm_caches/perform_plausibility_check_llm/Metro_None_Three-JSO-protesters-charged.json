  "string_data": "check failed - There are several issues with this article that damage its plausibility:\n\n1. The timeline is confusing and contradictory. The article states that three activists were charged \"today\" after throwing soup \"yesterday,\" but then says they were charged after Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland were \"jailed hours before the second souping.\" This creates a nonsensical sequence of events.\n\n2. The second image caption identifies \"Phoebe Plummer (L) and Anna Holland (R)\" but the image alt text describes protesters in JSO t-shirts, while the caption mentions they were \"jailed for vandalising Van Gogh's Sunflowers painting\" - this doesn't match the context of the new incident being described.\n\n3. The article jumps between describing the recent incident (with Stephen Simpson, Phillipa Green, and Mary Somerville) and the 2022 incident (with Plummer and Holland) without clear transitions, creating confusion about which event is being discussed.\n\n4. The phrase \"while the protesters were still attached to the wall\" appears to be missing context - it's unclear what this means or how protesters would be \"attached to the wall.\""
