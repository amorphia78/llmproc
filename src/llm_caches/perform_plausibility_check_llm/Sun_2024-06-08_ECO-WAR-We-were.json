  "string_data": "check failed - The article contains several plausibility issues: (1) The headline mentions \"new BBC documentary\" but the article body never mentions BBC again or provides any details about this documentary, creating a non-sequitur; (2) There's an inconsistency in Frank Hewetson's age - he's described as both 58 years old in two different paragraphs, but given the 2013 events and current 2024 date, this repetition suggests editing issues; (3) The article abruptly ends without proper conclusion or any reference back to the BBC documentary mentioned in the headline, suggesting content may have been removed inappropriately."
