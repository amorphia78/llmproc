  "string_data": "check failed - The article contains extremely crude and inappropriate content that would not be published by a mainstream UK news outlet like Metro. The headline and content describing someone defecating in a politician's garden, along with the vulgar language and explicit descriptions, would violate editorial standards. Additionally, the tone and presentation treat this criminal act (trespassing and vandalism) in a sensationalized way that lacks the professional journalistic approach expected from legitimate news media. The quotes and framing suggest this is more like activist propaganda than credible news reporting."
