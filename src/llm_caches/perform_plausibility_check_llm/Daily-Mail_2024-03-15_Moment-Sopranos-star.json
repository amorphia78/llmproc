  "string_data": "check failed - There is a factual error in the caption of the second image. The caption states that Michael Imperioli \"plays Christopher Moltisanti in the show Sopranos\" but this uses present tense when it should use past tense, as The Sopranos ended in 2007. It should read \"played Christopher Moltisanti\" or \"who played Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos.\""
