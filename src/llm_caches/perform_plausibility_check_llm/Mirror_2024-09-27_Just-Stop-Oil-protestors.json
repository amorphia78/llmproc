  "string_data": "check failed - The article contains a non-sequitur and factual inconsistency. The National Gallery statement says the paintings \"are unharmed,\" but the final paragraph claims that a previous similar protest \"caused up to £10,000 worth of damage to a Van Gogh painting's gold frame.\" This creates confusion about whether these protests actually damage the artworks or not, and the transition between discussing the current incident and the 2022 incident is abrupt and poorly connected."
