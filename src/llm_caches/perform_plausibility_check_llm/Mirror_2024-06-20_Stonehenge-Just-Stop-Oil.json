  "string_data": "check failed - The article contains a factual inconsistency in the first paragraph where it states the protesters sprayed \"orange-coloured corn and paint flour\" which is nonsensical - it should likely be \"orange-coloured powder\" or \"corn flour and paint\" but not \"corn and paint flour.\" Additionally, there's a contradiction between the first paragraph describing the substance as \"corn and paint flour\" and later references to \"orange powder\" and \"orange substance,\" creating confusion about what was actually used in the protest."
