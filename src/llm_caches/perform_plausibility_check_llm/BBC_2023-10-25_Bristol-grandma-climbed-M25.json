  "string_data": "check failed - There is a pronoun reference error in the fourth paragraph. The sentence \"Mr Justice Soole is overseeing a hearing at the High Court in London which is expected to end later this week. She told the judge on Tuesday a policeman had greeted her with 'some surprise'.\" incorrectly uses \"She\" to refer to Ms Delap immediately after introducing Mr Justice Soole, creating confusion about who is speaking. This appears to be a result of content removal that damaged the flow and clarity of the text."
