  "string_data": "check failed - There is a significant discrepancy between the image alt text and the article content. The alt text describes a banner reading \"JUST STOP OIL IS A GLORIOUS SHIPWRECK\" while the article text states the sign said \"over 1.5 degrees is a global shipwreck\". These are completely different messages, making the image inconsistent with the reported facts in the article body."
