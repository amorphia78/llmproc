  "string_data": "check failed - There are several factual inconsistencies and errors that damage plausibility. The article states Roger Hallam received a \"four-year sentence\" in the main text but then mentions \"IMPRISONED FOR 5 YEARS\" in the image caption, creating a contradiction. Additionally, the article appears to be written in 2025 (based on image URLs showing \"2025/04/\") but refers to events as if they just happened, when Just Stop Oil's major activities and the sentences mentioned occurred in 2022-2024. The timeline doesn't align properly for a mainstream news article."
