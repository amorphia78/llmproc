  "string_data": "check failed - There are inconsistencies in the duration the protesters were on the bridge. The article states they \"scaled the bridge for almost 40 hours\" in the second paragraph, but later says \"The activists were on the bridge for about 37 hours\" in the final image caption. Additionally, there's an inconsistency in the image captions - the first caption shows \"(l-r) Marcus Decker and Morgan Trowland\" but the second caption also shows \"(l-r) Marcus Decker and Morgan Trowland\" when the alt text descriptions suggest different individuals in different order or context."
