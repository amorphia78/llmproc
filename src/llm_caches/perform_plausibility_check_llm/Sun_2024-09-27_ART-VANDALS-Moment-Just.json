  "string_data": "check failed - The article contains several inconsistencies and unclear references. It begins by stating that activists threw soup over Van Gogh's painting \"today\" after two others were jailed, but then shifts to describing the 2022 incident by Plummer and Holland without clearly distinguishing between the current incident and the past one. The article mentions \"three eco-idiots targeted the masterpiece\" but then describes only two people (Plummer and Holland) from the 2022 incident. The timeline is confusing - it's unclear whether the soup-throwing described in the images happened today or refers to the 2022 incident. The article lacks clear attribution for the current incident and fails to properly separate the reporting of today's events from the background information about the 2022 case and sentencing."
