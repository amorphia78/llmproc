  "string_data": "check failed - There is a significant inconsistency in the article regarding what substance was used. The English Heritage spokeswoman is quoted as saying \"Orange powdered paint has been thrown at a number of the stones\" while Just Stop Oil's statement claims they \"used orange cornflour paint to spray onto the stones.\" Additionally, the headline and early text refer to \"spray paint\" while later the article mentions both \"powdered paint\" and \"cornflour paint.\" This creates confusion about the actual nature of the substance used and appears to be a result of incomplete editing during the article processing."
