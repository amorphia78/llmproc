  "string_data": "check failed - There is a significant inconsistency in the article. The headline and opening paragraph claim that 50 Barclays branches were forced to close, but the article then only mentions three specific locations (Tottenham Court Road in London, Kilmarnock Road in Glasgow and Albion Street in Leeds). This creates a major discrepancy between the claimed scale of the action (50 branches) and the evidence provided (3 specific locations), which would be implausible in a mainstream news article that would need to substantiate such a significant claim."
