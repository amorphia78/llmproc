  "string_data": "check failed - The article contains inappropriately unattributed quotes and lacks proper sourcing. The detailed quotes from Phoebe Plummer's speech appear to be presented as direct quotes but there's no indication of when, where, or how these quotes were obtained. The article mentions \"a meeting attended by some 50 hardcore activists\" and describes Plummer's \"shouty speech\" but provides no attribution for how the reporter gained access to this information or these quotes. This level of detailed quotation without proper sourcing attribution would not meet mainstream UK news media standards."
