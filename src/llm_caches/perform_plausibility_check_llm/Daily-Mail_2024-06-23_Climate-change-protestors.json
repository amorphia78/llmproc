  "string_data": "check failed - There is a factual inconsistency regarding the identity of the golfer. The article states that \"Tom Kim stood on the final green with a chance to force a playoff against World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler\" but then the image caption identifies \"Scottie Scheffler (right)\" as the golfer in white walking on the green. This creates confusion about which golfer is actually shown in the image and contradicts the earlier statement about Tom Kim being the one positioned to take the crucial putt."
