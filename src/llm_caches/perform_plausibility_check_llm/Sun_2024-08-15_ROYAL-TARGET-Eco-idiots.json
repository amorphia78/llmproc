  "string_data": "check failed - The article contains several plausibility issues: (1) The inflammatory language like \"eco idiots\" and \"eco rabble\" is unusually extreme even for The Sun's typical tone; (2) There's a logical inconsistency where the article states protesters plan to \"storm\" and \"break into\" castle grounds but later describes it as \"non-violent action\"; (3) The final caption states \"The King will not even be at Windsor Castle during the protest because he will be spending his summer holiday at Balmoral in Scotland\" but this information is not mentioned anywhere in the body text, creating a non-sequitur; (4) The sourcing is vague, relying heavily on unnamed \"reports,\" \"investigators,\" and \"risk assessments\" without proper attribution that would be expected in legitimate journalism."
