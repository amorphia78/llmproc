  "string_data": "check failed - There is a discrepancy between the image description and caption for the first image. The alt text describes \"A person sits on the grass in front of the vandalized building\" but the caption states \"A protester at King's College Cambridge sprayed paint on a building using a fire extinguisher.\" However, the article text indicates that Chiara Sarti was the protester who used a fire extinguisher at King's College Cambridge, while Sam Holland was the protester at University of Leeds who was \"filmed 'redecorating orange' the Great Hall.\" The image appears to be mislabeled as being from Cambridge when it may actually be from Leeds, creating confusion about which protest incident the image depicts."
