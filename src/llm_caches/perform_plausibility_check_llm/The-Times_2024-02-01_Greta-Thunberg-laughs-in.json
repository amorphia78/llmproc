  "string_data": "check failed - The third image and its caption \"Like Greta but wetter: the sewage activist striking for Windermere\" appears completely unrelated to the article content. The article is about Greta Thunberg's trial for protesting at an oil executives' meeting in London, but this image shows someone by water with what appears to be a measuring stick, and the caption refers to sewage activism at Windermere. This suggests content was removed that would have made this image relevant, or the image was incorrectly retained during processing."
