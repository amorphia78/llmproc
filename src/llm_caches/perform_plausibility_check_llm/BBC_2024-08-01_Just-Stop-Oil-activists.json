  "string_data": "check failed - The image shows a collapsed gantry structure that has fallen across the highway, but the article describes protesters climbing gantries to cause traffic disruption, not gantries collapsing. The image caption states \"Mass disruption was caused by Just Stop Oil protesters in November 2022\" but the visual content shows structural collapse rather than protest activity, creating a misleading impression that doesn't match the described protest method."
