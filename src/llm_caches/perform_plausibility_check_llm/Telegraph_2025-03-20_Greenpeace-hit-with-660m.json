  "string_data": "check failed - The article contains a factual impossibility with the date. The article is dated March 20, 2025 (a future date that hasn't occurred yet), but discusses events from 2016-2017 and presents a jury verdict as having happened \"Wednesday\" as if it were current news. This creates a temporal inconsistency that would not appear in a legitimate mainstream UK news article."
