I am a theater artist,' the rebel shouted before being escorted offstage by security.The protestor continued: 'The oceans are rising. It will swallow this city and this entire theater whole. I am putting my career on the line because we are not doing anything about this crisis. The water is coming for us!' #ME #DE\n#PH #CS Michael Imperioli (left), who plays Christopher Moltisanti in the show Sopranos, told the protestors to 'go back to drama school' (Alt: The image shows two men in business suits standing close together indoors.
