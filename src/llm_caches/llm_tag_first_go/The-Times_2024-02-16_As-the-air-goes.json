The timestamp indicates 12:02:2024 22:45:51 GMT. Multiple vehicles are visible along the street, with individuals appearing to be working near the cars' wheels. The scene takes place on a typical London residential street with Victorian-style terraced houses visible in the background.) #CE\nThe group, which launched in 2021, is a decentralised movement, with instructions on how to deflate a tyre with something as small as a lentil available on their website along with leaflets to be placed on people's cars to explain the action.CCTV obtained by The Times showed three men wearing baseball caps tinkering with tyre valves in Sands End on Monday night, with the whole operation lasting just under a minute for each car. #DE #NS \"It's so bad. They said that they'd keep doing it unless you change your vehicle,\" Knowles said. \"I'm looking out the window at night just to see if they're outside. I don't want anyone near my vehicle. They don't know why people need a vehicle.\" #NE #DS Knowles did not display her badge when she parks at home because she has a residency permit, leaving her a target in the eyes of the Tyre Extinguishers, who claim to not target mobility vehicles if they see a disabled badge. #DE\n\n#DS #PH #CS The Tyre Extinguishers left notes trying to justify the vandalism (Alt: A white paper notice is placed under a car's windshield wiper on a wet windshield.
