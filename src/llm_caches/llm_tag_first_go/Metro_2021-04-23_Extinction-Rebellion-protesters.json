They argued it was a 'necessary' and 'proportionate' response to the harm being caused. #ME #MS One of the defendants, Senan Clifford, quoted Sir David Attenborough and former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams in his evidence. He stated, \"I believe if I don't do whatever I can to protect our Earth, to protect life on this Earth, to stop the death and injury that is and will be happening, I'm committing a crime, a really serious crime, and I'm willing to break a window, to paint a message on a wall, I'm willing to break the glass on that emergency button, even if some say that's a crime.\" #ME\n#GS #PH #CS Demonstrators surround the Shell Centre in London in April 2019 (Picture: AFP via Getty) #CE #GE\n#NS Judge Gregory Perrins directed jurors that even if they thought the protesters were 'morally justified' it did not provide them with a lawful excuse to commit criminal damage. #NE #ES However, the jury of seven women and five men took seven hours and four minutes to acquit them of both charges.The protesters, including two of Extinction Rebellion's co-founders, were jubilant as they left court. #EE #MS One of them, Simon Bramwell, called it \"a significant victory for the consciousness of the British people when it comes to the huge, immediate threat of climate change and the absolute failure of our Government to do anything meaningful about it.\" #ME\n#ES #PH #CS The jury took seven hours and four minutes to acquit them of both charges (Picture: PA) #CE #EE"
