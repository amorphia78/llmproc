Protesters erected a 13ft-high pink table at a junction near Leicester Square Tube station #ME #MS with \"Come To The Table\" written on it. #ME #GS It is the first site to be blockaded and occupied by the group this year, reminiscent of the pink boat that protesters erected at Oxford Circus during demonstrations in April 2019. Protesters quickly climbed on top of the table, which is equipped with sleeping quarters and areas where they can lock themselves in. Others lay on the ground with their arms encased in a suitcase packed with concrete, as a means of preventing police from dispersing the protest. #GE #GS The climate change activists claimed last week that thousands would take part in what it said would be two weeks of protests mainly targeting the City of London. Police officers lined Whitehall, guarding the entrances to government departments. Territorial Support Group vans were also on hand. #GE\n\n#MS Gail Bradbrook, co-founder of XR, told the crowd, \"This is not a protest, it's a rebellion. The social contract between the people and the state is broken. We are in an active rebellion against the British government.\" #ME\n\n#GS The Metropolitan Police said a \"significant\" operation would be put in place to manage the protests over the busy bank holiday weekend #GE #PS but acknowledged the activists' \"important cause.\" #PE #NS Matt Twist, deputy assistant commissioner, warned that the protests would impact policing in communities across London and hinder efforts to deal with issues such as knife crime, domestic abuse, and violence. #NE\n\n#PS The movement has gained support from celebrities such as the comedian and author Stephen Fry and actor Jerome Flynn. Flynn said it was \"more urgent than ever\" for people to take a stand against life-destructive systems. #PE"
