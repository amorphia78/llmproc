The activists, identified as Eben Lazarus, 22, a music student, and Hannah Hunt, 23, a psychology student, both from Brighton, attached their own image of an \"apocalyptic vision of the future\" to the painting.The protesters' alternative image featured an old car dumped in front of the mill, two aeroplanes, and a washing machine in the back of the cart, contrasting with the original rural Suffolk scene. The action forced the evacuation of visitors, including a class of 11-year-old schoolchildren, from the room where the painting hangs.Wearing matching branded t-shirts, the campaigners crossed a rope barrier and attached the printed image over the top of the painting. They then glued one hand each to the picture frame and crouched below, voicing their concerns about the climate. #GE\n#MS The protesters called for an end to new oil and gas licences in the North Sea. Hunt stated, \"I'm here because our government plans to license 40 new UK oil and gas projects in the next few years. This makes them complicit in pushing the world towards an unliveable climate and in the death of billions of people in the coming decades.\"Lazarus, who described himself as an art lover, said, \"Art is important. It should be held for future generations to see, but when there is no food what use is art? When there is no water, what use is art? When billions of people are in pain and suffering, what use then is art?\" #ME\n#GS The National Gallery reported minor damage to the frame and disruption to the surface of the varnish on the painting, both of which have been repaired. The Metropolitan Police were called to the scene at approximately 14:25. #GE"
