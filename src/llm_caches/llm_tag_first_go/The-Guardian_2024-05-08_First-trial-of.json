Just Stop Oil described it as a \"major test case\" of the new law. #NS Critics have said section 7 makes anyone walking in a road liable for prosecution for \"interference with key national infrastructure\", giving police undue discretion over when to target protesters. #NE It bans any act that prevents newspaper printing presses, power plants, oil and gas extraction or distribution sites, harbours, airports, railways or roads \"from being used or operated to any extent\", with a potential penalty of 12 months in jail.\n#DS #PH #CS Police officers arresting the Just Stop Oil activist Phoebe Plummer (shown) on 19 July 2023 after a slow march along Cromwell Road, south-west London.

I was on a march for less than 20 minutes, which I have already spent two and a half weeks in prison for, and now over a week of judges, lawyers and a jury's time has to be wasted to decide if that's a crime.\""
