She is still awaiting trial. #DE\n\n#NS After her arrest in May, she was told by the diocese of Bristol and the city's bishop, Vivienne Faull, that she would be denied permission to officiate (PTO) because of the charges she is facing. #NE\n\nPTO is a licence granted by the Church of England, typically to retired priests or deacons, that allows them to conduct religious ceremonies. It has to be renewed every three years and renewal is usually only refused for severe wrongdoing. Parfitt, who lives in Bristol, said she has been negotiating with the diocese for her PTO renewal since the start of 2023. She was subject to a safeguarding check that recommended she should be granted the permission.\n\n#DS #PH #CS A Just Stop Oil photo of Judy Bruce, a retired biology teacher from Swansea and Parfitt during a protest at the British Library in London this May.

I don't want to sound too pious, but it's part of the sacrifice I've been called to make.\" #ME\n\nParfitt said \"the biggest thing\" was that she would never be able to preside over a eucharist again. \"That is a big deal. But if it came to the point where [Faull] said to me: 'You can have your licence back if you commit to never take any illegal action again,' I wouldn't agree to that.\"\n\n#NS A spokesperson for the Bristol diocese said: \"PTO is not being issued at this time based on the fact that Ms Parfitt is facing criminal charges in ongoing court proceedings.\" #NE"
