National Highways reported two-hour delays in both directions and five to six miles of congestion. #GE #MS Climate change activist group Just Stop Oil claimed responsibility, stating that two of its supporters had scaled the 84m-high masts on the north side of the bridge \"to demand that the government halts all new oil and gas licences and consents.\" #ME #GS Essex Police confirmed the closure, saying, \"The bridge has been closed while we resolve the incident which we will do as quickly and as safely for all involved.\" They added that a diversion would be put in place through the tunnel, but warned of likely delays throughout the morning due to the complexities of safely getting people down from height. #GE\n#GS #PH #CS The protesters climbed the bridge's masts.
