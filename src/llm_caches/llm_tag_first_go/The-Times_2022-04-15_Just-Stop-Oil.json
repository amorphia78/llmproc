Just Stop Oil, which is affiliated with Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain, wants the government to stop all future licensing and consent for fossil fuel production and exploration. #ME\n#PH #CS Louis McKechnie has been at the centre of protests against the government's policies on fossil fuelsTOLGA AKMEN FOR THE TIMES #CE\n#ES The activist has been arrested 17 times and served a prison sentence over the past year for his involvement in climate protests. #EE #MS #ES He acknowledges the personal cost of his actions, saying, \"I'm throwing away my own future at the expense of everybody else's. I can't do this and study. And with a criminal record I can't get a job. I'm not going to be able to do a lot of normal life things after this.\" #EE #ME #MS Despite the criticism and personal risks, McKechnie remains committed to the cause. He believes that he and his 19-year-old sister will not \"live to have grey hair\" if government climate policy is not radically strengthened. \"I would be ok with being the most hated man in the country if it means protecting my loved ones and the future of my generation in this country and all around the world,\" he stated. #ME"
