The move comes the day before celebrations begin for the Summer Solstice at the 5,000-year-old landmark.Wiltshire Police confirmed two people had been arrested on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument. #DE Just Stop Oil said the orange powder paint was cornflour and it would \"wash away with rain\". The group named the two protesters as Niamh Lynch, a 21-year-old student from Oxford, and Rajan Naidu, a 73-year-old from Birmingham, in a statement.#NS Prime Minister Rishi Sunak condemned the incident as a \"disgraceful act of vandalism\". Leader of the Labour Party Sir Keir Starmer said the damage was \"outrageous\" and described Just Stop Oil as \"pathetic\". #NE #DS Members of the public were heard shouting \"no\" and seen running to intervene as the campaigners ran up to the stone circle at the Unesco world heritage site. #DE #NS Nick Merriman, chief executive of English Heritage, said the vandalism was \"deeply saddening\". He told the BBC's Today programme the stones are \"testament to people's desire to connect to nature\", and while he respected the rights of people to protest, he hoped they would channel their activism away from museum sites in future. #NE\n#DS #PH #CS Two protesters sprayed powder paint on Stonehenge (Alt: The image shows Stonehenge's ancient stone circle obscured by large clouds of orange powder paint.
