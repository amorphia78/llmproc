They say data from their latest expedition will be used in an application to begin mining in the area in 2025.But opponents of deep sea mining, among them two dozen governments, including Mexico, say too little is known about its potential environmental impacts to go ahead safely, and have called for a moratorium on any licensing.\n#DS #PH #CS Sailors on the Coco turn their water hoses on Greenpeace protestors.

But in a summary ruling, Amsterdam district court said protests could continue around the ship. #DE\n#PS Greenpeace called the ruling \"a massive setback for the deep sea mining industry\". #PE #MS \"We are determined to keep bringing this dangerous industry to public attention and will continue to disrupt this dangerous industry,\" said Mads Christensen, head of Greenpeace International. #ME\nGerard Barron, executive chair of The Metals Company, said the company would \"continue to gather the important scientific data\" for members of the International Seabed Authority."
