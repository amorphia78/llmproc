She used tools to break a large pane of reinforced security glass, which cost £27,660 to replace. #DE #MS During her police interview, she said she had been trying to stop crimes against humanity and \"had permission from nature\" to break the window. #ME #DS Over two trials she tried to make similar arguments despite being repeatedly directed not to do so by the judge. #DE\n#DS #PH #CS Bradbrook, pictured here causing criminal damage to the DfT window, could be jailed if she commits another crime in the next 15 months (Alt: The image shows a woman in a dark jacket using a hammer-like tool to create spider web cracks in a large glass window or door.

We are compelled to act. The court systems of the UK are on trial, not myself. I wonder how history will judge this sentencing.\" #ME #NS #DS Judge Edmunds said the damage and disruption caused by Bradbrook meant she would normally have been jailed, but suspended her prison sentence. She was also ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. #DE #NE\n#PH #CS Dr Gail Bradbrook is a high-profile member of Extinction Rebellion, whose mission statement is to create a culture that is \"healthy, resilient and adaptable\" (Alt: The image shows a woman with blonde hair wearing a light-colored knit beanie and dark jacket, standing on what appears to be a pedestrian street or plaza.
