Images from the scene show protesters on wires holding red banners displaying a number of slogans decrying Ineos' influence in the plastics industry.Greenpeace said the \"climbers\" were being supported by a rescue team on the bridge and a boat below and would remain suspended 25m (82ft) above the Firth of Forth's main shipping lane. The group has blocked the deep water shipping lane, preventing larger vessels from accessing the channel, however smaller boats are unaffected.Police Scotland said they were \"engaging\" with those involved. The bridge has been closed to private transport since 2018 following the opening of the Queensferry Crossing and is now used as a public transport corridor. #DE\n#MS #PH #CS Greenpeace accused Ineos of attempting to influence the signing of a global plastics treaty (Alt: The image shows two people suspended from ropes against a white sky, holding a large red banner that reads ) #CE\nGreenpeace has called on governments to commit to cutting global plastic production by at least 75% by 2040. Greenpeace programme director Amy Cameron said she was concerned Ineos and owner Ratcliffe would \"do everything they can to stop\" an agreement being signed.She added: \"Ratcliffe tries to distract us with sports teams and sponsorships, but we're not going to let him fill our planet with plastic, so he can fill his pockets with profit. Ratcliffe is trying to block a strong Global Plastics Treaty, so today we're blocking him.\" #ME #NS Ineos described the action by Greenpeace as \"dangerous, disruptive, and entirely counterproductive,\" adding it \"threatened skilled jobs in Scotland\". The company said unless groups like Greenpeace stop attacking companies and start supporting waste infrastructure and advanced recycling, \"they are actively contributing to the problem\" and \"standing in the way of the very solutions that are needed\". #NE\n#PH #CS Greenpeace programme director Amy Cameron said she was concerned Ineos would try and block a global plastics treaty (Alt: A woman with glasses and blonde hair pulled back wears a green jacket over a dark top, standing outdoors.
