But after jurors were directed to only take into account whether or not the protest had caused \"significant\" disruption to the roads, they found the defendants guilty in an 11-1 majority verdict.\n\nOver a five-day trial, Southwark crown court heard that on 15 November last year Plummer, Sarti and Hall took part in a slow march protest along Earls Court Road as part of the Just Stop Oil campaign, #ME #MS which calls on the government to ban new licences for oil and gas exploitation in the UK. #ME\n#PH #CS Phoebe Plummer (left) and Chiara Sarti outside Southwark crown court in London.

The maximum penalty is 12 months imprisonment, an unlimited fine or both. #DE\nEnd of article for tagging."
