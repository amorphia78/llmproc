Greenpeace members unfurled a huge \"Wanted\" banner calling its chief executive, Patrick Pouyanné, \"the leader of France's most polluting company\". The banner was quickly taken down by police.Several hundred activists belonging to Extinction Rebellion gathered outside Amundi for its general meeting. A few dozen protesters forced their way into Amundi's tower block, daubing graffiti on the walls and smashing some windows, police said. Amundi said eight of its security staff were injured. #DE\n#DS #PH #CS Police detain protesters outside Amundi's offices (Alt: The image shows police officers in dark uniforms and tactical gear detaining a protester in an urban setting.

Demand for oil was growing in line with the global population, he said.\nBut Pouyanné said TotalEnergies would pursue its \"balanced strategy\" of developing both fossil fuel and low-carbon energy production. TotalEnergies had proved it was possible \"to be a profitable, or even the most profitable, company while pursuing a transformation\" toward cleaner energy, he said.\nAt Friday's meeting, nearly 80% of shareholders approved the company's climate strategy, with more than 75% also voting to renew Pouyanné as CEO for three years. #NE"
