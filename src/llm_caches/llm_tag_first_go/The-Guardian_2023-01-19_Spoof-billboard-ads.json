Photograph: various #CE\nGuerrilla \"subvertisers\" have launched a campaign of spoof adverts targeting BMW and Toyota, aiming to reveal the truth behind the carmakers' claims to be going green. As the European Motor Show opened in Brussels, climate activists hijacked more than 400 advertising billboards and bus stops in Belgium, France, Germany and England.The posters were installed over the past few days by activists from Subvertisers International, Brandalism and Extinction Rebellion. Satirising the manufacturers' advertising messages, the billboards highlighted what activists describe as misleading adverts and aggressive lobbying tactics used by Toyota and BMW.Spoof BMW adverts ran on the London underground and on bus stops showing a family of crash-test dummies surrounded by fumes, with the message: #ME #MS \"When we test our emissions, the test dummy – is you.\" #MS In Brighton, a billboard was taken over by a vision of a cartoon climate dystopia, including dead animals, toxic waste and burning forests, with a Toyota 4x4 in the middle. The slogan read: \"Let's ruin everything.\" #ME #GE\n#PH #CS brandalism #CE\n#MS Tona Merriman, a spokesperson for Brandalism, said: \"Toyota have pushed their 'Beyond Zero' sustainability adverts whilst lobbying governments around the world to weaken air quality plans and threatening legal action to protect their profits over a livable climate. Their adverts are duplicitous.\"Brandalism said the pan-European subvertising actions were a call for greater government regulation of \"environmentally harmful products\" to prevent polluters making \"misleading green claims.\" Merriman added, \"Toyota and BMW use slick marketing campaigns to promote oversized SUV models that clog up urban neighbourhoods.\" #ME Both Toyota and BMW responded to the criticism, defending their environmental commitments and strategies for reducing emissions.\n#PH #CS A spoof Toyota advertisement in London #CE"
