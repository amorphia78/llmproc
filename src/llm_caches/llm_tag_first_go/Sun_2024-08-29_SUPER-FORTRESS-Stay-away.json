In the foreground, workers in high-visibility vests are installing metal security barriers near the castle gates. A truck is positioned on the left side, apparently delivering or setting up the barriers. Several people can be seen walking on the pathway. The enhanced security measures are clearly visible as temporary metal fencing extends across the area in front of the historic royal residence.) #CE #DE\n#NS The eco rabble #NE previously announced they would stage a mass occupation outside Windsor Castle to protest against the King — even though he is a green campaigner.#MS Climate activists claimed it is the \"embodiment of a broken and unjust system\".Extinction Rebellion says its occupation of Windsor Great Park is to urge the King to do yet more on green issues.The protest, called Upgrade Democracy, will not specifically target the King or any individual, it claims.Catherine Bartlett, of Extinction Rebellion UK, said: \"Windsor Castle has been chosen as an embodiment of a broken and unjust system where our message will resonate powerfully.\"We demand better at all levels; from the head of state to local councils but our central demand is for a Citizens' Assembly on Climate and Ecological Justice, which is needed more urgently now than ever before.\" #ME\n#DS #PH #CS Extinction Rebellion is planning three days of chaos from August 30 to September 1 (Alt: The image shows a stone fortress-like building with a prominent round tower under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a blue tractor pulls a green trailer filled with equipment or debris. Metal security barriers line the road near the building's entrance, creating a protective perimeter. The medieval-style architecture features thick stone walls and narrow windows typical of historic fortifications.) #CE #DE"
