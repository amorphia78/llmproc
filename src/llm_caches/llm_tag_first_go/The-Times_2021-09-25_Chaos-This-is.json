This is nothing, warns Cambridge graduate who brought M25 to standstill #GE\nSubtitle: #ES Cathy Eastburn, 54, is one of Britain's most prolific protesters and has been arrested at least 12 times in three years #EE\nContent: #GS Cathy Eastburn, 54, a Cambridge University philosophy graduate, has emerged as one of Britain's most prolific climate change activists. She was recently involved in a series of disruptive protests on the M25 motorway, organized by the group Insulate Britain.During these protests, #ES Eastburn was arrested four times in nine days #EE for her participation in blockading the UK's busiest motorway. The actions caused significant gridlock and risked fatal accidents, costing workers millions in lost earnings. One reported incident involved a woman being left paralysed due to delays in reaching the hospital after a stroke. #GE\n\n#MS Despite the chaos caused, Eastburn, a sound therapist and professional musician, insisted that the protests had been \"proportionate.\" She stated, \"Sitting in traffic for a few hours is awful but it's incomparable to the kind of chaos that's coming down the track — massive flooding and major food shortages.\" #ME\n#PH #CS Cathy Eastburn, shown being removed from a Docklands train, insists that her protests against climate change are \"proportionate\"DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/GETTY IMAGES; CLAIRE DOHERTY/PA #CE\n\nEastburn, who lives in a home worth almost £1 million near Clapham Common in south London, acknowledges her privileged position. She believes that as a white middle-aged woman, it's easier for her to navigate the criminal justice system.#MS The activist claims she is making these sacrifices for her children and for children everywhere. Eastburn was prompted to engage in non-violent direct action after a UN report on global warming in 2018. She likens her activism to that of the suffragettes and the US civil rights movement.\n\nDespite her numerous arrests, Eastburn remains committed to her cause. She argues that change can only come about through civil disobedience and states, \"I'm not proud of it. But I don't feel what I've done is criminal. I feel like I'm preventing a far greater crime.\" #ME"
