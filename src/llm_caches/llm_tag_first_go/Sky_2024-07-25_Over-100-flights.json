Eight people are currently in police custody, according to Last Generation.All runways were operational again by 7.50am local time (6.50am UK time) but the airport warned passengers that further delays and cancellations are expected later today. #DE #NS The airport said it \"sharply condemns\" the protest and \"reserves the right to take legal action\" adding that the protesters' actions \"pose severe danger... putting human life at risk\". #NE\n#DS #PH #CS Protesters cut holes in the fence to enter the premises.
