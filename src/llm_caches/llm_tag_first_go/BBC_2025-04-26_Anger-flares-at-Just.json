Police appeared to successfully call for the crowd to move away.The minivan was also carrying a child and at least one other passenger.People standing front of the vehicle, some holding a JSO banner, were seen holding their hands up, with one shouting to the police \"officer, I'm being pushed back\".The driver exited the vehicle and could be heard remonstrating with the protesters about the road being blocked. #DE #NS Police reminded the man the disruption was temporary and people had a right to protest.Other similar incidents of drivers apparently becoming frustrated with people in the road were also caught on camera. #NE\n#DS #PH #CS Hundreds of people rallied in Westminster on Saturday afternoon for Just Stop Oil's \"last day of action\" (Alt: The image shows a climate protest in Westminster with Big Ben visible in the background.
