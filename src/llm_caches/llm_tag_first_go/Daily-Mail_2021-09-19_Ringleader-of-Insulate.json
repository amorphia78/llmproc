The Home Secretary held an emergency Zoom call with police chiefs after protesters shut down the UK's busiest road during rush hour every 48 hours this week. A source close to the Home Secretary said she reiterated her message that 'these people are breaking the law and must be removed immediately'. #NE\n#ES #PH #CS Roger Hallam is prepared for hundreds of activists to end up behind bars during the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in November #CE #EE"
