He appears to be examining or setting up the device in a garden-like setting with green vegetation and fencing visible in the background. The scene takes place during daytime with natural lighting.) #CE\n#MS The intention was 'not to close it for a day, but some documents say a week, two weeks' and there are documents which show the intention was to close Heathrow 'indefinitely until the Government would agree publicly to reverse a national policy permitting the third runway extension at Heathrow'. #ME\nThere was no intention to cause any crash or to harm or endanger lives of individuals, but with the 'intention of causing inevitable chaos to the public' and 'massive disruption to the public, to flights in and out of this country'. #DE\nJudge Martin Edmunds KC said the small number of drones flown 'did not cause any disruption to flights'.#DS Hallam and Maxey were each sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for 18 months. Lynch-White was handed 17 months, suspended for 18 months. #DE\n#DS #PH #CS He is seen here minutes later being arrested by police (Alt: The image shows several police officers in light blue shirts and checkered caps arresting a bearded man in a plaid shirt. The officers are physically restraining and escorting the man, who appears to be Roger Hallam based on the context. The arrest is taking place outdoors near a metal fence with trees visible in the background.) #CE #DE"
