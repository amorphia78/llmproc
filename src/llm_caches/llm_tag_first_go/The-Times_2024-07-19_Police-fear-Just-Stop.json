I do hope it does have some deterrent effect. But for some, it might be a rallying call.\"\n#PH #CS The sentences handed down to Lucia Whittaker De Abreu, Cressida Gethin, Louise Lancaster, Daniel Shaw and Hallam have been widely criticised (Alt: Five people stand together with arms around each other's shoulders, smiling at the camera in front of a stone church building with flint walls.
