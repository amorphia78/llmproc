James Brown, who is visually impaired, climbed onto the Amsterdam-bound aircraft at London City Airport in October 2019. The 56-year-old glued his right hand to the plane and wedged his phone in the door to prevent it from closing. #GE #ES #NS Judge Gregory Perrins sentenced Brown to 12 months' imprisonment, of which he will serve half, at Southwark Crown Court. The judge stated, \"You cynically used your disability to put your plan into action,\" and added, \"The right to protest does not entitle you to cause major widespread disruption to a major airport... simply because you think it is the right thing to do.\" #NE #EE #GS Brown spent an hour on the aircraft before being removed. Prosecutors said he caused disruption to more than 300 British Airways passengers, costing the airline £40,000. The incident was part of a larger coordinated action, with the judge noting, \"This is a case in which you acted together with at least 10 other activists to plan and execute a major act of disruption.\" #GE\n#PH #CS Brown wept as he gave evidence at Southwark Crown Court #CE\n#ES Brown, who represented himself at trial, denied one count of causing a public nuisance, #EE #MS claiming he had \"to do something spectacular\" to draw attention to the climate crisis. #ME #ES He was found guilty in July after a jury deliberated for less than an hour. #EE #GS The double gold medallist from Exeter had booked his flight on the morning of the stunt and had a bottle of superglue in his luggage that went undetected by security. Brown declined assistance from cabin staff, informing them of his intention to climb onto the roof of the plane. #GE\n#GS #PH #CS Extinction Rebellion protesters targeted London City Airport in October 2019 #CE #GE"
