Is it worth more than food? Worth more than justice?\n#PH #CS Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland threw soup at the painting in 2022 (Alt: Two young women in white ) #CE\n\"Are you more concerned about the protection of a painting, or the protection of our planet and people? The cost of living crisis is part of the cost of oil crisis.\" #ME #NS Sentencing the eco-activists, Judge Christopher Hehir said the painting could have been \"seriously damaged or even destroyed\".\"Soup might have seeped through the glass,\" he continued.\"You couldn't have cared less if the painting was damaged or not.\"You had no right to do what you did to Sunflowers.\" #NE #DS Plummer also received a three-month jail term for her part in a slow march which caused long tailbacks in west London in November 2023. #DE"
