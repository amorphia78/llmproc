The defendants were able to get the prosecution to agree to a list of \"facts not in dispute\" relating to the climate crisis, including that climate change represented an \"existential threat to humanity\" and that in November 2022 the UK government had opened a new round of licensing for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea. #ME"
