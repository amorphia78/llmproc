The trial heard from Malcolm Richardson, a foreman and roofer who had a contract to carry out work at the house, who was asked to check the roof after a police officer investigating the protest said he believed there had been some damage caused.However, it was found that three of the 15 pictures used by the prosecution were actually of the same tile taken from different angles, and some had been taken after Mr Richardson had moved the tiles to carry out repairs. Mr Greenhall said there appeared to be cracks to tiles in parts of the roof where the protesters had not gone, and applied for the case to be thrown out because Richardson was only asked to look in one area when \"what should have been done is an examination of the entire roof\"."
