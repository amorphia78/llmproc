  "string_data": "consistency_issue The summary fails the consistency check by significantly altering the tone and balance of the original article. The original article presents a sympathetic, humanizing portrait of Louise Lancaster through extensive quotes from her family members who describe her as \"unrelentingly kind,\" someone who \"listens more than she speaks,\" and a \"sensitive soul\" who struggled with the decision to inconvenience people. The family's perspective dominates the original, explaining her careful reasoning process, her previous attempts at conventional activism, and the personal costs she has endured. In contrast, the summary strips away almost all of this humanizing context and family perspective, instead leading with and emphasizing the judge's characterization of Lancaster and others as having \"crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic.\" The summary focuses primarily on the disruption caused and the legal proceedings, while relegating the family's supportive view to just a brief mention in the subtitle. This fundamentally changes the article's tone from sympathetic and family-focused to more prosecution-focused, failing to maintain the original's balance between the disruptive effects and the personal story of why Lancaster felt compelled to act."
