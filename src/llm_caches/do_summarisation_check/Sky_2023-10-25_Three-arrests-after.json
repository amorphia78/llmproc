  "string_data": "form_issue The summarised article contains a duplication error where the subtitle \"The latest protest comes just weeks after the government backed the development of the UK's largest untapped oil and gas field - and follows similar action by other campaigners.\" appears twice - once at the beginning as intended, and again at the very end of the article. This repetition creates a structural problem that makes the summary implausible as a properly formatted news article."
