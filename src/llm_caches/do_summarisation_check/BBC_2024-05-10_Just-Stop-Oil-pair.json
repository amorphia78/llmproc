  "string_data": "consistency_issue The summary fails the consistency check by significantly altering the balance and tone of how the protest is portrayed. The original article maintains journalistic balance by including both the protesters' perspectives and critical viewpoints, ending with a strong condemnatory statement from the Crown Prosecution Service about the protesters showing \"utter lack of thought or care\" and emphasizing that \"when lawful protest crosses the line into criminality we won't hesitate to prosecute offenders.\" The summary removes this critical ending entirely, along with other balancing elements, resulting in a portrayal that is more sympathetic to the protesters than the original. This changes the overall tone from balanced reporting to one that leans more favorably toward the protesters' position."
