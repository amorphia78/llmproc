  "string_data": "consistency_issue, form_issue The summary has a consistency issue because it omits crucial elements that were central to the original story's narrative and impact. The original article emphasized key dramatic elements like the memory card smuggled out in a matchbox, Paul McCartney's letter to Putin, and the international campaign that helped free the activists. The summary reduces this to simply stating the charges were reduced and they were freed, without explaining how or why this happened. This significantly changes the balance and tone from a dramatic story of international intrigue and celebrity intervention to a much more mundane account. The summary has a form issue because it contains a duplicated opening line - \"THE new documentary investigates the British Greenpeace activists who planned to protest from the side of an oil rig in the Arctic\" appears twice consecutively, which is a formatting error that would not appear in a proper news article."
