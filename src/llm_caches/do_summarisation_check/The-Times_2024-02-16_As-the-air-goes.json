  "string_data": "consistency_issue The summary significantly alters the tone and balance of the original article regarding the Tyre Extinguishers protest action. The original article presents a more balanced view that includes both the protesters' perspective (calling SUVs \"polluting death machines\") and substantial negative impacts on victims like Knowles, including her full quote expressing fear and distress: \"I'm looking out the window at night just to see if they're outside. I don't want anyone near my vehicle. They could put the wrong thing in there, they could flatten it for all I know… They don't know why people need a vehicle.\" The summary truncates this quote, removing the more emotionally impactful portions about her fear and the protesters' lack of understanding of people's vehicle needs. Additionally, the original provides important context about Knowles using the vehicle through her disabled father's mobility allowance and explains that she didn't display her disabled badge, making her a target despite the group's policy not to target mobility vehicles. The summary omits these crucial details that help explain the problematic nature of the targeting, thus shifting the balance away from showing the negative consequences of the protest action."
