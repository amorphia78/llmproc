  "string_data": "consistency_issue The summary significantly alters the tone and balance of the original article. The original maintains a strong negative portrayal of the protesters throughout, describing them as \"eco zealots,\" a \"cult,\" and \"fanatics,\" with extensive coverage of the journalist's undercover operation, court proceedings, and vindication of The Sun's reporting. The summary removes most of this critical framing, including the cult-like characterization, the detailed account of the journalist's testimony and cross-examination, the judge's condemnation of the protesters as \"fanatics,\" and The Sun's celebration of their role in stopping the protest. The summary presents a more neutral account that focuses mainly on the basic facts of the plot and sentencing, losing the original's strongly negative editorial stance against the protesters."
