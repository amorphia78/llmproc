  "string_data": "new_material_issue The summary introduces new material not present in the original article. Specifically, the final paragraph states \"The protesters targeted the National Gallery's Van Gogh exhibition, demanding an end to new oil and gas projects. The three activists threw soup over the famous Sunflowers paintings before addressing horrified onlookers about their environmental demands and the imprisonment of fellow activists.\" This paragraph appears to be a newly written summary statement rather than content directly from the original article. While the individual facts may be derived from the original, this specific formulation and presentation of the information as a concluding paragraph is new material not found in the original text."
