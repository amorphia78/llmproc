  "string_data": "consistency_issue The summary significantly alters the tone and balance of the original article. The original is primarily a detailed, empathetic prison diary that focuses extensively on daily prison life, conditions, relationships with fellow inmates, and systemic issues with the prison system. The summary reduces this rich, humanizing account to a much more politically focused piece that emphasizes the protest sentences and comparisons to riot sentences. The original article dedicates the vast majority of its content to describing prison experiences, fellow inmates' stories, daily routines, and calls for prison reform. The summary eliminates almost all of this content and instead centers the narrative around sentence disparities and political messaging. This fundamentally changes the article from an intimate prison diary into a more activist-focused statement, losing the original's primary purpose of humanizing the prison experience and showing the author's personal journey through incarceration."
