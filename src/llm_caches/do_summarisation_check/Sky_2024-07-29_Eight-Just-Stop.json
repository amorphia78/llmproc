  "string_data": "form_issue The summarised article contains problematic elements inappropriate for a news article. Specifically, it ends abruptly without the concluding paragraphs from the original, and more importantly, it removes the final lines that were clearly part of the original news article format: \"Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News / Be the first to get Breaking News / Install the Sky News app for free\". While removing these promotional elements might seem reasonable, the summary also removes the final substantive news content about the two Just Stop Oil activists found guilty of criminal damage for throwing soup over Van Gogh's Sunflowers painting, which was relevant contextual information that belonged in the news article. Additionally, there appears to be some redundant repetition in the summary where the same information about activists sitting on the floor with lock-on devices is stated twice in slightly different ways."
