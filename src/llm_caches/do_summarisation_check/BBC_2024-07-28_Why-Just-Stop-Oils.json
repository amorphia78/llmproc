  "string_data": "consistency_issue The summary significantly alters the balance and tone of the original article. The original presents a comprehensive narrative that includes the historical context of environmental protests (Extinction Rebellion origins, evolution to Just Stop Oil), specific examples of protests beyond the M25 (Heathrow plot, sporting events, bridge climbing), detailed legal developments, and forward-looking analysis about potential European Court challenges. The summary reduces this rich context to focus primarily on the M25 case and basic legal framework, losing the article's balanced exploration of the ongoing \"game of legal chess\" between activists and the state. The original's nuanced discussion of whether harsh sentences will deter or embolden activists - including recent evidence of continued activism at Heathrow - is largely stripped away, making the summary appear more focused on the legal crackdown rather than the original's more balanced examination of the strategic dynamics between protesters and authorities."
