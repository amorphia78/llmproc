  "string_data": "consistency_issue, new_material_issue The summary has consistency issues because it removes crucial context that significantly changes how the protest is portrayed. The original article emphasizes that this soup-throwing incident occurred \"hours after their fellow protesters were jailed for doing the same\" and provides extensive detail about the previous sentencing, including the judge's harsh criticism and the substantial jail terms (2+ years). This context is essential to understanding the defiant nature of the repeat protest and the legal consequences activists face. By removing this context, the summary makes the protest appear as an isolated incident rather than a deliberate act of defiance following severe sentencing. The summary also contains new material not present in the original. The final paragraph attributes the questions \"What is worth more, art or life?...\" directly to \"The protesters\" from the recent incident. However, in the original article, these quotes are specifically attributed to Plummer from the 2022 incident (\"In 2022, Plummer said in front of the painting:\"). The summary incorrectly presents these as statements from the current protesters rather than historical quotes from a previous incident."
